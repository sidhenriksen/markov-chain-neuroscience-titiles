AB  - Although major depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious neuropsychiatric illness, it’s pathogenesis remains unclear. Current evidence suggests that the abnormal transmission and plasticity of hippocampal synapses play an important role in the pathogenesis of MDD. In this study, a two-dimensional gel-based proteomic approach to profile alterations of synaptosome protein expression was applied in the hippocampus of rats subjected to chronic mild stress.

Through mass spectrometry and database searching, 19 differentially expressed proteins were identified, of which 5 were up-regulated and 14 were down-regulated in the chronic mild-stressed group as compared with the control group. Subsequently, several proteins of interest were further validated by Western blotting. A detailed analysis of protein functions and disease relevance revealed that synaptic exo/endocytosis-associated proteins were dysregulated in the chronic mild-stressed rats.

The present study is the first reported synaptoproteomic analysis of the chronic mild-stressed rat hippocampus. The synaptic exo/endocytosis-associated proteins may participate in a central mechanism that underlies the abnormal transmission and plasticity of hippocampal synapses found in the chronic mild-stressed rats, and provides guidance to advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of MDD.

AB  - Puberty is a period characterized by brain reorganization that contributes to the development of neural and behavioral responses to gonadal steroids. A single injection of the bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), during the pubertal period decreases sexual receptivity in response to ovarian hormones in adulthood. Because chronic estradiol treatment alleviates depression-like symptoms in ovariectomized adult mice, we investigated the effect of pubertal LPS treatment on estradiol’s antidepressant effects. We hypothesized that pubertal LPS treatment would decrease the antidepressant-like effect of estradiol in adult ovariectomized female mice, as it decreases other behavioral responses to ovarian hormones. As expected, chronic estradiol treatment decreased depression-like behavior, as measured by the duration of immobility, in saline-treated mice from two different strains, as well as in mice treated with LPS in adulthood. In contrast, in mice treated pubertally with LPS, estradiol strikingly increased the duration of immobility. No difference in body weight and in locomotion was found among the groups, suggesting that the differences in depression-like behavior were not due to differences in body weight or locomotor activity between LPS-treated and control mice. These results suggest that exposure to an immune challenge during the pubertal period alters the responsiveness of depression-like behavior to estradiol.

AB  - Anxiety and depression are the most prevalent of the psychiatric disorders. The average age of onset of these disorders is in adolescence, and stressful experiences are recognized as an important pathway to such dysfunction. Until recently, however, most animal models of these disorders involved adult males. We provide a brief overview of anxiety and depression and the extent to which adolescent rodents are a valid model for their investigation, and briefly review the main measures of anxiety-like and depressive behaviour in rodents. The focus of the review is investigations in which adolescent rodents were exposed to chronic stressors, describing our research using social instability stress and that of other researchers using various social and non-social stressors. The evidence to date suggests stress in adolescence alters the trajectory of brain development, and particularly that of the hippocampus, increasing anxiety and depressive behaviour in adulthood.

AB  - While the effects of progesterone in the CNS, like those of estrogen, have generally been considered within the context of reproductive function, growing evidence supports its importance in regulating non-reproductive functions including cognition and affect. In addition, progesterone has well-described protective effects against numerous insults in a variety of cell models, animal models and in humans. While ongoing research in several laboratories continues to shed light on the mechanism(s) by which progesterone and its related progestins exert their effects in the CNS, our understanding is still incomplete. Among the key mediators of progesterone’s beneficial effects is the family of growth factors called neurotrophins. Here, we review the mechanisms by which progesterone regulates one important member of the neurotrophin family, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and provides support for its pivotal role in the protective program elicited by progesterone in the brain.

AB  - Preproglucagon (PPG) neurons produce glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and occur primarily in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). GLP-1 affects a variety of central autonomic circuits, including those controlling the cardiovascular system, thermogenesis, and most notably energy balance. Our immunohistochemical studies in transgenic mice expressing YFP under the control of the PPG promoter showed that PPG neurons project widely to central autonomic regions, including brainstem nuclei. Functional studies have highlighted the importance of hindbrain receptors for the anorexic effects of GLP-1.

In this study, we assessed YFP innervation of neurochemically identified brainstem neurons in transgenic YFP–PPG mice. Immunoreactivity for YFP plus choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and/or serotonin (5-HT) was visualised with two- or three-colour immunoperoxidase labelling using black (YFP), brown and blue-grey reaction products.

In the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV), terminals from fine YFP-immunoreactive axons closely apposed a small proportion of ChAT-positive and rare TH-positive/ChAT-positive motor neurons, mostly ventral to AP. YFP-immunoreactive innervation was virtually absent from the compact and loose formations of the nucleus ambiguus. In the NTS, some TH-immunoreactive neurons were closely apposed by YFP-containing axons. In the A1/C1 column in the ventrolateral medulla, close appositions on TH-positive neurons were more common, particularly in the caudal portion of the column. A single YFP-immunoreactive axon usually provided 1–3 close appositions on individual ChAT- or TH-positive neurons. Serotonin-immunoreactive neurons were most heavily innervated, with the majority of raphé pallidus, raphé obscurus and parapyramidal neurons receiving several close appositions from large varicosities of YFP-immunoreactive axons.

These results indicate that GLP-1 neurons innervate various populations of brainstem autonomic neurons. These include vagal efferent neurons and catecholamine neurons in areas linked with cardiovascular control. Our data also indicate a synaptic connection between GLP-1 neurons and 5-HT neurons, some of which might contribute to the regulation of appetite.

AB  - The neuroprotective role of 17β-estradiol is well known; however, its mechanism of action remains unclear. In the present study, we applied light-induced apoptosis on the Sprague–Dawley rat retina to determine the neuroprotective effect of intravitreal administration of 17β-estradiol on retinal neurons and to demonstrate its underlying mechanism of action. Fourteen days after ovariectomy, adult female Sprague–Dawley rats received light damage. The functional and morphological changes of the retina were monitored by electroretinogram and hematoxylin and eosin staining, respectively. Retinal apoptosis was characterized by the presence of DNA laddering and positive terminal deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) nick-end labeling. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-specific inhibitor LY294002 was used to elucidate whether the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was activated by 17β-estradiol. Western blotting was used to detect the activation of caspase 3 and Akt. Immunofluorescence was performed to determine the translocation of NF-κB. Our data showed that exposure to 8000 lux white light for 12 h resulted in functional damage to the rat retina, histological changes and retinal neuronal apoptosis. 17β-Estradiol significantly rescued retinal function by preventing neuronal apoptosis. Moreover, the inhibition of Akt activation by LY294002 increased retinal neuronal apoptosis, demonstrating that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is involved. Levels of cleaved caspase-3 were suppressed in the presence of 17β-estradiol, while LY294002 reversed the effects. It is noteworthy that NF-κB p65 also translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after 17β-estradiol administration. This translocation was inhibited by pre-injection of LY294002. Taken together, these results indicate that 17β-estradiol intravitreal administration protects the function of the rat retina by preventing retinal neuronal apoptosis from light damage. In addition, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is activated, which inhibits caspase-3 activation and induces NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation.

AB  - Glucocorticoids serve as key stress response hormones that facilitate stress coping. However, sustained glucocorticoid exposure is associated with adverse consequences on the brain, in particular within the hippocampus. Chronic glucocorticoid exposure evokes neuronal cell damage and dendritic atrophy, reduces hippocampal neurogenesis and impairs synaptic plasticity. Glucocorticoids also alter expression and signaling of the neurotrophin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Since BDNF is known to promote neuroplasticity, enhance cell survival, increase hippocampal neurogenesis and cellular excitability, it has been hypothesized that specific adverse effects of glucocorticoids may be mediated by attenuating BDNF expression and signaling. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current state of literature examining the influence of glucocorticoids on BDNF, and to address whether specific effects of glucocorticoids arise through perturbation of BDNF signaling. We integrate evidence of glucocorticoid regulation of BDNF at multiple levels, spanning from the well-documented glucocorticoid-induced changes in BDNF mRNA to studies examining alterations in BDNF receptor-mediated signaling. Further, we delineate potential lines of future investigation to address hitherto unexplored aspects of the influence of glucocorticoids on BDNF. Finally, we discuss the current understanding of the contribution of BDNF to the modulation of structural and functional plasticity by glucocorticoids, in particular in the context of the hippocampus. Understanding the mechanistic crosstalk between glucocorticoids and BDNF holds promise for the identification of potential therapeutic targets for disorders associated with the dysfunction of stress hormone pathways.

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a secreted protein that has been linked to numerous aspects of plasticity in the central nervous system (CNS). Stress-induced remodeling of the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and amygdala is coincident with changes in the levels of BDNF, which has been shown to act as a trophic factor facilitating the survival of existing and newly born neurons. Initially, hippocampal atrophy after chronic stress was associated with reduced BDNF, leading to the hypothesis that stress-related learning deficits resulted from suppressed hippocampal neurogenesis. However, recent evidence suggests that BDNF also plays a rapid and essential role in regulating synaptic plasticity, providing another mechanism through which BDNF can modulate learning and memory after a stressful event. Numerous reports have shown BDNF levels are highly dynamic in response to stress, and not only vary across brain regions but also fluctuate rapidly, both immediately after a stressor and over the course of a chronic stress paradigm. Yet, BDNF alone is not sufficient to effect many of the changes observed after stress. Glucocorticoids and other molecules have been shown to act in conjunction with BDNF to facilitate both the morphological and molecular changes that occur, particularly changes in spine density and gene expression. This review briefly summarizes the evidence supporting BDNF’s role as a trophic factor modulating neuronal survival, and will primarily focus on the interactions between BDNF and other systems within the brain to facilitate synaptic plasticity. This growing body of evidence suggests a more nuanced role for BDNF in stress-related learning and memory, where it acts primarily as a facilitator of plasticity and is dependent upon the coactivation of glucocorticoids and other factors as the determinants of the final cellular response.

AB  - Neurotrophic factors and steroid hormones interact to regulate a variety of neuronal processes such as neurite outgrowth, differentiation, and neuroprotection. The coexpression of steroid hormone and neurotrophin receptor mRNAs and proteins, as well as their reciprocal regulation provides the necessary substrates for such interactions to occur. This review will focus on androgen brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) interactions in the spinal cord, describing androgen regulation of BDNF in neuromuscular systems following castration, androgen manipulation, and injury. Androgens interact with BDNF during development to regulate normally-occurring motoneuron death, and in adulthood, androgen–BDNF interactions are involved in the maintenance of several features of neuromuscular systems. Androgens regulate BDNF and trkB expression in spinal motoneurons. Androgens also regulate BDNF levels in the target musculature, and androgenic action at the muscle regulates BDNF levels in motoneurons. These interactions have important implications for the maintenance of motoneuron morphology. Finally, androgens interact with BDNF after injury, influencing soma size, dendritic morphology, and axon regeneration. Together, these findings provide further insight into the development and maintenance of neuromuscular systems and have implications for the neurotherapeutic/neuroprotective roles of androgens and trophic factors in the treatment of motoneuron disease and recovery from injury.

AB  - Dopamine (DA) plays fundamental roles as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator in the central nervous system. How DA modulates the electrical excitability of individual neurons to elicit various behaviors is of great interest in many systems. The buccal ganglion of the freshwater pond snail Helisoma trivolvis contains the neuronal circuitry for feeding and DA is known to modulate the feeding motor program in Helisoma. The buccal neuron B5 participates in the control of gut contractile activity and is surrounded by dopaminergic processes, which are expected to release DA. In order to study whether DA modulates the electrical activity of individual B5 neurons, we performed experiments on physically isolated B5 neurons in culture and on B5 neurons within the buccal ganglion in situ. We report that DA application elicited a strong hyperpolarization in both conditions and turned the electrical activity from a spontaneously firing state to an electrically silent state. Using the cell culture system, we demonstrated that the strong hyperpolarization was inhibited by the D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride and the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122, indicating that DA affected the membrane potential of B5 neurons through the activation of a D2-like receptor and PLC. Further studies revealed that the DA-induced hyperpolarization was inhibited by the K channel blockers 4-aminopyridine and tetraethylammonium, suggesting that K channels might serve as the ultimate target of DA signaling. Through its modulatory effect on the electrical activity of B5 neurons, the release of DA in vivo may contribute to a neuronal output that results in a variable feeding motor program.

In this review, we summarize what is currently known about stress during adolescence, how it impacts risky decision-making, and how acute stress may exert neurobiological effects on circuitry that subserves decision-making in the developing brain. We conclude by suggesting future research directions that may help the field gain traction on this important, but relatively understudied, question.

AB  - The genetic, biological, and environmental backgrounds of an organism fundamentally influence the balance between risk and resilience to stress. Sex, age, and environment transact with responses to trauma in ways that can mitigate or exacerbate the likelihood that post-traumatic stress disorder will develop. Translational approaches to modeling affective disorders in animals will ultimately provide novel treatments and a better understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings behind these debilitating disorders. The extant literature on trauma/stress has focused predominately on limbic and cortical structures that innervate the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and influence glucocorticoid-mediated negative feedback. It is through these neuroendocrine pathways that a self-perpetuating fear memory can propagate the long-term effects of early life trauma. Recent work incorporating translational approaches has provided novel pathways that can be influenced by early life stress, such as the glucocorticoid receptor chaperones, including FKBP51. Animal models of stress have differing effects on behavior and endocrine pathways; however, complete models replicating clinical characteristics of risk and resilience have not been rigorously studied. This review discusses a four-factor model that considers the importance of studying both risk and resilience in understanding the developmental response to trauma/stress. Consideration of the multifactorial nature of clinical populations in the design of preclinical models and the application of preclinical findings to clinical treatment approaches comprise the core of translational reciprocity, which is discussed in the context of the four-factor model.

AB  - Oxidative stress and inflammation play an integral role in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia that leads to a cascade of events culminating in the death of neurons and their supporting structures. The signaling pathways that link these events are not fully understood. Recent studies have demonstrated a close link between the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced inflammation. Flavonoids have been suggested to exert human health benefits by anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. In this study we undertook a pharmacological approach to investigate the ability of naringenin, a potent flavonoid, to prevent oxidative stress and NF-κB-mediated inflammatory brain damage in the rat model of focal cerebral I/R injury. To test this hypothesis, male Wistar rats were pretreated with naringenin once daily for 21 days and then subjected to 1 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by 23 h of reperfusion. Naringenin treatment successfully upregulates the antioxidant status, decreases the infarct size and lowers the levels of myeloperoxidase, nitric oxide and cytokines, besides functional recovery returned close to the baseline. Moreover, immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses clearly demonstrated that naringenin treatment limits glial activation and downregulates the NF-κB expression level and their target genes. These results show, prophylactic treatment with naringenin improved functional outcomes and abrogated the ischemic brain injury by suppressing NF-κB-mediated neuroinflammation. The present study suggests that naringenin may be used as a potential neuroprotectant in patients at high risk of ischemic stroke.

AB  - Gelsolin is an actin filament-severing and capping protein, affecting cellular motility, adhesiveness and apoptosis. Whether it is expressed in the brain of burned mice has not yet been characterized. Mice were subjected to a 15% total body surface area scald injury. Neuropathology was examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Cerebral gelsolin mRNA, distribution and cleavage were demonstrated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR), immunohistochemistry and Western blot, respectively. Cysteinyl aspartate-specific protease (caspase)-3-positive cells and activity were also measured. Burn injury could induce pathological alterations in the brain including leukocyte infiltration, necrosis, microabscess and gliosis. Compared with sham-injured mice, gelsolin mRNA was up-regulated at 8 h post-burn (pb) in a transient manner in the cortex and striatum of burned mice, while it remained at higher levels in the hippocampus up to 72 h pb. Of interest, gelsolin was further cleaved into 42 and 48 kDa (kilo Dalton) fragments as illustrated in the hippocampus at 24 h pb, and was widely expressed in the brain by activated monocyte/macrophages, astrocytes and damaged neurons. In the meantime, caspase-3-positive cells were noted in the striatum of burned mice and its activity peaked at 24 h pb. To clarify inflammation-induced gelsolin expression and cleavage in the brain, rat pheochromocytoma cells were exposed to lipopolysaccharide to show increased gelsolin expression and caspase-3-dependent cleavage. The results suggest that burn-induced cerebral gelsolin expression would be involved in the activation of both the monocytes and astroglial cells, thereby playing a crucial role in the subsequent inflammation-induced neural apoptosis following burn injury.

AB  - During development of the nervous system, the formation of connections (synapses) between neurons is dependent upon electrical activity in those neurons, and neurotrophic factors produced by target cells play a pivotal role in such activity-dependent sculpting of the neural networks. A similar interplay between neurotransmitter and neurotrophic factor signaling pathways mediates adaptive responses of neural networks to environmental demands in adult mammals, with the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) being particularly prominent regulators of synaptic plasticity throughout the central nervous system. Optimal brain health throughout the lifespan is promoted by intermittent challenges such as exercise, cognitive stimulation and dietary energy restriction, that subject neurons to activity-related metabolic stress. At the molecular level, such challenges to neurons result in the production of proteins involved in neurogenesis, learning and memory and neuronal survival; examples include proteins that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, protein quality control, and resistance of cells to oxidative, metabolic and proteotoxic stress. BDNF signaling mediates up-regulation of several such proteins including the protein chaperone GRP-78, antioxidant enzymes, the cell survival protein Bcl-2, and the DNA repair enzyme APE1. Insufficient exposure to such challenges, genetic factors may conspire to impair BDNF production and/or signaling resulting in the vulnerability of the brain to injury and neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases. Further, BDNF signaling is negatively regulated by glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids impair synaptic plasticity in the brain by negatively regulating spine density, neurogenesis and long-term potentiation, effects that are potentially linked to glucocorticoid regulation of BDNF. Findings suggest that BDNF signaling in specific brain regions mediates some of the beneficial effects of exercise and energy restriction on peripheral energy metabolism and the cardiovascular system. Collectively, the findings described in this article suggest the possibility of developing prescriptions for optimal brain health based on activity-dependent BDNF signaling.

AB  - Recent data suggest that there may be distinct processing streams emanating from auditory cortical layers 5 and 6 that influence the auditory midbrain. To determine whether these projections have different physiological properties, we injected rhodamine-tagged latex tracer beads into the inferior colliculus of &gt;30-day-old mice to label these corticofugal cells. Whole-cell recordings were performed on 62 labeled cells to determine their basic electrophysiological properties and cells were filled with biocytin to determine their morphological characteristics. Layer 5 auditory corticocollicular cells have prominent Ih-mediated sag and rebound currents, have relatively sluggish time constants, and can generate calcium-dependent rhythmic bursts. In contrast, layer 6 auditory corticocollicular cells are non-bursting, do not demonstrate sag or rebound currents and have short time constants. Quantitative analysis of morphology showed that layer 6 cells are smaller, have a horizontal orientation, and have very long dendrites (&gt;500 μm) that branch profusely both near the soma distally near the pia. Layer 5 corticocollicular cells are large pyramidal cells with a long apical dendrite with most branching near the pial surface. The marked differences in physiological properties and dendritic arborization between neurons in layers 5 and 6 make it likely that each type plays a distinct role in controlling auditory information processing in the midbrain.

AB  - Neural stem cells, which reside mainly in the subventricular and subgranular zones of the hippocampus, can regenerate new neuroblasts after various brain insults. Aided by vascular remodeling, these new neuroblasts migrate long distances to injured brain regions. Studies have suggested that high-mobility group box1 (HMGB1), a nonhistone nuclear DNA-binding protein, may stimulate such remodeling in the late phase of some types of brain injury, but it is unclear whether this is true for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Here we used a rat model of collagenase-induced ICH to determine whether HMGB1 can promote neurogenesis and angiogenesis in the late phase of injury. Daily administration of ethyl pyruvate, which inhibited HMGB1 expression, reduced the recovery of neurological function, decreased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) levels in the ipsilateral striatum, and decreased the numbers of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)- and doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells around the hematoma. These findings suggest that HMGB1 may promote angiogenesis and neurogenesis in the late phase of ICH.

AB  - Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a general mediator of cell death in response to a variety of stimuli, including reactive oxygen species, tumor necrosis factor α, lipopolysaccharide, endoplasmic reticulum stress, calcium influx and ischemia. Here we reported ASK1 was activated by nitric oxide (NO) through S-nitrosylation during cerebral ischemia–reperfusion. The reagents that abrogate neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activity such as nNOS inhibitor 7NI and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist MK801 prevented ASK1 activation via decreasing ASK1 S-nitrosylation. In HEK293 cells, over-expressed ASK1 could be S-nitrosylated by both exogenous and endogenous NO and Cys869 was identified as the site of ASK1 S-nitrosylation. S-nitrosylation increased the level of ASK1 phosphorylation at Thr845, which represents ASK1 activation. Our results further confirmed that S-nitrosylation led to the increment of ASK1 dimerization. S-nitrosylation of ASK1 also activated the downstream JNK signaling and JNK-mediated nucleic pathway. The exogenous NO (SNP and GSNO) reversed the effect of endogenous NO by suppressing S-nitrosylation of ASK1 and exerted neuroprotection during ischemia–reperfusion. These results suggest that inhibiting ASK1 S-nitrosylation may be a novel approach for stroke therapy.

AB  - The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis underlies both adaptive and maladaptive responses to stress and may be an important marker of childhood vulnerability to psychopathology, although little is known about genetic variants that influence cortisol reactivity. We therefore examined associations between corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) system gene (CRH, CRHR1 and CRHBP) variants and cortisol reactivity in preschoolers. A community sample of 409 three-year-old children completed a standardized stress task to elicit HPA axis activation. Salivary samples were obtained at the baseline and at 10-min intervals post-stress for a total of six samples. Salivary cortisol was measured using standard ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) protocols and cortisol reactivity was operationalized by calculating cortisol change scores ([baseline] − [peak cortisol post-stressor]). A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker panel containing 18 SNPs was used to tag the full-length CRH (4 SNPs), CRHR1 (7 SNPs) and CRHBP (7 SNPs) genes. Significant main effects on children’s cortisol reactivity (all ps &lt; 0.05) were found for loci on CRHR1 and CRHBP. Haplotypes of the CRHR1 linkage region were also associated with cortisol reactivity (all ps &lt; 0.01). Additionally, we found multiple interactions between tag-SNPs in all three gene-coding regions predicting cortisol reactivity (all ps &lt; 0.05). Individual differences in children’s cortisol reactivity are related to genetic variation in CRH system gene-coding regions. Our results have important implications for future research on the role of HPA axis function in the development of disorders such as anxiety and depression.

AB  - In adult rodents, endocannabinoids (eCBs) regulate fast glucocorticoid (GC) feedback in the hypothalamus–pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, acting as retrograde messengers that bind to cannabinoid receptors (CB1R) and inhibit glutamate release from presynaptic CRH neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). During the first two weeks of life, rat pups exhibit significant CRH and ACTH responses to stress although the adrenal GC output remains reduced. At the same time, pups also display increased sensitivity to GC feedback, but it is unclear whether eCBs play a role in mediating fast GC feedback in neonatal life. In our studies, we examined the role of eCBs in the rapid suppression of anoxia-induced ACTH release and determined whether eCB action could be modulated by the levels of circulating GCs present at the time of stress. PND8 pups were subjected to 3-min anoxia with AM251, a CB1R blocker, injected 30 min prior to stress onset. The effects of either metyrapone (MET) (a steroidogenic 11beta-hydroxylase blocker) or methylprednisolone (PRED) (a synthetic GC) pretreatment on AM251 effect and the stress response were evaluated. Treatment with AM251 before stress onset tended to increase overall ACTH and CORT secretion, and also delayed the return to baseline ACTH. The AM251 effect on ACTH in PND8 pups was lost in MET-treated pups, who exhibited high basal and stimulated ACTH release and no CORT response to stress. Methylprednisolone suppressed ACTH stress responses although AM251 still delayed restoration of ACTH levels to the baseline. This suggests that the eCB effect on ACTH secretion in neonates is most evident when there is a dynamic fluctuation of corticosterone levels. Interestingly, AM251 increased basal and stimulated corticosterone secretion in all treatments including MET, suggestive of a direct action of CB1R blockade on adrenal steroidogenesis.

AB  - Peripheral-nerve injuries are a common clinical problem and often result in long-term functional deficits. Reconstruction of peripheral-nerve defects is currently undertaken with nerve autografts. However, there is a limited availability of nerves that can be sacrificed and the functional recovery is never 100% satisfactory. We have previously shown that gene therapy with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) significantly improved nerve regeneration, neuronal survival, and muscle activity. Our hypothesis is that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) synergizes with VEGF to improve the functional outcome after sciatic nerve transection. The left sciatic nerves and the adjacent muscle groups of adult mice were exposed, and 50 or 100 μg (in 50 μl PBS) of VEGF and/or G-CSF genes was injected locally, just below the sciatic nerve, and transferred by electroporation. The sciatic nerves were transected and placed in an empty polycaprolactone (PCL) nerve guide, leaving a 3-mm gap to challenge nerve regeneration. After 6 weeks, the mice were perfused and the sciatic nerve, the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), the spinal cord and the gastrocnemius muscle were processed for light and transmission electron microscopy. Treated animals showed significant improvement in functional and histological analyses compared with the control group. However, the best results were obtained with the G-CSF + VEGF-treated animals: quantitative analysis of regenerated nerves showed a significant increase in the number of myelinated fibers and blood vessels, and the number of neurons in the DRG and motoneurons in the spinal cord was significantly higher. Motor function also showed that functional recovery occurred earlier in animals receiving G-CSF + VEGF-treatment. The gastrocnemius muscle showed an increase in weight and in the levels of creatine phosphokinase, suggesting an improvement of reinnervation and muscle activity. These results suggest that these two factors acted synergistically and optimized the nerve repair potential, improving regeneration after a transection lesion.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a complex constellation of positive, negative and cognitive symptoms. Acute administration of the non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dizocilpine (MK801) in rats is one of few preclinical animal models of this disorder that has both face and/or construct validity for these multiple at-risk behavioral domains and predictive power for the efficacy of therapeutic drugs in treating them. This study asked whether and to what extent the rat NMDAR hypofunction model also embodies the sex differences that distinguish the symptoms of schizophrenia and their treatment. Thus, we compared the effects of acute MK801, with and without pretreatment with haloperidol or clozapine, on seven discrete spontaneous open-field activities in adult male and female rats. These analyses revealed that MK801 was more effective in stimulating ataxia and locomotion and inhibiting stationary behavior in females while more potently stimulating stereotypy and thigmotaxis and inhibiting rearing and grooming in males. Haloperidol and clozapine pretreatments had markedly different efficacies in terms of behaviors but strong similarities in their effectiveness in male and female subjects. These results bear intriguing relationships with the complex male/female differences that characterize the symptoms of schizophrenia and suggest possible applications for acute NMDAR hypofunction as a preclinical model for investigating the neurobiology that underlies them.

AB  - This study investigated the modular control of complex locomotor tasks that require fast changes in direction, i.e., cutting manoeuvres. It was hypothesized that such tasks are accomplished by an impulsive (burst-like) activation of a few motor modules, as observed during walking and running. It was further hypothesized that the performance in cutting manoeuvres would be associated to the relative timing of the activation impulses. Twenty-two healthy men performed 90° side-step cutting manoeuvres while electromyography (EMG) activity from 16 muscles of the supporting limb and trunk, kinematics, and ground reaction forces were recorded. Motor modules and their respective temporal activations were extracted from the EMG signals by non-negative matrix factorization. The kinematic analysis provided the velocity of the centre of mass and the external work absorbed during the load acceptance (negative work, external work during absorption (W-Abs)) and propulsion phases (positive work, external work during propulsion (W-Prp)) of the cutting manoeuvres. Five motor modules explained the EMG activity of all muscles and were driven in an impulsive way, with timing related to the initial contact (M2), load acceptance (M3), and propulsion (M4). The variability in timing between impulses across subjects was greater for cutting manoeuvres than for running. The timing difference between M2 and M3 in the cutting manoeuvres was significantly associated to W-Abs (r2 = 0.45) whereas the timing between M3 and M4 was associated to W-Prp (r2 = 0.43). These results suggest that complex locomotor tasks can be achieved by impulsive activation of muscle groups, and that performance is associated to the specific timing of the activation impulses.

AB  - As a widely used intravenous short-acting anesthetic, propofol is recently indicated by clinical and animal studies for its abuse potential, but the mechanism underlying propofol abuse is largely unknown. This study examined the contribution of dopamine receptor subtype (D1 and D2 receptors) and neuroanatomical locus (i.e. nuclear accumbens) in the maintenance of propofol self-administration in rats. After the acquisition and maintenance of self-administration of propofol (1.7 mg/kg/infusion) under a fixed ratio (FR1) schedule of reinforcement over 14 days, rats were treated by either intraperitoneal injection or intra-nucleus accumbens (NAc) injection of D1 receptor antagonist (SCH23390) or D2 receptor antagonists (spiperone and eticlopride) 10 min prior to the subsequent propofol self-administration. We demonstrated (i) systemic administration of SCH23390 (10, 30, 100 μg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently decreased the rate of propofol-maintained self-administration, suggesting a critical role of the D1 receptor in mediating propofol self-administration; (ii) the blockade of the propofol self-administration by SCH23390 was specific since spiperone and eticlopride did not affect propofol self-administration and SCH23390 at these doses did not affect food-maintained responding under an FR5 schedule; (iii) intra-accumbenal injection of SCH23390 (2.5 μg/site) but not eticopride (3.0 μg/site) attenuated the propofol self-administration, localizing nuclear accumbal D1 receptors as a critical locus in the reinforcement of propofol. Together, these findings provide the first direct evidence that D1 receptors in nuclear accumbens play an important role in the maintenance of propofol self-administration.

AB  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) belongs to a family of ligand-activated transcription factors, and its ligands are known to control many physiological and pathological conditions. The hypothesis of our study was that the PPARγ agonist (rosiglitazone) could mediate tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) related to the regulation of human neural stem cells (hNSCs), by which TNFα possibly fulfills important roles in neuronal impairment. The results show that PPARγ mediates the cell viability of hNSCs via the downregulation of the activity of caspase 3, indicating that this rescue effect of PPARγ could improve the reduced levels of two mitochondrial regulators, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in the hNSCs with TNFα. The stimulation of mitochondrial function by PPARγ was associated with activation of the PPAR coactivator1 alpha (PGC1α) pathway by up-regulation of oxidative defense and mitochondrial systems. The above protective effects appeared to be exerted by a direct activation of the rosiglitazone, because it protected hNSCs from TNFα-evoked oxidative stress and mitochondrial deficiency. Here we show that the rosiglitazone protects hNSCs against Aβ-induced apoptosis and promotes cell survival. These findings extend our understanding of the central role of PPARγ in TNFα-related neuronal impairment, which probably increases risks of neurodegenerative diseases. The anti-inflammatory effects of PPARγ in the hNSCs with TNFα, and the involved mechanisms were also characterized.

AB  - Stanniocalcin 1 (STC1), originally described as an antihypercalcemic hormone in fish, is highly expressed in differentiated mammalian neurons. Mild hypoxic treatment and focal cerebral ischemia induce upregulation of STC1 in the brain. These findings prompted us to investigate whether STC1 contributes to neuroprotection after ischemia and whether STC1 is required for development of ischemic tolerance. We induced 60 minutes of temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion in wild type (WT) and STC1-deficient mice (STC1-/-) with or without prior hypoxic preconditioning (HPC, 8% oxygen for 6 hours followed by reoxygenation for 24 hours). Infarct sizes, neurological scores, and Stc1, Stc2, and Il-6 mRNA brain levels were measured 24 hours after ischemia. Additionally, we examined blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity (Evans Blue fluorescence) under normal conditions and 0 and 24 hours after hypoxia. STC1-/- and WT mice developed brain infarcts of similar size. In both strains, HPC triggered ischemic tolerance with similar reduction in infarct size. However, STC1-/- mice had worse neurological scores in both scenarios. HPC induced upregulation of STC1 and STC2 in WT mice and of STC2 in STC1-/- mice. Ischemic STC1-/- mice showed significantly lower Il-6 mRNA expression than ischemic WT mice. Evans Blue fluorescence levels showed no difference in between WT and STC1-/- mice under evaluated conditions, thus BBB integrity is preserved despite STC1 deficiency. STC1 was not crucial for the development of ischemic tolerance triggered by HPC or for preserving BBB integrity but may be involved in functional recovery after stroke.

AB  - Better treatment of status epilepticus (SE), which typically becomes refractory after about 30 min, will require new pharmacotherapies. The effect of sec-butyl-propylacetamide (SPD), an amide derivative of valproic acid (VPA), on electrographic status epilepticus (ESE) was compared quantitatively to other standard-of-care compounds. Cortical electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded from rats during ESE induced with lithium-pilocarpine. Using a previously-published algorithm, the effects of SPD on ESE were compared quantitatively to other relevant compounds. To confirm benzodiazepine resistance, diazepam (DZP) was shown to suppress ESE when administered 15 min after the first motor seizure, but not after 30 min (100 mg/kg). VPA (300 mg/kg) also lacked efficacy at 30 min. SPD (130 mg/kg) strongly suppressed ESE at 30 min, less after 45 min, and not at 60 min. At a higher dose (180 mg/kg), SPD profoundly suppressed ESE at 60 min, similar to propofol (100 mg/kg) and pentobarbital (30 mg/kg). After 4–6 h of SPD-induced suppression, EEG activity often overshot control levels at 7–12 h. Valnoctamide (VCD, 180 mg/kg), an SPD homolog, was also efficacious at 30 min. SPD blocks pilocarpine-induced electrographic seizures when administered at 1 h after the first motor seizure. SPD has a faster onset and greater efficacy than DZP and VPA, and is similar to propofol and pentobarbital. SPD and structurally similar compounds may be useful for the treatment of refractory ESE. Further development and use of automated analyses of ESE may facilitate drug discovery for refractory SE.

AB  - Astrocytes become activated in degenerative neurological diseases. In order to gain a greater understanding of the inflammatory factors released upon activation, we stimulated adult human astrocytes with interferon-gamma and examined the resultant conditioned medium (CM) for toxicity against differentiated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Cell death was measured by lactate dehydrogenase release assay. We then used various treatments of the media to determine the distribution and nature of the toxic components.

Removal of interleukin-6 by a specific antibody reduced the toxicity by 22%. Blockade of proteases with an inhibitor cocktail reduced it by a further 22%. When oxygen-free radical production was blocked with NADPH oxidase inhibitors, the toxicity was reduced by 15.4%. When prostaglandin production was blocked by cyclooxygenase inhibitors, the toxicity of the CM was reduced by 14.5%. When glutamate was removed by treatment with glutamate decarboxylase, the toxicity was reduced by 10.3%. When the inhibitors were added together to the astrocyte culture, the total toxicity of the CM was reduced by 91%. This was in reasonable agreement with the 85.37% total obtained by adding the individual components. The data show that activated astrocytes release a specific combination of neurotoxic compounds. They suggest that effective anti-inflammatory treatment of such neurodegenerative diseases as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis could be improved by using an appropriate combination of anti-inflammatory agents instead of relying on any single agent.

AB  - The present study was conducted to correlate rotenone-induced neurotoxicity with cellular and molecular modifications in neuronal and neuronal supportive cells in rat brain regions. Rotenone was administered (3, 6 and 12 μg/μl) intranigrally in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. After the 7th day of rotenone treatment, specific protein markers for neuronal cells – tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), astroglial cells – glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), microglial cells – CD11b/c, and Iba-1 were evaluated by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence in the striatum (STR) and mid brain (MB). Apoptotic cell death was assessed by caspase-3 gene expression. Higher doses of rotenone significantly lowered TH protein levels and elevated Iba-1 levels in MB. All the doses of rotenone significantly increased GFAP and CD11b/c protein in the MB. In STR, rotenone elevated GFAP levels but did not affect TH, CD11b/c and Iba-1 protein levels. Caspase-3 expression was increased significantly by all the doses of rotenone in MB but in STR only by higher doses (6 and 12 μg). It may be suggested that astroglial activation and apoptosis play an important role in rotenone-induced neurotoxicity. MB appeared as more sensitive than STR toward rotenone-induced cell toxicity. The astroglial cells emerged as more susceptible than neuronal and microglial cells to rotenone in STR.

AB  - Difficulties in realizing persistent neurogenesis, inabilities in modeling pathogenesis of most cases, and a shortage of disease material for screening therapeutic agents restrict our progress to overcome challenges presented by neurodegenerative diseases. We propose that reprogramming primary somatic cells of patients into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provides a new avenue to overcome these impediments. Their abilities in self-renewal and differentiation into various cell types will enable disease investigation and drug development. In this review, we introduce efficient approaches to generate iPSCs and distinct iPSCs differentiation stages, and critically discuss paradigms of iPSCs technology application to investigate neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Huntington’s disease (HD). Although iPSCs technology is in its infancy and faces many obstacles, it has great potential in helping to identify therapeutic targets for treating neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Given the rapid rate of population aging and the increased incidence of cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases with advanced age, it is important to ascertain the determinants that result in cognitive impairment. It is also important to note that much of the aged population exhibit ‘successful’ cognitive aging, in which cognitive impairment is minimal. One main goal of normal aging studies is to distinguish the neural changes that occur in unsuccessful (functionally impaired) subjects from those of successful (functionally unimpaired) subjects. In this review, we present some of the structural adaptations that neurons and spines undergo throughout normal aging and discuss their likely contributions to electrophysiological properties and cognition. Structural changes of neurons and dendritic spines during aging, and the functional consequences of such changes, remain poorly understood. Elucidating the structural and functional synaptic age-related changes that lead to cognitive impairment may lead to the development of drug treatments that can restore or protect neural circuits and mediate cognition and successful aging.

AB  - Global-heterozygous and brain-specific homozygous knockouts (KOs) of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) cause late- and early-onset obesity, respectively, both involving hyperphagia. Little is known about the mechanism underlying this hyperphagia or whether BDNF loss from peripheral tissues could contribute to overeating. Since global-homozygous BDNF-KO is perinatal lethal, a BDNF-KO that spared sufficient brainstem BDNF to support normal health was utilized to begin to address these issues. Meal pattern and microstructure analyses suggested overeating of BDNF-KO mice was mediated by deficits in both satiation and satiety that resulted in increased meal size and frequency and implicated a reduction of vagal signaling from the gut to the brain. Meal-induced c-Fos activation in the nucleus of the solitary tract, a more direct measure of vagal afferent signaling, however, was not decreased in BDNF-KO mice, and thus was not consistent with a vagal afferent role. Interestingly though, meal-induced c-Fos activation was increased in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (DMV) of BDNF-KO mice. This could imply that augmentation of vago-vagal digestive reflexes occurred (e.g., accommodation), which would support increased meal size and possibly increased meal number by reducing the increase in intragastric pressure produced by a given amount of ingesta. Additionally, vagal sensory neuron number in BDNF-KO mice was altered in a manner consistent with the increased meal-induced activation of the DMV. These results suggest reduced BDNF causes satiety and satiation deficits that support hyperphagia, possibly involving augmentation of vago-vagal reflexes mediated by central pathways or vagal afferents regulated by BDNF levels.

AB  - Four-vessel occlusion (4VO), a frequently used model of global cerebral ischemia in rats, results in a dysfunction in wide brain areas, including the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. However, there are pronounced differences in response to global ischemia between the laboratory rat strains used in these studies. In the present work, the immediate acute effects of 4VO-induced global ischemia on the spontaneous electrocorticogram (ECoG) signals were analyzed in Wistar and Sprague–Dawley rats. The ECoG was isoelectric during the 10 min of global cerebral ischemia in Wistar rats and the first burst (FB) was seen 10–13 min after the start of reperfusion. In Sprague–Dawley rats, the FB was detected immediately after the start of 4VO or a few seconds later. The burst suppression ratio (BSR) in Wistar rats decreased to 45% in 5 min after FB, and after 25 min it was approximately 40%. In Sprague–Dawley rats, the BSR was 55% immediately after the FB and it decreased steeply to reach 0% by 10 min. There was also a significant difference between the two strains in the frequency composition of the ECoG pattern. The power spectral densities of the two strains differed virtually throughout the post-ischemic state. The histological results (Evans Blue, Cresyl Violet and Fluoro Jade C stainings) supplemented the electrophysiological data: the neuronal damage in the CA1 pyramids in Wistar rats was severe, whereas in the Sprague–Dawley animals it was only partial. These observations clearly demonstrate that the use of different rat strains (e.g. Wistar vs. Sprague–Dawley) can be a source of considerable variability in the results of acute experiments on global ischemia and it is important that the laboratory rats used in such experiments should be carefully chosen.

AB  - Although trigeminal neuropathic pain is one of the most common chronic pain syndromes, the etiology is still unknown. Here, a rat model was generated using chronic constrictive injury (CCI) with ligation of the infraorbital nerve to test the hypothesis that collapse of chloride homeostasis in trigeminal neurons causes impairment of γ-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) inhibition and induces trigeminal allodynia. Rats showed a reduction and increase in pain threshold and pain response scores, respectively, to mechanical stimulation, 1 and 3 weeks after CCI. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis showed that inward-directed Na+, K+–2Cl− cotransporter (NKCC1) mRNA and protein were upregulated in the small-sized and large-sized primary neurons in the injured side of the trigeminal ganglion and in the peripherin-positive terminal, respectively, for the first 2 weeks, while outward-directed K+–Cl− cotransporter (KCC2) mRNA and protein were downregulated in secondary relay neurons on the injured side of the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Sp5C). Optical imaging of evoked synaptic responses using a voltage-sensitive dye revealed that pre- and post-synaptic GABA actions were disinhibited and excitatory in the injured side, respectively, but inhibited in the sham-operated side of the Sp5C. This downregulation of KCC2 in the Sp5C may result in an excitatory switch by impairing postsynaptic GABA inhibition. GABA-mediated presynaptic disinhibition was attenuated by bumetanide, suggesting that NKCC1 upregulation in primary neurons may facilitate pain transmission by presynaptic GABAergic depolarization. Such Cl− homeostatic disruption resulting in perturbation of the inhibitory system possibly increases pain transmission, which may underlie the pathophysiology of trigeminal neuropathic pain.

AB  - The intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) of the lateral geniculate body in the rat is a population of GABAergic neurons that can be divided into two, anatomically and neurochemically distinct populations. One population comprises neuropeptide-Y (NPY)-positive neurons that form the geniculohypothalamic tract innervating the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and the other population comprises enkephalin-positive (ENK) neurons giving rise to the geniculo-geniculate tract innervating the contralateral IGL (cIGL). Previous electrophysiological studies have observed various patterns of firing and different responses to changes in lighting conditions of IGL neurons in vitro and in vivo. The aim of the present study was to determine if these distinct properties could be ascribed to differentially projecting IGL neurons. Neuron activity was recorded extracellularly in the IGL of anaesthetised rats under different lighting conditions (i.e. light/dark). Antidromic activation was used to identify recorded cells as projecting to the SCN or the contralateral IGL. All IGL neurons identified as projecting to the contralateral IGL displayed infra-slow oscillatory activity (ISO; i.e. slow rhythmic bursts of action potentials). ISO of these neurons was sustained in the light and was diminished in the darkness. In contrast, all IGL neurons identified as projecting to the SCN displayed a low level of firing in the light and a majority of these cells increased firing in the darkness. All IGL neurons projecting to the SCN were characterised by an irregular pattern of firing in the light and dark. These data are the first to demonstrate that differentially projecting rat intergeniculate leaflet neurons are characterised by distinct firing patterns and opposite responses to light and dark conditions.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus has been identified as a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Insulin is a neuroprotective growth factor, and an impairment of insulin signalling has been found in AD brains. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), an incretin hormone, normalises insulin signalling and also acts as a neuroprotective growth factor. GIP plays an important role in memory formation, synaptic plasticity and cell proliferation. We have shown previously that the long-lasting incretin hormone analogue D-Ala2GIP protects memory formation and synaptic plasticity, reduces plaques, normalises the proliferation of stem cells, reduces the activation of microglia, and prevents the loss of synapses in the cortex of the APPswe/PS1deltaE9 mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. D-Ala2GIP was injected for 35 days at 25 nmol/kg i.p. once daily in APP/PS1 male mice and wild-type (WT) littermates aged 6, 12 and 19 months. In a follow-up study, we analysed plaque load, the activation of astrocytes as a means of chronic inflammation in the brain, and oxidative stress in the brains of these mice (8-oxoguanine levels). D-Ala2GIP reduced the amyloid plaque load in 12- and 19-month-old mice, and the inflammation response as shown in the reduction of activated astrocytes in 12- and 19-month old APP/PS1 mice. Chronic oxidative stress in the brain was reduced in 12- and 19-month-old mice as shown in the reduction of 8-oxoguanine levels in the cortex of D-Ala2GIP-injected APP/PS1 mice. The results demonstrate that D-Ala2GIP has neuroprotective properties on key markers found in Alzheimer’s disease. This finding shows that novel GIP analogues have the potential to be developed as novel therapeutics for Alzheimer’s disease.

AB  - Synthesis of H1° histone, in the developing rat brain, is also regulated at post-transcriptional level. Regulation of RNA metabolism depends on a series of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs); therefore, we searched for H1° mRNA-interacting proteins. With this aim, we used in vitro transcribed, biotinylated H1° RNA as bait to isolate, by a chromatographic approach, proteins which interact with this mRNA, in the nuclei of brain cells. Abundant RBPs, such as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K and hnRNP A1, and molecular chaperones (heat shock cognate 70, Hsc70) were identified by mass spectrometry. Western blot analysis also revealed the presence of cold shock domain-containing protein 2 (CSD-C2, also known as PIPPin), a brain-enriched RBP previously described in our laboratory. Co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed to investigate the possibility that identified proteins interact with each other and with other nuclear proteins. We found that hnRNP K interacts with both hnRNP A1 and Hsc70 whereas there is no interaction between hnRNP A1 and Hsc70. Moreover, CSD-C2 interacts with hnRNP A1, Y box-binding protein 1 (YB-1), and hnRNP K. We also have indications that CSD-C2 interacts with Hsc70. Overall, we have contributed to the molecular characterization of a ribonucleoprotein particle possibly controlling H1° histone expression in the brain.

AB  - Cerebral ischemia, traumatic brain injury, intracerebral hemorrhage and other brain insults trigger neurogenesis in the subventricular zone and hippocampal subgranular zone, and newly formed blood vessels promote the migration of these new neuronal cells to damaged brain regions. The molecular steps involved in brain injury-induced angiogenesis and neurogenesis are unclear. Here we used a rat model of collagenase-induced intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) to examine whether matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), a zinc endopeptidase that regulates growth factor levels during recovery from brain injury, is involved in neurogenesis and angiogenesis following ICH. Induction of ICH led to significant increases in the levels of MMP-9, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and nerve growth factor (NGF), as well as in the numbers of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)- and doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells, in the ipsilateral brain. Intracerebroventricular injection of MMP-9 siRNA reduced these ICH-induced increases. These findings suggest that MMP-9 may promote angiogenesis and neurogenesis during recovery from ICH.

AB  - Intracerebral microinjection is a commonly used technique for local delivery of biologically active agents. However, it is known that mechanical injury of the cortex can induce spreading depression (SD), a wave of transient cellular depolarization. We examined the effects of intracortical microinjections of a new selective Ih channel antagonist ORG 34167 and of different control treatments (saline and sham microinjections) on spontaneously occurring spike-wave discharges (SWDs) in WAG/Rij rats, a valid genetic model of absence epilepsy. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recording in awake rats has shown that both the drug and control microinjections are followed by long-term (for more than an hour) suppression of SWDs. dc-EEG recording in WAG/Rij rats has revealed that sham microinjections induce SD in 65% (31/48) cases. Number of SWDs decreased substantially for at least 90 min after the sham injections which induced cortical SD but remained unchanged if SD was not triggered by microinjection. These findings suggest that SD induced by intracortical microinjection may contribute to long-term suppression of non-convulsive epileptic activity after this experimental procedure.

AB  - The naked mole-rat is a subterranean colonial rodent. In each colony, which can grow to as many as 300 individuals, there is only one female and 1–3 males that are reproductive and socially dominant. The remaining animals are reproductively suppressed subordinates that contribute to colony survival through their cooperative behaviors. Oxytocin is a peptide hormone that has shown relatively widespread effects on prosocial behaviors in other species. We examined whether social status affects the number of oxytocin-immunoreactive neurons in the paraventricular nucleus and the supraoptic nucleus by comparing dominant breeding animals to subordinate non-breeding workers from intact colonies. We also examined these regions in subordinate animals that had been removed from their colony and paired with an opposite- or same-sex conspecific for 6 months. Stereological analyses indicated that subordinates had significantly more oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus than breeders. Animals in both opposite- and same-sex pairs showed a decreased oxytocin neuron number compared to subordinates suggesting that status differences may be due to social condition rather than the reproductive activity of the animal per se. The effects of social status appear to be region specific as no group differences were found for oxytocin neuron number in the supraoptic nucleus. Given that subordinate naked mole-rats are kept reproductively suppressed through antagonism by the queen, we speculate that status differences are due either to oxytocin’s anxiolytic properties to combat the stress of this antagonism or to its ability to promote the prosocial behaviors of subordinates.

AB  - Musculoskeletal pain conditions, particularly those associated with temporomandibular disorders (TMD) affect a large percentage of the population. Identifying mechanisms underlying hyperalgesia could contribute to the development of new treatment strategies for the management of TMD and other muscle pain conditions. In this study, we provide evidence of functional interactions between two ligand-gated channels, P2X3 and transient receptor potential V1 (TRPV1), in trigeminal sensory neurons, and propose that the interactions serve as an underlying mechanism for the development of mechanical hyperalgesia. Mechanical sensitivity of the masseter muscle was assessed in lightly anesthetized rats via an electronic anesthesiometer (Ro et al., 2009). Direct intramuscular injection of a selective P2X3 agonist, alpha,beta-methylene adenosine triphosphate (αβmeATP), induced a dose- and time-dependent hyperalgesia. Mechanical sensitivity in the contralateral muscle was unaffected suggesting local P2X3 mediate hyperalgesia. Anesthetizing the overlying skin had no effect on αβmeATP-induced hyperalgesia confirming the contribution of P2X3 from the muscle. Importantly, the αβmeATP-induced hyperalgesia was prevented by pretreatment of the muscle with a TRPV1 antagonist, AMG9810. P2X3 was co-expressed with TRPV1 in the masseter muscle afferents confirming the possibility for intracellular interactions. Additionally, in a subpopulation of P2X3/TRPV1 positive neurons, capsaicin-induced Ca2+ transients were significantly amplified following P2X3 activation. Finally, activation of P2X3 induced phosphorylation of serine, but not threonine, residues in TRPV1 in trigeminal ganglia cultures. Significant phosphorylation was observed at 15 min, the time point at which behavioral hyperalgesia was prominent. Previously, activation of either P2X3 or TRPV1 had been independently implicated in the development of mechanical hyperalgesia. Our data propose P2X3 and TRPV1 interact in a facilitatory manner, which could contribute to the peripheral sensitization known to underlie masseter hyperalgesia.

AB  - This is the first controlled study demonstrating the beneficial effects of transcranial laser stimulation on cognitive and emotional functions in humans. Photobiomodulation with red to near-infrared light is a novel intervention shown to regulate neuronal function in cell cultures, animal models, and clinical conditions. Light that intersects with the absorption spectrum of cytochrome oxidase was applied to the forehead of healthy volunteers using the laser diode CG-5000, which maximizes tissue penetration and has been used in humans for other indications. We tested whether low-level laser stimulation produces beneficial effects on frontal cortex measures of attention, memory and mood. Reaction time in a sustained-attention psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) was significantly improved in the treated (n = 20) vs. placebo control (n = 20) groups, especially in high novelty-seeking subjects. Performance in a delayed match-to-sample (DMS) memory task showed also a significant improvement in treated vs. control groups as measured by memory retrieval latency and number of correct trials. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS-X), which tracks self-reported positive and negative affective (emotional) states over time, was administered immediately before treatment and 2 weeks after treatment. The PANAS showed that while participants generally reported more positive affective states than negative, overall affect improved significantly in the treated group due to more sustained positive emotional states as compared to the placebo control group. These data imply that transcranial laser stimulation could be used as a non-invasive and efficacious approach to increase brain functions such as those related to cognitive and emotional dimensions. Transcranial infrared laser stimulation has also been proven to be safe and successful at improving neurological outcome in humans in controlled clinical trials of stroke. This innovative approach could lead to the development of non-invasive, performance-enhancing interventions in healthy humans and in those in need of neuropsychological rehabilitation.

AB  - Oxidative stress is a common harmful condition of several neurodegenerative diseases. Antioxidants represent the medical choice strategy for protection against this unbalanced oxidant–antioxidant status. The present study was undertaken to address the role of kaurane diterpenes foliol, linearol and sidol in the protection against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in the human astrocytoma U373-MG cell line and to establish the underlying mechanisms. U373-MG cells were pretreated with diterpenes (5 and 10 μM, 24 h) prior to H2O2 exposition (1 mM, 30 min). We found that linearol and sidol exerted a significant astroprotective action, and foliol was the least active one. Linearol and sidol especially increased cell viability as shown by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide and lactate dehydrogenase assay and attenuated morphological changes of U373-MG cells induced by H2O2. Moreover, these compounds significantly decreased the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species, counteracted glutathione/oxidized glutathione changes, reduced lipid peroxidation and restored antioxidant and protein expression of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase and hemooxigenase-1). Furthermore, these natural products increased Nrf2 nuclear levels, suggesting the activation of this master regulator of antioxidative gene expressions in the protective effect exhibited by the kaurane diterpenes studied. Collectively, these results suggest that the studied kaurane diterpenes, mainly linearol and sidol, protect U373-MG cells from H2O2-induced injury or degeneration presumably by antioxidant mechanisms. These compounds may be useful agents for counteracting the oxidative damage occurring during the pathological development of several CNS disorders.

AB  - Several lines of evidence have converged to indicate that memory formation involves plasticity of dendritic spines in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus. Memory varies with estrogen levels throughout the lifespan of the female. Generally, increased levels of estrogen are related to greater dendritic spine density on pyramidal cells in the PFC and the hippocampus and to improved memory function. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a growth factor which increases dendritic spines and enhances memory function. Estrogens increase BDNF levels in the PFC and the hippocampus. In the present review we provide evidence that estradiol and BDNF may work in concert to enhance cognition. In adult females, fluctuations in recognition memory following ovariectomy and estradiol replacement, during the estrous cycle, in pregnancy and with aging are accompanied by similar changes in circulating estradiol, BDNF levels and spine density alterations in the PFC and the hippocampus. In addition, both estradiol and BDNF induce spine plasticity via rapid membrane effects and slower transcriptional regulation via the CREB pathway. Moreover, estradiol increases BDNF levels through action on nuclear receptors. While the exact mechanism(s) for the influence of estrogens and BDNF on memory remain unclear, this combination may provide the basis for new and more effective strategies for treating age-related and neurodegenerative memory loss.

AB  - Brain development is sensitive to an individual’s interaction with its environment. Deprivation of natural environmental stimulation especially in the phase after weaning has long-lasting consequences on neuroplasticity. However, previous findings concerning the effects of rearing environment on adult hippocampal cell proliferation and neurogenesis in rodents remain contradictory.

To address the question, whether the variability of hippocampal plasticity in response to environmental conditions is a unique feature at least in mice, the present study examined the effects of social and physical deprivation during brain development on hippocampal cell production and survival in adults of three mouse strains (Mus musculus) with different domestication background: outbred CD1, inbred C57Bl/6 and the F2-descendants of wild-caught house mice.

Wheel running increased cell proliferation rates in the dentate gyrus of CD 1 and C57Bl/6 mice reared under socially and physically deprived conditions, but not from enriched conditions. In wild house mice, neither the rearing conditions nor the wheel-running challenge did affect proliferative activity.

This indicates, on the one hand, that wild house mice are more robust in their regulation of hippocampal cell proliferation against environmental influences and, on the other hand, that domestication and rearing background of laboratory animals impact neuroplastic potentials and responsiveness to external stimuli in adulthood.

AB  - Spumiform basement membrane degeneration (sbmd) is a specific kind of aberration present in the capillaries of the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) region of the senescent hamster. These capillaries, separated by the ependymal cell layer, are bordering the Sylvian cerebral aqueduct. The aqueduct, connecting the 3rd and 4th ventricle, may be crucial for local homeostatic as well as general autonomic functions of the PAG. Local pressure effects of the flowing and pulsating cerebrospinal fluid on the PAG-vasculature are probably different for the rostral ‘entrance’ and the caudal ‘exit’ of the aqueduct.

In view of the different functions of the various divisions of the PAG, the frequency and extent of the aberrations in the rostral, intermediate and caudal dl/vlPAG-microvasculature could shed some light on the causal factors involved in the regional distribution of the particular microvascular aberrations found in the PAG during aging. In the present study we investigated the ultrastructure of capillaries in dorsal and ventral subdivisions of anterior and posterior regions of the PAG of young and old female Syrian hamsters. Sbmds were classified into four stages of spumiform severity and for each stage the frequency was determined in the rostral PAG, at two levels in the intermediate PAG and in a dorsal and a ventral part of the caudal PAG.

Results of our quantitative studies showed that in aged hamster PAG various stages of sbmd were present in 91.6 ± 0.6% of all capillaries. No clear evidence was found for regional differentiation between rostral, intermediate and caudal parts of the PAG. Next to sbmd, capillary split basement membrane (sbm) and vacuolization were common features at all five PAG locations. 84.3 ± 2.3% of all screened PAG capillaries displayed sbm. In agreement with our previous findings, several other types of microvascular aberrations were observed in addition to general aspects of aging and some ependymal structural peculiarities.

We conclude that the presence of various forms of sbmds in the PAG of senescent hamsters is a phenomenon that appears to be specific to the PAG region, but causal factors for this type of capillary degeneration remain unclear. Sbmds in the PAG may have serious consequences not only for blood–brain barrier functioning, but also for vascular perfusion and blood supply with eventually serious consequences for adequate regulation of the autonomic and motor control functions of the PAG region.

AB  - The developmental anatomy of the brain is largely directed by neural-based cues. Despite this knowledge, the developmental trajectory of the primate brain has not yet been fully characterized. To realize this goal, the advance in noninvasive imaging methods and new brain atlases are essential. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate, is widely used in neuroscience research. The recent introduction of transgenic techniques has enabled the marmoset to be used as a genetically modifiable primate model for brain development. Here, a magnetic resonance histology technique involving the use of ultra-high-resolution ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to identify the developmental anatomy of the marmoset brain at different time points from gestational week 8 through to birth. The data allowed the generation of a multidimensional atlas of brain structures at different developmental stages. Furthermore, in utero MRI techniques were developed to noninvasively monitor brain development during the embryonic and fetal stages. The multidimensional atlas and the MRI tools developed herein are anticipated to further our understanding of the developing primate brain.

AB  - Brimonidine, an alpha2-adrenergic receptor (α2-AR) agonist, is thought to be neuroprotective in some types of neurons via the activation of α2-AR. However, it is still unknown whether the α2-ARs exist in cochlear spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). The authors aimed to demonstrate the presence and localization of α2-ARs in rat-cultured SGNs and to investigate the effect of brimonidine on glutamate- and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced damage in the primary-cultured rat SGNs. The expression of α2-ARs was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. Then SGNs were exposed to glutamate or H2O2 respectively with or without brimonidine. Cell viability was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. Apoptosis was determined by acridine orange and Hoechst 33342/propidium iodide double staining. The protein expressions of α2-ARs, Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-9, Caspase-3, p-ERK1/2, iNOS, and artemin were determined by Western blot respectively. The cell viability was markedly reduced after exposure of glutamate (1 mM) or H2O2 (300 μM) to SGNs. Treatment with brimonidine protected SGNs against glutamate- or H2O2-induced cell damage, enhanced SGNs survival, decreased the elevation of Bax, Caspase-9, Caspase-3, p-ERK1/2, and artemin triggered by glutamate or H2O2, and altered the expressions of Bcl-2 and iNOS. These protective effects of brimonidine can be reversed by yohimbine. Overall, the study describes the localization of α2-ARs in rat-cultured SGNs and indicates that brimonidine, which may work directly via interaction with α2-ARs, attenuates glutamate- and H2O2-induced damage in SGNs by Caspase-dependent modes as well as Caspase-independent modes.

AB  - The incidence of anxiety, mood, substance abuse disorders and schizophrenia increases during adolescence. Epidemiological evidence confirms that exposure to stress during sensitive periods of development can create vulnerabilities that put genetically predisposed individuals at increased risk for psychiatric disorders. Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) is a frequently identified schizophrenia susceptibility gene that has also been associated with the psychotic features of bipolar disorder. Previously, we established that Type II NRG1 is expressed in the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis neurocircuitry. We also found, using a line of Nrg1 hypomorphic rats (Nrg1Tn), that genetic disruption of Type II NRG1 results in altered HPA axis function and environmental reactivity. The present studies used the Nrg1Tn rats to test whether Type II NRG1 gene disruption and chronic stress exposure during adolescence interact to alter adult anxiety- and fear-related behaviors. Male and female Nrg1Tn and wild-type rats were exposed to chronic variable stress (CVS) during mid-adolescence and then tested for anxiety-like behavior, cued fear conditioning and basal corticosterone secretion in adulthood. The disruption of Type II NRG1 alone significantly impacts rat anxiety-related behavior by reversing normal sex-related differences and impairs the ability to acquire cued fear conditioning. Sex-specific interactions between genotype and adolescent stress also were identified such that CVS-treated wild-type females exhibited a slight reduction in anxiety-like behavior and basal corticosterone, while CVS-treated Nrg1Tn females exhibited a significant increase in cued fear extinction. These studies confirm the importance of Type II NRG1 in anxiety and fear behaviors and point to adolescence as a time when stressful experiences can shape adult behavior and HPA axis function.

AB  - Approximately 50% of patients with a major depressive episode fail to achieve remission with first-line antidepressant treatments. Second-line treatment strategies for such patients include lithium augmentation of antidepressants, particularly with tricyclic antidepressants. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of lithium augmentation are not yet fully understood. Unravelling these mechanisms could aid the development of more effective antidepressant drugs. In the present study, we investigated whether chronic treatment with a combination of lithium and the tricyclic antidepressant, desipramine, could produce antidepressant-like behaviour in a mouse strain (BALB/cOLaHsd) that exhibited reduced sensitivity to the behavioural effects of chronic desipramine treatment in the novelty-induced hypophagia test. Since chronic treatment with antidepressant drugs increases the proliferation of newly-born cells in the hippocampus, and hippocampal cell proliferation is required for the behavioural effects of at least some antidepressants in neohypophagia tests, the present study also investigated whether lithium plus desipramine increased cell proliferation in the hippocampus. Chronic treatment with lithium plus desipramine but neither drug alone, induced antidepressant-like behaviour and increased hippocampal cell proliferation, thus suggesting that increased hippocampal cell proliferation may be a mechanism underlying lithium augmentation of antidepressants. Moreover, since BALB/cOLaHsd mice respond to lithium plus desipramine but not to either drug alone, they may become useful in the development of a mouse model of treatment-refractory depression for which there is an unmet need.

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has multiple roles in the central nervous system (CNS), including maintaining cell survival and regulation of synaptic function. In CNS neurons, BDNF triggers activation of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways, influencing neuronal cells beneficially through these intracellular signaling cascades. There is evidence to suggest that decreased BDNF expression or function is related to the pathophysiology of brain diseases including psychiatric disorders. Additionally, glucocorticoids, which are critical stress hormones, also influence neuronal function in the CNS, and are putatively involved in the onset of depression when levels are abnormally high. In animal models of depression, changes in glucocorticoid levels, expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and alterations in BDNF signaling are observed. Interestingly, several studies using in vivo and in vitro systems suggest that glucocorticoids interact with BDNF to ultimately affect CNS function. In the present review, we provide an overview of recent evidence concerning the interaction between BDNF and glucocorticoids.

AB  - The role of 5-HT2A/2B/2C receptors in formalin-induced secondary allodynia and hyperalgesia in rats was assessed. Formalin produced acute nociceptive behaviors (flinching and licking/lifting) followed by long-term secondary mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia. Pre-treatment for five consecutive days with compound 48/80 (1, 3, 10, 10, and 10 μg/paw) prevented formalin-induced secondary allodynia and hyperalgesia. Ipsilateral, but not contralateral, peripheral pre-treatment (nmol/paw) with the 5-HT2 receptor agonist DOI (3-30), 5-HT (10-100) or fluoxetine (0.3-3) significantly increased 0.5% formalin-induced secondary allodynia and hyperalgesia in both paws. The pronociceptive effect of DOI (10 nmol/paw), 5-HT (100 nmol/paw) and fluoxetine (1 nmol/paw) was blocked by selective 5-HT2A (ketanserin), 5-HT2B (RS-127445), and 5-HT2C (RS-102221) receptor antagonists. Furthermore, ipsilateral pre-treatment (nmol/paw) with ketanserin (1, 10, and 100), RS-127445 (0.01, 0.1 and 1) or RS-102221 (1, 10 and 100) prevented while post-treatment reversed 1% formalin-induced secondary allodynia and hyperalgesia in both paws. In marked contrast, contralateral injection of the greatest tested dose of 5-HT2A/2B/2C receptor antagonists did not modify long-lasting secondary allodynia and hyperalgesia. These results suggest that 5-HT released from mast cells after formalin injection sensitizes primary afferent neurons via 5-HT2A/2B/2C receptors leading to the development and maintenance of secondary allodynia and hyperalgesia.

AB  - This review aims to characterize fatigue-related changes in corticospinal excitability and inhibition in healthy subjects. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been extensively used in recent years to investigate modifications within the brain during and after fatiguing exercise. Single-pulse TMS reveals reduction in motor-evoked potentials (MEP) when measured in relaxed muscle following sustained fatiguing contractions. This modulation of corticospinal excitability observed in relaxed muscle is probably not specific to the fatigue induced by the motor task. During maximal and submaximal fatiguing contractions, voluntary activation measured by TMS decreases, suggesting the presence of supraspinal fatigue. The demonstration of supraspinal fatigue does not eliminate the possibility of spinal contribution to central fatigue. Concomitant measurement of TMS-induced MEP and cervicomedullary MEP in the contracting muscle, appropriately normalized to maximal muscle compound action potential, is necessary to determine the relative contribution of cortical and spinal mechanisms in the development of central fatigue. Recent studies comparing electromyographic (EMG) responses to paired-pulse stimuli at the cortical and subcortical levels suggest that impaired motoneuron responsiveness rather than intracortical inhibition may contribute to the development of central fatigue. This review examines the mechanical and EMG responses elicited by TMS (single- and paired-pulse) and cervicomedullary stimulation both during and after a fatiguing exercise. Particular attention is given to the muscle state and the type of fatiguing exercise when assessing and interpreting fatigue-induced changes in these parameters. Methodological concerns and future research interests are also considered.

KW  - retrograde neuronal tracing
AB  - Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) influence bladder afferent activity and reflex sensitivity, and have been suggested as potential targets for treating detrusor overactivity. Mechanisms may include indirect effects, e.g. involving the urothelium, and direct action on nAChR expressed by afferent neurons. Here we determined the nAChR repertoire of bladder afferent neurons by retrograde neuronal tracing and laser-assisted microdissection/reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR), and quantified retrogradely labelled nAChRα3-subunit-expressing neurons by immunohistochemistry in nAChR α3β4α5 cluster enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) reporter mice. Bladder afferents distinctly expressed mRNAs encoding for nAChR-subunits α3, α6, α7, β2–4, and weakly α4. Based upon known combinatorial patterns of subunits, this predicts the expression of at least three basically different subunits of nAChR – α3∗, α6∗ and α7∗ – and of additional combinations with β-subunits and α5. Bladder afferents were of all sizes, and their majority (69%; n = 1367) were eGFP–nAChRα3 positive. Immunofluorescence revealed immunoreactivities to neurofilament 68 (NF68), transient receptor potential cation channel vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in eGFP–nAChRα3-positive and -negative neurons. For each antigen, all possible combinations of colocalisation with eGFP–nAChRα3 were observed, with eGFP–nAChRα3-positive bladder neurons without additional immunoreactivity being most numerous, followed by triple-labelled neurons. In conclusion, more than one population of bladder afferent neurons expresses nAChR, indicating that peripheral nicotinic initiation and modulation of bladder reflexes might result, in addition to indirect effects, from the direct activation of sensory terminals. The expression of multiple nAChR subunits offers the potential of selectively addressing functional aspects and/or sensory neuron subpopulations.

AB  - Nicotine is known to have enhancing effects on some aspects of attention and cognition. As for the pre-attentive processes of detecting sensory changes, nicotine has significant effects on the auditory and visual systems implying that its pre-attentive effect is common among sensory modalities. The purpose of the present study was to elucidate whether acute nicotine administration has enhancing effects in the somatosensory system. Change-related cortical activity in response to an abrupt increase in stimulus intensity was recorded using magnetoencephalography. The test stimulus consisted of standard electrical pulses at 100 Hz for 500 ms applied to the dorsum of the left hand followed by 0.7-mA stronger pulses for 300 ms. Nicotine was administered in a gum (4 mg of nicotine). Eleven healthy nonsmokers were tested with a double-blind and placebo-controlled design. Effects of nicotine on the cortical response in the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortices were investigated. Results showed that nicotine failed to affect the S1 response while it significantly increased the amplitude of S2 activity in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the stimulation, and shortened the peak latency of S2 activity in both hemispheres. Since cortical responses in the present study represent a pre-attentive automatic process to encode new somatosensory events, the results suggest that nicotine can exert beneficial cognitive effects without a direct impact on attention and that the effect of nicotine on the automatic change-detecting system is common across sensory modalities.

AB  - Quinolinic acid (QA)-induced overactivation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors yields excitotoxicity, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, which altogether contribute to trigger a wide variety of toxic pathways with biochemical, behavioral and neuropathological alterations similar to those observed in Huntington’s disease. Noteworthy, in the brains of these patients, increased expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) levels can be found. It has been proposed that this enzyme can exert a dual role, as it can be either protective or deleterious to the CNS. While some evidence indicates that its overexpression affords cellular anti-oxidant protection due to decreased concentrations of its pro-oxidative substrate heme group, and increased bilirubin levels, other reports established that high HO-1 expression and activity may result in a pro-oxidizing atmosphere due to a release of Fe2+. In this work, we examined the temporal evolution of oxidative damage to proteins, HO-1 expression, immunoreactivity, total activity, and cell death after 1, 3, 5 and 7 days of an intrastriatal QA infusion (240 nmol/μl). QA was found to induce cellular degeneration, increasing carbonylated proteins and generating a transitory response in HO-1 mRNA, protein content, and immunoreactivity and activity in nerve cells. In order to study the role of HO-1 in the QA-induced cellular death, the tin protoporphyrin IX (SnPP), a well-known HO inhibitor, was administered to rats (30 μmol/kg, i.p.). The administration of SnPP to animals treated with QA inhibited the HO activation, and exacerbated the striatal cell damage induced by QA. Our findings reveal a potential modulatory role of HO-1 in the toxic paradigm evoked by QA in rats. This evidence provides a valuable tool for further approaches on HO-1 regulation in neurotoxic paradigms.

AB  - Fibronectin type III domain-containing 5 protein (Fndc5) or peroxisomal protein, is a type I membrane protein that has 209 amino acid residues. Previous studies by our group have shown an increase in its expression after retinoic acid treatment of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) during the process of neural differentiation, leading us to conclude that it might be involved in neurogenesis. In the present study, we have constructed an inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA) vector that is expressed under induction by doxycycline. Next, we generated a stably transformed mESCs line that expressed shRNA against the Fndc5 gene. The knockdown of Fndc5 was performed in two stages of mESC neural differentiation during and post-neural progenitor (NP) formation. Our results indicated that in the process of NPs formation, decreased Fndc5 expression significantly reduced expression of NPs and mature neuronal markers which modulated neuronal differentiation. Decreased Fndc5 expression during the post-NPs formation stage also caused significant reduction in the levels of mature neuronal markers. Fndc5 knockdown during both stages significantly affected both neuronal and astrocytes maturation. We have concluded that Fndc5 expression is required for the appropriate neural differentiation of mESCs. These data confirm the importance of Fndc5 in the generation and development of the nervous system.

AB  - The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) type of glutamate receptors is involved in synaptic plasticity in hippocampal mossy fibre-CA3 pyramidal neuron synapses. The ultrastructural localization of NMDA receptor subunits at this synapse type is not known. By postembedding electron microscopic immunogold cytochemistry we show that the NMDA receptor subunits GluN1, GluN2A, GluN2B, GluN2C and GluN2D are located in postsynaptic membranes of mossy fibre as well as CA3 recurrent associational commissural synapses. In the mossy fibres the GluN1, GluN2B and GluN2D labelling patterns suggested that these subunits were located also presynaptically in nerve terminal membranes and in mossy fibre axons. GluN3B was predominantly present in mossy fibre synapses as compared to recurrent associational commissural synapses, showing a presynaptic labelling pattern. In conclusion, while the postsynaptic localization of GluN1, GluN2A, GluN2B, and GluN2D is in good agreement with the recent finding of NMDA receptor-dependent long term potentiation (LTP) at CA3 mossy fibre synapses, we propose that presynaptic GluN1, GluN2B, GluN2D and GluN3B subunits could be involved in plastic phenomena such as certain types of LTP and recurrent mossy fibre growth.

AB  - Vascular dementia (VD), defined as a loss of memory and cognitive function resulting from vascular lesions in the brain, is the second-most-common cause of dementia in the elderly, after Alzheimer’s disease. In recent years, research has focused on the pathogenesis of VD, and mitochondrial bioenergetic deficits have been suggested to contribute to VD onset. To further investigate the role of mitochondria in VD, we used a rat model of VD, which involved permanent bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries (with a 1-week interval between artery occlusion to avoid an abrupt reduction in cerebral blood flow) leading to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Prior to occlusion, male Wistar rats underwent 7 days of Morris water maze training. Only animals that could swim and passed the Morris water maze test were chosen for the study. After 5 days of Morris water maze training, mitochondria from the hippocampi of rats, which were randomly selected from animals that could complete the Morris water maze test, were isolated for functional assessment.

Mitochondria isolated from the hippocampi of rats from the ischemia group had decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase protein levels, and increased oxidative stress, as manifested by increased hydrogen peroxide production. The ischemia group mitochondria also exhibited decreased respiration coupled to decreased expression and activity of the electron transport chain complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase). These results indicate that the mitochondrial oxidative metabolism is inhibited in the hippocampi of rats following chronic ischemia-induced VD. As the mitochondrial oxidative metabolism deficits, namely mitochondrial bioenergetic deficits directly affect the functions of neurons, it may contribute to VD onset.

The maintenance and regulation of these synaptic proteins is regulated, in part, by local mRNA translation in dendrites. Protein synthesis within the postsynaptic compartment allows neurons tight spatial and temporal control of synaptic protein expression, which is critical for proper functioning of synapses and neural circuits. In this review, we discuss the identity of proteins synthesized within dendrites, the receptor-mediated mechanisms regulating their synthesis, and the possible roles for these locally synthesized proteins. We also explore how our current understanding of dendritic protein synthesis in the hippocampus can be applied to new brain regions and to understanding the pathological mechanisms underlying varied neurological diseases.

AB  - Neuropathy is often seen in uncontrolled diabetes and the mechanisms involved for neuropathic pain are poorly understood. Hyperglycemia is a consequence of chronic uncontrolled diabetes and it is postulated to produce neuropathic pain. Therefore, in this study, we have investigated the effects of hyperglycemia on Na+ channel kinetics in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from neonatal rats using whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Hyperglycemia-induced increase in density of tetrodotoxin resistant (TTXr) Na+ currents was increased in time- and concentration-dependent manner. The increase was maximal with 60 mM and 24 h. There was no change Na+ current density in time-matched control neurons. The conductance curve of TTXr Na+ current shifted leftward after 24 h exposure to 45 mM glucose. Carbamazepine (CBZ, 100 μM) depressed TTXr Na+ current in neurons incubated with control (17.26), 45 and 60 mM of glucose. The depression observed with CBZ in the presence of high glucose, i.e., 45 mM (86.5 ± 4.9%) was significantly greater than control (61.6 ± 1.8%). Hyperglycemia also increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity and was attenuated by CBZ. These results suggest that short-term exposure of DRG neurons to high glucose concentrations enhance the Na+ channel activity, and were attenuated by CBZ via ROS-dependent mechanisms.

Here we investigated the effects of adrenal corticoids on microglial activation following acute stress. We compared microglial activation in vivo in adrenalectomized (ADX), Sham-operated (SHM), and adrenalectomy plus corticosterone (CORT) administered rats exposed to a 2-h period of acute water restraint stress. We found that: (1) acute stress induced microglial activation in SHM rats; (2) acute stress robustly enhanced microglial activation in ADX rats; (3) CORT treatment significantly reduced the effects of adrenalectomy. Thus, while acute stress has the ability to activate microglia, the magnitude of activation is negatively regulated by CORT. Glucocorticoids may serve as an important endogenous suppressive signal limiting neuroinflammation that might otherwise occur during stress.

AB  - Morphine derived from Papaver somniferum is commonly used as an analgesic compound for pain relief. It is now accepted that endogenous morphine, structurally identical to vegetal morphine–alkaloid, is synthesized by mammalian cells from dopamine. Morphine binds mu opioid receptor and induces antinociceptive effects. However, the exact role of these compounds is a matter of debate although different links with infection, sepsis, inflammation, as well as major neurological pathologies (Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia) have been proposed. The present review describes endogenous morphine and morphine derivative discovery, synthesis, localization and potential implications in physiological and pathological processes.

The expression of GRN mRNA was increased in association with neuroinflammation after TBI. Double-immunohistochemical study showed that PGRN-immunoreactive (-IR) cells were mainly overlapped with CD68-IR cells, suggesting that the main source of PGRN was CD68-positive activated microglia. To investigate the role of PGRN in inflammatory responses related to activated microglia, we compared the immunoreactivity and expression of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1), CD68, and CD11b as markers for activated microglia between wild-type (WT) and GRN-deficient (KO) mice. The number of Iba1- and CD11b-IR cells and gene expression of Iba1 and CD11b were not significantly different between WT and KO mice, while the number of CD68-IR cells and CD68 expression in KO mice were significantly greater than those in WT mice. Double-immunohistochemical study showed that CD68-IR microglia were also IR for TGFβ1, and TGFβ1 expression and Smad3 phosphorylation in KO mice were elevated compared to WT mice. Moreover, double-immunostaining between phospho-Smad3 and glial fibrillary acidic protein suggested increased TGFβ1–Smad3 signal mainly by astrocytes. The levels of protein carbonyl groups, which reflect protein oxidation, and laminin immunoreactivity, which is associated with angiogenesis, were also significantly increased in KO mice compared to WT mice. These results suggest that PGRN is produced in CD68-positive microglia and suppresses excessive inflammatory responses related to activated microglia after TBI in mice.

AB  - Dorsal horn neurons send ascending projections to both thalamic nuclei and parabrachial nuclei; these pathways are thought to be critical pathways for central processing of nociceptive information. Afferents from the corneal surface of the eye mediate nociception from this tissue which is susceptible to clinically important pain syndromes. This study examined corneal afferents to the trigeminal dorsal horn and compared inputs to thalamic- and parabrachial-projecting neurons. We used anterograde tracing with cholera toxin B subunit to identify corneal afferent projections to trigeminal dorsal horn, and the retrograde tracer FluoroGold to identify projection neurons. Studies were conducted in adult male Sprague–Dawley rats. Our analysis was conducted at two distinct levels of the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Vc) which receive corneal afferent projections. We found that corneal afferents project more densely to the rostral pole of Vc than the caudal pole. We also quantified the number of thalamic- and parabrachial-projecting neurons in the regions of Vc that receive corneal afferents. Corneal afferent inputs to both groups of projection neurons were also more abundant in the rostral pole of Vc. Finally, by comparing the frequency of corneal afferent appositions to thalamic- versus parabrachial-projecting neurons, we found that corneal afferents preferentially target parabrachial-projecting neurons in trigeminal dorsal horn. These results suggest that nociceptive pain from the cornea may be primarily mediated by a non-thalamic ascending pathway.

AB  - The elderly have comparatively worse cognitive impairments from traumatic brain injury (TBI) relative to younger adults, but the molecular mechanisms that underlie this exacerbation of cognitive deficits are unknown. Experimental models of TBI have demonstrated that the cyclic AMP-protein kinase A (cAMP-PKA) signaling pathway is downregulated after brain trauma. Since the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway is a key mediator of long-term memory formation, we investigated whether the TBI-induced decrease in cAMP levels is exacerbated in aged animals. Aged (19 months) and young adult (3 months) male Fischer 344 rats received sham surgery or mild (1.4–1.6 atmospheres, atm) or moderate (1.7–2.1 atm) parasagittal fluid-percussion brain injury. At various time points after surgery, the ipsilateral parietal cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus were assayed for cAMP levels. Mild TBI lowered cAMP levels in the hippocampus of aged, but not young adult animals. Moderate TBI lowered cAMP levels in the hippocampus and parietal cortex of both age groups. In the thalamus, cAMP levels were significantly lowered after moderate, but not mild TBI. To determine if the TBI-induced decreases in cAMP had physiological consequences in aged animals, hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in the Schaffer collateral pathway of the CA1 region was assessed. LTP was significantly decreased in both young adult and aged animals after mild and moderate TBI as compared to sham surgery animals. Rolipram rescued the LTP deficits after mild TBI for young adult animals and caused a partial recovery for aged animals. However, rolipram did not rescue LTP deficits after moderate TBI in either young adult or aged animals. These results indicate that the exacerbation of cognitive impairments in aged animals with TBI may be due to decreased cAMP levels and deficits in hippocampal LTP.

AB  - Progesterone has been shown to exert pleiotropic actions in the brain of both male and females. In particular, after traumatic brain injury (TBI), progesterone has important neuroprotective effects. In addition to intracellular progesterone receptors, membrane receptors of the hormone such as membrane progesterone receptor (mPR) may also be involved in neuroprotection. Three mPR subtypes (mPRα, mPRβ, and mPRγ) have been described and mPRα is best characterized pharmacologically. In the present study we investigated the distribution, cellular localization and the regulation of mPRα in male mouse and rat brain. We showed by reverse transcription-PCR that mPRα is expressed at similar levels in the male and female mouse brain suggesting that its expression may not be influenced by steroid levels. Treatment of males by estradiol or progesterone did not modify the level of expression of mPRα as shown by Western blot analysis. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry analysis showed a wide expression of mPRα in particular in the olfactory bulb, striatum, cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, septum, hippocampus and cerebellum. Double immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy analysis showed that mPRα is expressed by neurons but not by oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. In the rat brain, the distribution of mPRα was similar to that observed in mouse brain; and after TBI, mPRα expression was induced in oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and reactive microglia. The wide neuroanatomical distribution of mPRα suggests that this receptor may play a role beyond neuroendocrine and reproductive functions. However, in the absence of injury its role might be restricted to neurons. The induction of mPRα after TBI in microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, points to a potential role in mediating the modulatory effects of progesterone in inflammation, ion and water homeostasis and myelin repair in the injured brain.

AB  - Heroin is reported to cause spongiform leukoencephalopathy (SLE) in heroin addicts and the exact mechanism has not yet been identified. In the present study, we found that heroin could induce apoptosis of primary cultured cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) and Bim was upregulated both transcriptionally and post transcriptionally during CGCs apoptosis. Upregulated Bim translocated to mitochondria and Bax was activated under heroin treatment. Genetic knockdown of Bim using lentiviruses significantly prevented neuronal apoptosis induced by heroin. Meanwhile, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun pathway was activated in heroin-induced apoptosis. Bim was demonstrated as a downstream target of JNK/c-Jun pathway in this process because pharmacological inhibition of JNK reduced the levels of Bim mRNA and protein. These results indicate that Bim plays a critical role in the neurotoxic process by heroin and JNK/c-Jun pathway acts upstream of Bim in regulating heroin-induced neuronal death. This represents a detailed mechanism of heroin-induced neuronal apoptosis and may provide a new and effective strategy to treat heroin-induced addiction and SLE.

AB  - Speech recognition in a multi-talker situation poses high demands on attentional and other central resources. This study examines the relationship between age, cognition and speech recognition in tasks that require selective or divided attention in a multi-talker setting. Two groups of normal-hearing adults (one younger and one older group) were asked to repeat utterances from either one or two concurrent speakers. Cognitive abilities were then inspected by neuropsychological tests.

Speech recognition scores approached its ceiling and did not significantly differ between age groups for tasks that demanded selective attention. However, when divided attention was required, performance in older listeners was reduced as compared to the younger group. When selective attention was required, speech recognition was strongly related to working memory skills, as determined by a regression model. In comparison, speech recognition for tests requiring divided attention could be more strongly determined by neuropsychological probes of fluid intelligence. The findings of this study indicate that – apart from hearing impairment – cognitive aspects account for the typical difficulties of older listeners in a multi-speaker setting. Our results are discussed in the context of evidence showing that frontal lobe functions in terms of working memory and fluid intelligence generally decline with age.

AB  - Chronic stress is known to modulate cannabinoid CB1 receptor binding densities in corticolimbic structures, in a region-dependent manner; however, the ontogeny of these changes and the degree to which they recover following exposure to stress have yet to be determined. To this extent, we examined both the immediate and sustained effects (following a 40-day recovery period) of a repeated restraint stress paradigm (30-min restraint/day for 10 days) on CB1 receptor binding in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus and amygdala in both adolescent (stress onset at post-natal day [PND] 35) and adult (stress onset at PND 75) male Sprague–Dawley rats. Consistent with previous reports, we found that repeated stress in adult rats resulted in an increase in CB1 receptor binding in the PFC, a reduction in CB1 receptor binding in the hippocampus and no effect in the amygdala. Interestingly, adolescent rats exposed to repeated restraint stress did not show any change in hippocampal CB1 receptor density, but exhibited an upregulation of CB1 receptor binding in both the PFC and amygdala. In adults, a 40-day recovery period resulted in a normalization of CB1 receptor binding in the PFC, and surprisingly a pronounced upregulation of CB1 receptor binding in the hippocampus, possibly indicative of a rebound effect. Adolescents similarly exhibited this rebound increase in hippocampal CB1 receptor binding, despite a lack in immediate downregulation following repeated restraint. Of particular interest, adolescents exposed to stress were found to have a sustained downregulation of prefrontocortical CB1 receptors in adulthood, which may relate to some of the reported sustained behavioral effects of stress in adolescence. Collectively, these data indicate that the effects of chronic stress on cannabinoid CB1 receptor binding are modulated by the age of stress exposure and period of recovery following the cessation of stress.

AB  - The neurotrophin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), is recognized as a key component in the regulation of CNS ontogeny, homeostasis and adult neuroplasticity. The importance of BDNF in CNS development and function is well documented by numerous reports from animal studies linking abnormal BDNF signaling to metabolic disturbances and anxiety or depressive-like behavior. Despite the diverse roles for BDNF in nearly all aspects of CNS physiology, the regulation of BDNF expression, as well as our understanding of the signaling mechanisms associated with this neurotrophin, remains incomplete. However, links between sex hormones such as estradiol and testosterone, as well as endogenous and synthetic glucocorticoids (GCs), have emerged as important mediators of BDNF expression and function. Examples of such regulation include brain region-specific induction of Bdnf mRNA in response to estradiol. Additional studies have also documented regulation of the expression of the high-affinity BDNF receptor Tropomyosin-Related Kinase B by estradiol, thus implicating sex steroids not only in the regulation of BDNF expression, but also in mechanisms of signaling associated with it. In addition to gonadal steroids, further evidence also suggests functional interaction between BDNF and GCs, such as in the regulation of corticotrophin-releasing hormone and other important neuropeptides. In this review, we provide an overview of the roles played by selected sex or stress hormones in the regulation of BDNF expression and signaling in the CNS.

AB  - Glomus cells in the carotid body are responsible for detecting changes in the partial pressure of blood oxygen (PO2). These glomus cells have recently been found to express leptin receptors and are activated by intermittent hypoxia (IH) and systemic leptin injections, although the function of leptin within the carotid body remains unknown. The present study was done to investigate whether IH activates leptin signalling pathways within leptin-expressing carotid body glomus cells. Rats were subjected to IH (120-s normoxia, 80-s hypoxia for 8 h) or normoxia (8 h). Exposure to IH increased plasma leptin levels almost sixfold compared to normoxic controls. Additionally, IH was found to increase leptin, ERK1/2 and Fra-1/2 immunoreactivity within glomus cells. Systemic leptin injections evoked similar effects on leptin, ERK1/2 and Fra-1/2 immunoreactivity within the glomus cells. Furthermore, using Western blot analysis, IH was found to increase protein expression of leptin, the short form of the leptin receptor (Ob-R100 kDa) and suppressor of cytokine signalling 3. On the other hand, IH induced a decrease in long form of leptin receptors (Ob-Rb) protein expression. Taken together, these data suggest that the increased levels of leptin within the circulation and those within the glomus cells induced by IH may alter carotid bodies chemosensitivity to hypoxic stimuli.

AB  - To investigate neurofilament (NF) dynamics during the cytoskeleton reorganization in regenerating axons, and their electrophysiological and histological consequences, we used two transgenic lines of mice: neurofilament high (NFH)-LacZ and NFH-green fluorescent protein (GFP). In NFH-LacZ mice, NFs are retained in cell bodies and deficient in axons (Eyer and Peterson, 1994), while in NFH-GFP mice the fluorescent fusion protein is normally transported along axons (Letournel et al., 2006). Following a crush of the sciatic nerve, conduction recovery in NFH-GFP mice is similar to wild-type (wt) mice, but it is reduced in NFH-LacZ mice. Moreover, changes of axonal calibres following regeneration are similar between NFH-GFP and wt mice, but they are systematically reduced in NFH-LacZ mice. Finally, the axonal transport of NFH-GFP fusion protein and NFs is re-initiated after the crush as evidenced by the fluorescent and immunolabelling of axons distal from the crushed point, but NFs and the fusion protein are not transported along axons during regeneration in NFH-LacZ mice. Together, these results argue that the absence of axonal NFs in NFH-LacZ mice compromises the axonal regeneration, and that the NFH-GFP reporter fusion protein represents an efficient model to evaluate the NF dynamics during axonal regeneration.

AB  - We investigated the effect of delayed, prolonged systemic inflammation on stroke outcomes and progesterone (P4) neuroprotection in middle-aged rats. After transient middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO) surgery, rats received P4 (8 or 16 mg/kg) or vehicle injections at 2 h, 6 h and every 24 h until day 7 post-occlusion. At 24 h post-injury systemic inflammation was induced by giving three doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 50 μg/kg, at 4 h intervals) to model post-stroke infections. We measured serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and behavioral parameters at multiple times. Serum BDNF levels decreased more in the vehicle + LPS group compared to vehicle-alone at 3 and 7 days post-injury (P &lt; 0.05). Vehicle-alone showed a significant increase in interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels at different times following stroke and these levels were further elevated in the vehicle + LPS group. P4 at both doses produced a significant (P &lt; 0.05) decline in cytokine levels compared to vehicle and vehicle + LPS. P4 restored BDNF levels at 3 and 7 days post-stroke (P &lt; 0.05). Behavioral assessment (rotarod, grip strength, sensory neglect and locomotor activity tests) at 3, 5 and 7 days post-stroke revealed that the vehicle group had significant (P &lt; 0.05) deficits in all tests compared to intact controls, and performance was worse in the vehicle + LPS group. P4 at both doses produced significant functional improvement on all tests. Systemic inflammation did not show an additive effect on infarct volume but P4 at both doses showed significant infarct reduction. We suggest that post-stroke infection exacerbates stroke outcomes and P4 exerts neuroprotective/modulatory effects through its systemic anti-inflammatory and BDNF regulatory actions.

AB  - High-mobility group box1 (HMGB1) protein is massively released into the cytoplasm and induces inflammation following various insults such as sepsis, acute cerebral ischemia, and pancreatitis. However, whether HMGB1 can act as an early proinflammatory cytokine to promote inflammation after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is unclear. We explored this question using a rat model of collagenase-induced ICH. We found that HMGB1 was released into the cytoplasm soon after ICH. Administration of ethyl pyruvate decreased the level of HMGB1 and microglia around the hematoma. Ethyl pyruvate also ameliorated ICH-induced neuronal apoptosis, cerebral edema, and neurological impairment. These findings suggest that HMGB1 may act as an early proinflammatory cytokine within the neurovascular unit to mediate inflammation during the acute phase of ICH.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder with a complex and variable set of symptoms. Both genetic and environmental mechanisms are involved in the development of the illness and lead to structural and neurochemical abnormalities in the brain. An intriguing facet of schizophrenia is sex differences, which have been described for nearly all features of the illness, including the peak age of onset, symptoms and treatment response. The ovarian hormone, estrogen, may be protective against schizophrenia and evidence is accumulating that estrogen may exert this effect via an interaction with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Both estrogen and BDNF have trophic effects on the developing brain and promote synaptic plasticity and maintain neurons well into adulthood. Major neurotransmitter systems including dopaminergic, serotonergic and glutamatergic pathways are modulated and supported by estrogen and BDNF. Despite their commonalities, estrogen and BDNF have mostly been examined independently but increasing evidence suggests an interaction between the two in brain regions pertinent to schizophrenia. This review will focus on the role of estrogen and BDNF in clinical and animal studies of schizophrenia. We include animal models of neurotransmitter dysfunction and genetic manipulation to show how estrogen may provide a protective effect in schizophrenia, including through mediating BDNF expression and activity. This posited estrogen–BDNF interaction could play a key role in modulating sex-dependent results reported in animal work as well as sex differences in clinical aspects of schizophrenia.

AB  - Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) has been proposed to have a neuroprotective effect on hippocampal neurons in animal models of epilepsy. However, the mechanisms of PARP-mediated epileptic neuron apoptosis in vitro are still not thoroughly understood. Therefore, we investigated the effect of PARP inhibition and the underlying mechanisms in the hippocampal neuronal culture model of acquired epilepsy which is generally accepted as the neuronal culture model of spontaneous seizure discharge in vitro. As a result, PARP was activated and the administration of 3,4-dihydro-5-[4-(1-piperidinyl)butoxy]-1(2H)-isoquinolinone (DPQ), an inhibitor of PARP, significantly decreased the percentage of neuron apoptosis induced by Mg2+-free treatment. Western blot and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) analysis showed that DPQ increased the phosphorylation of Akt and attenuated mitochondria-nucleus translocation of the apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Furthermore, wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI-3K, inhibited the translocation of AIF to the nucleus. The results of the present study demonstrated that the inhibition of PARP might have therapeutic value in seizure-induced hippocampal neuron damage in vitro via suppressing Akt-mediated AIF translocation.

AB  - The relationship between learning/memory performance and long-term potentiation (LTP) induction is ambiguous. Although a large body of data supports a strong correspondence between learning/memory performance and LTP, many studies have also provided evidence to the contrary. In this study, we found that 2-month-old senescence-accelerated mice/prone 8 (SAMP8 mice) displayed both impaired performance in a Morris Water Maze (MWM) and enhanced LTP compared to senescence-accelerated mice/resistance 1 (SAMR1). BALB/c mice challenged with Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA) performed better in the shuttle-box test but displayed impaired LTP compared to intact animals. It is interesting that BALB/c mice challenged with Incomplete Freund’s Adjuvant (IFA) performed better than intact animals, with no LTP impairment. Cytokine analysis showed no significant differences between the interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10) or TNF-α content in the intact hippocampal tissues of either the SAMR1 and SAMP8 mice or the immune-challenged BALB/c and intact animals. Further analysis demonstrated that the increase in cytokine content was higher in the hippocampal tissues used for LTP recording in the SAMR1 and CFA-challenged animals compared to the SAMP8 and intact BALB/c mice. A correlation analysis demonstrated that pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α) displayed a negative correlation with LTP, while an anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) displayed a positive correlation with LTP. These results suggest that pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by LTP manipulation in experiments (e.g., via tissue injury caused by electrode insertion) may be one of the factors contributing to the observed lack of correspondence between memory/learning ability and LTP.

AB  - Biofeedback training is an efficient means to gain control over a physiological function typically considered involuntary. Accordingly, learning to self-regulate nociceptive physiological activity may improve pain control by activating endogenous modulatory processes. The aim of the present study was to assess whether trial-by-trial visual feedback of nociceptive flexion reflex (RIII-reflex) responses (an index of spinal nociception) evoked by brief painful shocks applied to the sural nerve could be beneficial to guide participants in adopting strategies aiming at modulating pain perception. In order to determine specific changes induced by biofeedback, the modulation of RIII-reflex amplitude and pain ratings was compared following instructions to increase or decrease RIII-reflex amplitude in three groups, including a biofeedback group receiving a visual signal corresponding to the RIII-reflex amplitude (valid feedback), a sham biofeedback group (similar but invalid feedback), and a control group receiving no feedback. Results indicate that participants in all three groups could gain control over RIII-reflex (p &lt; 0.001), resulting in the modulation of pain intensity (p &lt; 0.001) and pain unpleasantness (p &lt; 0.001). The biofeedback group was not significantly superior to the sham and the control groups in the modulation of RIII-reflex amplitude, pain intensity or unpleasantness. These results are consistent with the notion that RIII-reflex amplitude and pain perception can be modulated voluntarily by various cognitive strategies. However, immediate retrospective visual feedback of acute nociceptive responses presented iteratively in successive trials may not improve the efficacy of these self-regulation processes.

AB  - The neuropeptide arginine vasopressin (AVP) exerts a modulatory role on hippocampal excitability through vasopressin V1A and V1B receptors. However, the origin and mode of termination of the AVP innervation of the hippocampus remain unknown. We have used light and electron microscopy to trace the origin, distribution and synaptic relationships of AVP-immuno-positive fibres and nerve terminals in the rat hippocampus. Immuno-positive fibres were present in all areas (CA1–3, dentate gyrus) of the whole septo-temporal extent of the hippocampus; they had the highest density in the CA2 region, strongly increasing in density towards the ventral hippocampus. Two types of fibres were identified, both establishing synaptic junctions. Type A had large varicosities packed with immuno-positive large-granulated peptidergic vesicles and few small clear vesicles forming type I synaptic junctions with pyramidal neuron dendrites, dendritic spines and with axonal spines. Type B had smaller varicosities containing mostly small clear vesicles and only a few large-granulated vesicles and established type II synaptic junctions mainly with interneuron dendrites. The AVP-positive axons in stratum oriens appeared to follow and contact metabotropic glutamate receptor 1α (mGluR1α)-immuno-positive interneuron dendrites. Fluoro-Gold injection into the hippocampus revealed retrogradely labelled AVP-positive somata in hypothalamic supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei. Hypothalamo-hippocampal AVP-positive axons entered the hippocampus mostly through a ventral route, also innervating the amygdala and to a lesser extent through the dorsal fimbria fornix, in continuation of the septal AVP innervation. Thus, it appears the AVP-containing neurons of the magnocellular hypothalamic nuclei serve as important sources for hippocampal AVP innervation, although the AVP-expressing neurons located in amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis reported previously may also contribute.

AB  - d-Cycloserine (DCS), a co-agonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, has proven to be an effective adjunct to cognitive behavioral therapies that utilize extinction. This pharmacological-based enhancement of extinction memory has been primarily demonstrated in neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by pathological fear (e.g. posttraumatic stress disorder and various phobias). More recently, there has been an interest in applying such a strategy in the disorders of appetitive learning (e.g. substance abuse and other addictions), but these studies have generated mixed results. Here we first examined whether extinction memory encoding in a sucrose self-administration model is dependent on NMDA receptors. The NMDA antagonist (±)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (5 mg/kg, i.p.) administered 2 h prior to the first extinction training session effectively inhibited extinction memory recall 24 h later, without affecting the expression of the conditioned sucrose-seeking response while the drug was on board. This profile of effects suggests a specific effect on extinction memory consolidation. Next, we sought to enhance extinction memory using the co-agonist DCS (10 μg/side) by infusion directly into infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex, a brain site implicated in extinction memory recall in conditioned fear models. Indeed, infusion of DCS immediately after the first extinction training session effectively enhanced extinction memory recall 24 h later. Collectively, these data suggest that the neurobiological mechanisms and the neurocircuitry mediating extinction memory are similar regardless of the valence (aversive or appetitive) of the conditioned behavior, and that similar pharmacological strategies for treatment may be applied to neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by a failure to inhibit pathological emotional memories.

AB  - Few studies have investigated whether neuronal function in the amygdaloid complex is necessary for the occurrence of the cardiovascular response to natural (unconditioned) environmental threats. In the present investigation in conscious unrestrained Sprague–Dawley rats we inactivated neuronal function in the amygdaloid complex acutely (bilateral muscimol injections) or chronically (unilateral or bilateral ibotenic acid injections) and measured the effect on sudden falls in tail artery blood flow elicited by non-noxious salient stimuli (sympathetic cutaneous vasomotor alerting responses, SCVARs). After acute bilateral injection of vehicle (200 nl Ringer’s solution) the SCVAR index was 81 ± 2%, indicating that tail blood flow was reduced by 81% in response to the salient stimuli. After acute bilateral injection of muscimol (1 nmol in 200 nl of Ringer’s solution) into the amygdaloid complex the SCVAR index was 49 ± 5%, indicating that tail blood flow was reduced by 49% in response to the salient stimuli (p &lt; 0.01 versus vehicle, n = 7 rats for vehicle and 6 for muscimol). One week after unilateral ibotenic acid lesions, the SCVAR index was 68 ± 3%, significantly less than 90 ± 1%, the corresponding value after unilateral injection of vehicle (p &lt; 0.01, n = 6 rats in each group). After bilateral ibotenic acid lesions the SCVAR index was 52 ± 4%, significantly less than 93 ± 1%, the corresponding value after bilateral injection of vehicle (p &lt; 0.001, n = 6 rats in each group). Ibotenic acid caused extensive neuronal destruction of the whole amygdaloid complex, as well as lateral temporal lobe structures including the piriform cortex. Our results demonstrate that the amygdaloid complex plays an important role in mediating the tail artery vasoconstriction that occurs in rats in response to the animal’s perception of a salient stimulus, redirecting blood to areas of the body with more immediate metabolic requirements.

AB  - Like other marsupials, the opossum Monodelphis domestica is born very immature and crawls, unaided by the mother, from the urogenital opening to a nipple where it attaches and pursues its development. If the alternate, rhythmic movements of the forelimbs which allow this locomotion are generated by the developing spinal motor networks, sensory information is nonetheless needed to guide the newborn to a nipple. Behavioral, anatomical and physiological studies suggest that the auditory and the visual systems are insufficiently developed in newborn opossums to influence spinal motor centers, while the vestibular, trigeminal, and olfactory systems are likelier candidates. The trigeminal, vestibular and olfactory regions of the brain were electrically stimulated to test their relative effectiveness at eliciting forelimb movement in newborn opossums, using in vitro preparations of brain-spinal cord with the limbs attached. The minimal stimulation of the cervical spinal cord needed to induce forelimb movement was considered as threshold (T). Stimulations of the trigeminal ganglion (5G) at ∼2 T and of the vestibular complex at ∼20 T could induce the same movement, and were not statistically different, in contrast to the ∼600 T necessary for the olfactory bulb (OB). Neurofilament-200 immunohistochemistry and retrograde tracing with Texas-Red conjugated Dextran Amines were used to study trigeminal innervation of the facial skin and pathways by which trigeminal inputs may be relayed to the spinal cord. Numerous nerve fibers were observed in the snout dermis, especially in the maxillary region, but also elsewhere in the head skin. Some 5G cells project to the upper spinal cord, but more project to the caudal medulla where they could contact secondary trigeminal neurons or reticular cells projecting to the spinal cord. These results support a significant influence of the trigeminal and the vestibular systems, but not of olfaction, on forelimb movement of neonatal opossums.

AB  - The parasubiculum sends its single major output to layer II of the entorhinal cortex, and it may therefore interact with inputs to the entorhinal cortex from other cortical areas, and help to shape the activity of layer II entorhinal cells that project to the hippocampal formation. Cholinergic inputs are thought to contribute to the generation of theta- and gamma-frequency activities in the parasubiculum and entorhinal cortex, and the present study assessed how cholinergic receptor activation affects synaptic responses of the entorhinal cortex to theta- and gamma-frequency stimulation. Depth profiles of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in acute brain slices showed a short-latency negative fEPSP in layer II, consistent with the activation of excitatory synaptic inputs to layer II. Application of the cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh) suppressed synaptic responses and enhanced paired-pulse facilitation. CCh also resulted in a marked relative facilitation of synaptic responses evoked during short 5-pulse trains of stimulation at both theta- and gamma-frequencies. Application of the M1 antagonist pirenzepine, but not the M2 antagonist methoctramine, blocked the facilitation of responses. Inhibition of the M-current or block of GABAB receptors had no effect, but the facilitation effect was partially blocked by the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist APV, indicating that NMDA receptors play a role. Application of ZD7288, a selective inhibitor of the hyperpolarization-activated cationic current Ih, almost completely blocked the relative facilitation of responses, and the less potent Ih-blocker Cs+ also resulted in a partial block. The relative facilitation of synaptic responses induced by CCh is therefore likely mediated by multiple mechanisms including the cholinergic suppression of transmitter release that enhances transmitter availability during repetitive stimulation, NMDA receptor-mediated effects on pre- or postsynaptic function, and cholinergic modulation of the current Ih. These mechanisms likely contribute to the maintenance of effective synaptic communication within parasubicular inputs to the entorhinal cortex during cholinergically induced rhythmic states.

AB  - The 5- and 12/15-lipoxygenase (LOX) isozymes have been implicated to contribute to disease development in CNS disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. These LOX isozymes are distinct in function, with differential effects on neuroinflammation, and the impact of the distinct isozymes in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease has not as yet been evaluated. To determine whether the isozymes contribute differently to nigrostriatal vulnerability, the effects of 5- and 12/15-LOX deficiency on dopaminergic tone under naïve and toxicant-challenged conditions were tested. In naïve mice deficient in 5-LOX expression, a modest but significant reduction (18.0% reduction vs. wildtype (WT)) in striatal dopamine (DA) was detected (n = 6–8 per genotype). A concomitant decline in striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) enzyme was also revealed in null 5-LOX vs. WT mice (26.2%); however, no changes in levels of DA or TH immunoreactivity were observed in null 12/15-LOX vs. WT mice. When challenged with the selective dopaminergic toxin, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), WT mice showed a marked reduction in DA (31.9%) and robust astrocytic and microglial activation as compared to saline-treated animals. In contrast, null 5-LOX littermates demonstrated no significant striatal DA depletion or astrogliosis (as noted by Western blot analyses for glial acidic fibrillary protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity). In naïve null 12/15-LOX mice, no significant change in striatal DA values was observed compared to WT, and following MPTP treatment, the transgenics revealed striatal DA reduction similar to the challenged WT mice. Taken together, these data provide the first evidence that: (i) LOX isozymes are involved in the maintenance of normal dopaminergic function in the striatum and (ii) the 5- and 12/15-LOX isozymes contribute differentially to striatal vulnerability in response to neurotoxicant challenge.

AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder manifesting in motor, cognitive and behavioral anomalies. Loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra region of the brain is the hallmark feature of PD, which is attributed to oxidative and inflammatory stress besides other diverse factors and hence drugs targeting these pathways hold promise as neuro-therapeutics.

The anti-oxidative as well as anti-inflammatory properties of sodium salicylate (SS), suggest its neuroprotective potentials in PD. Since PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, the mechanistic basis for utilizing SS as a neuroprotectant in PD could be better understood in the chronic models. The present study utilizes a rotenone-based model of PD to evaluate the neuro-modulatory efficacy of SS. Subcutaneous injection of rotenone (2 mg/kg body weight) was given to male SD rats every day, for a period of 5 weeks, which developed all the essential features of PD in these animals. Simultaneously, another group was injected SS intraperitoneally at the dose of 100 mg/kg body weight, in addition to the rotenone. In the animals receiving rotenone + SS, significant improvement was observed in the various characteristic hallmarks of PD such as dopamine and tyrosine hydroxylase levels as well as the motor dysfunction symptoms. It attenuated the reactive oxygen species levels significantly but failed to reduce the levels of protein carbonylation and lipid peroxidation. However, SS effectively abridged the levels of inflammatory mediators like cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), nuclear factor kappa B and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Correspondingly, a significant decrease in the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6, interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α was also observed following SS co-treatment. Thus, neuroprotective efficacy of SS in this chronic model of PD can be largely attributed to its anti-inflammatory effects rather than its free radical-scavenging properties.

AB  - Neuronal responses in primary visual cortex (V1) can be suppressed by a stimulus presented to the extraclassical surround, and such interactions are thought to be critical for figure ground segregation and form perception. While surround suppression likely originates from both feedforward afferents and multiple cortical circuits, it is unclear what role each circuit plays in the surround’s orientation tuning. To investigate this we recorded from single units in V1 of anesthetized cat and analyzed the orientation tuning of the suppressive-surround over time. In addition, based on orientation maps derived through optical imaging prior to recording, neurons were classified as being located in domains or pinwheels. For both types of neurons, shortly after response onset (10 ms) the suppressive-surround is broadly tuned to orientation, but this is followed by a steep improvement in tuning over the next ∼30 ms. While the tuning of the pinwheel cells plateaus at this point, tuning is enhanced further for domain cells, especially those located superficially in the cortex, reaching a peak at 80 ms from response onset. This relatively slow evolution of the orientation tuning of the suppressive surround suggests that fast-arriving feedforward circuits (10 ms) likely only provide broadly tuned suppression, but that feedback from higher visual areas which is likely to arrive over the next 30 ms and can cover both the receptive field center and the extraclassical surround contributes to the initial steep rise in tuning for both cell types. Moreover, we speculate that the even later enhancement in tuning for domain neurons could mean the involvement of inputs from relatively long-range lateral connections, which not only propagate slowly but also link like-oriented domains corresponding to the receptive field of only the extraclassical surround.

AB  - Handedness is most often measured by questionnaires that assess an individual’s preference for using a particular hand to perform a variety of tasks. While such assessments have proved reliable, they do not address the underlying neurobehavioral processes that give rise to the choice of which hand to use. Recent research has indicated that handedness is associated with hemispheric specializations for different aspects of sensorimotor performance. We now hypothesize that an individual’s choice of which hand to use for a given task should result from an interaction between these underlying neurobehavioral asymmetries with task conditions. We test this hypothesis by manipulating two factors in targeted reaching movements: (1) region of workspace and (2) visual feedback conditions. The first manipulation modified the geometric and dynamic requirements of the task for each arm, whereas the second modified the sensorimotor performance asymmetries, an effect predicted by previous literature. We expected that arm choice would be reflected by an interaction between these factors. Our results indicated that removing visual feedback both improved the relative performance of the non-dominant arm and increased the choice to use this arm for targets near midline, an effect that was enhanced for targets requiring larger movement amplitudes. We explain these findings in the context of the dynamic dominance hypothesis of handedness and discuss their implications for the link between hemispheric asymmetries in neural control and hand preference.

AB  - Previous anatomical and physiological studies suggest that the superior colliculus sends integrated sensory information to the multimodal cortical areas via the thalamic suprageniculate nucleus (SG). However, the detailed distribution of rat tecto-SG axon terminals and SG neurons projecting to the multimodal cortex, as well as synaptic connections between these tectal axons and SG neurons, remains unclear.

In this study, the organization of the tecto-thalamo-cortical pathway was investigated via combined injections of anterograde and retrograde tracers followed by light and electron microscopic observations. Injections of a retrograde tracer, cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), into the temporal cortex, area 2, dorsal part (Te2D), and injections of an anterograde tracer, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA), into the deep layers of the superior colliculus produced the following results: (1) Retrogradely CTB-labeled neurons were found throughout SG, predominantly in its rostral part. CTB-labeled neurons were also found in other cortical areas such as the visual cortex, the auditory cortex, the parietal association cortex, and the perirhinal cortex. (2) Anterogradely BDA-labeled axons and their terminals were also observed throughout SG. Dual visualization of BDA and CTB showed that retrogradely labeled SG neurons and anterogradely labeled tectal axon terminal boutons overlapped considerably in the rostral part of SG, and their direct synaptic contacts were also confirmed via electron microscopy. These findings suggest that multimodal information from the superior colliculus can be processed directly in SG neurons projecting to Te2D.

AB  - Adolescence is a time of continued brain maturation, particularly in limbic and cortical regions, which undoubtedly plays a role in the physiological and emotional changes coincident with adolescence. An emerging line of research has indicated that stressors experienced during this crucial developmental stage may affect the trajectory of this neural maturation and contribute to the increase in psychological morbidities, such as anxiety and depression, often observed during adolescence. In this review, we discuss the short- and long-term effects of periadolescent stress exposure on the structure and function of the brain. More specifically, we examine how stress at prepubertal and early adolescent stages of development affects the morphological plasticity of limbic and cortical brain regions, as well as the enduring effects of adolescent stress exposure on these brain regions in adulthood. We suggest that, due to a number of converging factors during this period of maturation, the adolescent brain may be particularly sensitive to stress-induced neurobehavioral dysfunctions with important consequences on an individual’s immediate and long-term health and well-being.

AB  - In adult rats, trans-resveratrol attenuates kainic acid (KA)-induced convulsions and the associated hippocampal neurotoxicity. Increased neuronal survival was correlated with reduced lipid peroxidation. Since free radical generation after KA is age dependent and does not correlate with the onset of seizure-induced injury, the present study investigated whether daily trans-resveratrol treatment in development could protect the juvenile hippocampus from seizures and onset of damage at postnatal (P) day 21. Rat pups were treated with daily injections of trans-resveratrol under three dosage regimens (1–15 mg/kg and 20–50 mg/kg). Weight, electroencephalography (EEG), histology, and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor expression were determined. Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration was assessed from separate animals. trans-Resveratrol did not interfere with growth or attenuate KA-induced EEG seizures. However, modest protection was afforded in the CA1, the subregion most sensitive to injury at this age. The CA3 and entorhinal amygdala cortex (AMG/EC) were not spared. Changes in NR1 subunit or NR1 C2 splice variant expression were also not prevented. Baseline MDA concentrations of hippocampal subfields were low at P14, P21, and P60 and high in aged adults. Glutamate (100 μM) to stimulate peroxidation products was significant at young ages but was much greater at older ages. After KA, elevated MDA levels were observed at 24 h but only in adult preparations. Thus, while antioxidant therapy with trans-resveratrol may be considered as an adjunctive therapy to hinder epileptic activity and neurodegeneration at adult ages, it had only modest effects at young ages when production of free radicals within limbic structures is limited in this experimental model of seizures.

AB  - Middle-aged Americans have higher obesity rates than any other age group, yet little is known about age-related changes in central taste function during this critical time. Research on taste and aging has primarily focused on psychophysical responses, and on older adults. Central taste processing in middle-age has not been investigated. In the current study, we compared functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation of young and middle-aged adults during hedonic evaluation of a sweet and a bitter taste. A 2 (age group) by 2 (tastant) analysis of variance (ANOVA) on fMRI activation revealed: (1) a main effect of age (young adults &gt; middle-aged adults) in the bilateral anterior cingulate, lentiform nucleus, putamen, caudate, and right precentral gyrus; (2) a main effect of taste (sweet &gt; bitter) in the bilateral pre- and postcentral gyri, anterior cingulate and right middle frontal gyrus; qualified by (3) an age-by-taste interaction. Further inspection of the age-by-taste interaction revealed that there was a significant effect of age (greater activation in young adults) in sensory (insula) and reward (lentiform nucleus) regions during hedonic evaluation of the sweet taste; however, there was no age effect in the bitter taste condition. Further, young adults had greater responses during hedonic evaluation of sucrose than of caffeine in several sensory and motor processing regions (pre- and postcentral gyri, insula), but there were no taste-related differences in activation in the middle-aged adults. We speculate that these results might reflect early age-related differences in central taste processing that occur prior to deficits in gustatory function observed in old age, and this might have important implications for weight changes that occur during middle-age.

AB  - Adderall is widely prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) though long term neurological effects of the main ingredient d-amphetamine are not well understood. The purpose of this study was to examine effects of clinically prescribed doses of d-amphetamine and one abuse dose administered from childhood to adulthood on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and activation of the granule layer of the dentate gyrus. Beginning in early adolescence (age 28 days) to adulthood (age 71), male C57BL/6J mice were administered twice daily i.p. injections of vehicle, 0.25, 0.5 or 2 mg/kg d-amphetamine. Locomotor activity was measured in home cages by video tracking. At age 53–56, mice received bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) injections to label dividing cells. Immunohistochemical detection of BrdU, neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN), doublecortin (DCX) and Ki67 was used to measure neurogenesis and cell proliferation at age 71. ΔFosB was measured as an indicator of repeated neuronal activation. An additional cohort of mice was treated similarly except euthanized at age 58 to measure activation of granule neurons from d-amphetamine (by detection of c-Fos) and cell proliferation (Ki67) at a time when the fate of BrdU cells would have been determined in the first cohort. d-Amphetamine dose-dependently increased survival and differentiation of BrdU cells into neurons and increased number of DCX cells without affecting the number of Ki67 cells. Low doses of d-amphetamine decreased c-Fos and ΔFosB in the granule layer. Only the high dose induced substantial locomotor stimulation and sensitization. Results suggest both therapeutic and abuse doses of d-amphetamine increase the number of new neurons in the hippocampus when administered from adolescence to adulthood by increasing survival and differentiation of cells into neurons not by increasing progenitor cell proliferation. Mechanisms for amphetamine-induced neurogenesis are unknown but appear activity independent. Results suggest part of the beneficial effects of therapeutic doses of d-amphetamine for ADHD could be via increased hippocampal neurogenesis.

AB  - Despite modern imaging techniques, assessing and localizing changes in brain activity during whole-body exercise is still challenging. Using an active electroencephalography (EEG) system in combination with source localization algorithms, this study aimed to localize brain cortical oscillations patterns in the motor cortex and to correlate these with surface electromyography (EMG)-detected muscular activity during pedaling exercise.

Eight subjects performed 2-min isokinetic (90 rpm) cycling bouts at intensities ranging from 1 to 5 W kg−1 body mass on a cycle ergometer. These bouts were interspersed by a minimum of 2 min of passive rest to limit to development of peripheral muscle fatigue. Brain cortical activity within the motor cortex was analyzed using a 32-channel active EEG system combined with source localization algorithms. EMG activity was recorded from seven muscles on each lower limb.

EEG and EMG activity revealed comparatively stable oscillations across the different exercise intensities. More importantly, the oscillations in cortical activity within the motor cortex were significantly correlated with EMG activity during the high-intensity cycling bouts.

This study demonstrates that it is possible to localize oscillations in brain cortical activity during moderate- to high-intensity cycling exercise using EEG in combination with source localization algorithms, and that these oscillations match the activity of the active muscles in time and amplitude.

Results of this study might help to further evaluate the effects of central vs. peripheral fatigue during exercise.

AB  - Estrogen’s acute, facilitatory effects on glutamatergic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) provide a potential explanation for the steroid’s considerable influence on behavior. Recent work has identified mechanisms underlying these synaptic actions. Brief infusion of 17ß-estradiol (E2) into adult male rat hippocampal slices triggers actin polymerization within dendritic spines via a signaling cascade beginning with the GTPase RhoA and ending with inactivation of the filament-severing protein cofilin. Blocking this sequence, or actin polymerization itself, eliminates E2’s effects on synaptic physiology. Notably, the theta burst stimulation used to induce LTP activates the same signaling pathway as E2 plus events that stabilize the reorganization of the sub-synaptic cytoskeleton. These observations suggest that E2 elicits a partial form of LTP, resulting in an increase of fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and a reduction in the threshold for lasting synaptic changes. While E2’s effects on the cytoskeleton could be direct, results described here indicate that the hormone activates synaptic tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) receptors for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a releasable neurotrophin that stimulates the RhoA to cofilin pathway. It is therefore possible that E2 acts via transactivation of neighboring receptors to modify the composition and structure of excitatory contacts. Finally, there is the question of whether a loss of acute synaptic actions contributes to the memory problems associated with estrogen depletion. Initial tests found that ovariectomy in middle-aged rats disrupts RhoA signaling, actin polymerization, and LTP consolidation. Acute applications of E2 reversed these defects, a result consistent with the idea that disturbances to actin management are one cause of behavioral effects that emerge with reductions in steroid levels.

AB  - Tissue and nerve damage can result in chronic pain. Yet, chronic pain after cesarean delivery is remarkably rare in women and hypersensitivity from peripheral nerve injury in rats resolves rapidly if the injury occurs in the puerperium. Little is known regarding the mechanisms of this protection except for a reliance on central nervous system oxytocin signaling. Here we show that the density of inhibitory noradrenergic fibers in the spinal cord is greater when nerve injury is performed in rats during the puerperium, whereas the expression of the excitatory regulators dynorphin A and neuregulin-1 in the spinal cord is reduced. The puerperium did not alter spinal cord microgial and astrocyte activation. Astrocyte activation, as measured by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression, was not evident in female rats with injury, regardless of delivery status suggesting sex differences in spinal astrocyte activation after injury. These results suggest a change in the descending inhibitory/facilitating balance on spinal nociception neurotransmission during the puerperium, as mechanisms for its protective effect against injury-induced hypersensitivity.

AB  - To maximize reward, we are faced with the dilemma of having to balance the exploration of new response options and the exploitation of previous choices. Here, we sought to determine if the event-related brain potential (ERP) in the P300 time range is sensitive to decisions to explore or exploit within the context of a sequential risk-taking task. Specifically, the task we used required participants to continually explore their options—whether they should “push their luck” and keep gambling or “take the money and run” and collect their winnings. Our behavioral analysis yielded two distinct distributions of response times: a larger group of short-decision times and a smaller group of long-decision times. Interestingly, these data suggest that participants adopted one of two modes of control on any given trial: a mode where they quickly decided to keep gambling (i.e. exploit), and a mode where they deliberated whether to the take the money they had already won or continue gambling (i.e. explore). Importantly, we found that the amplitude of the ERP in the P300 time range was larger for explorative decisions than for exploitative decisions and, further, was correlated with decision time. Our results are consistent with a recent theoretical account that links changes in ERP amplitude in the P300 time range with phasic activity of the locus coeruleus–norepinephrine system and decisions to engage in exploratory behavior.

AB  - Here we investigate the contribution of striatal dopamine receptors (D1) to the influence of reward-magnitude on learning. Pigeons (Columba livia) were trained on a discrimination-task with two pairs of stimuli; correct discrimination resulted in a large reward in one pair of stimuli and in a small reward in the other pair. Acquisition of the discrimination-task was accompanied by intracranial injections to the medial striatum, either of a dopamine-antagonist (Sch23390) or of vehicle. In the control-condition the rate of learning was modulated by the magnitude of the reward; discrimination was learned faster if contingent rewards were large and learning was slower if contingent rewards were small. Following injections of D1 antagonist this effect vanished even though the ability to discriminate between the rewards was unaffected. Interestingly, the mean rate of learning was indistinguishable between the control and antagonist conditions. Consequently, it appears that not learning per se but the effect of reward-magnitude on learning is mediated through D1 receptors in the striatum.

We argue that the injections of dopamine-antagonist cause a shift in strategy underlying learning. In the control-condition animals rely on positive feedback and thus learning is affected by the magnitude of the contingent reward; in the antagonist-condition, however, learning might rely on negative feedback and is thus insensitive to reward-magnitude.

AB  - Leptin microinjections into the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) have been shown to elicit sympathoexcitatory responses, and potentiate the cardiovascular responses to activation of the chemoreflex. In this study, experiments were done in Sprague–Dawley rats initially to provide a detailed mapping within the NTS complex of cells containing immunoreactivity to the long form of the leptin receptor (Ob-Rb). In a second series, this NTS region containing Ob-Rb immunoreactive cells was explored for single units antidromically activated by stimulation of pressor sites in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). These antidromically identified neurons were then tested for their response to intra-carotid injections of leptin (50–100 ng/0.1 ml), and to activation of peripheral chemoreceptors following an injection of potassium cyanide (KCN) (80 μg/0.1 ml) into the carotid artery. Cells containing Ob-Rb-like immunoreactivity were found predominantly in the caudal NTS: within the medial, commissural and gelatinous (sub-postremal area) subnuclei of the NTS complex. Of 73 single units tested in these NTS regions, 48 were antidromically activated by stimulation of RVLM pressor sites and 25 of these single units responded with an increase in discharge rate after intra-carotid injections of leptin. In addition, 17 of these leptin responsive neurons were excited by the intra-carotid injections of KCN (80 μg/0.1 ml). Furthermore, the excitatory response of these single units to KCN was potentiated (59–83%) immediately following the leptin injection. These data indicate that leptin responsive neurons in NTS mediate chemoreceptor afferent information to pressor sites in the RVLM, and suggest that leptin may act as a facilitator on neuronal circuits within the NTS that potentiates the sympathoexcitatory responses elicited during the reflex activation of arterial chemoreceptors.

AB  - Although respiratory complications are a major cause of morbidity/mortality in many neural injuries or diseases, little is known concerning mechanisms whereby deficient myelin impairs breathing, or how patients compensate for such changes. Here, we tested the hypothesis that respiratory and forelimb motor functions are impaired in a rat model of focal dorsolateral spinal demyelination (ethidium bromide, EB). Ventilation, phrenic nerve activity and horizontal ladder walking were performed 7–14 days post-C2 injection of EB or vehicle (SHAM). EB caused dorsolateral demyelination at C2–C3 followed by significant spontaneous remyelination at 14 days post-EB. Although ventilation did not differ between groups, ipsilateral integrated phrenic nerve burst amplitude was significantly reduced versus SHAM during chemoreceptor activation at 7 days post-EB but recovered by 14 days. The ratio of ipsi- to contralateral phrenic nerve amplitude correlated with cross-sectional lesion area. This ratio was significantly reduced 7 days post-EB versus SHAM during baseline conditions, and versus SHAM and 14-day groups during chemoreceptor activation. Limb function ipsilateral to EB was impaired 7 days post-EB and partially recovered by 14 days post-EB. EB provides a reversible model of focal, spinal demyelination, and may be a useful model to study mechanisms of functional impairment and recovery via motor plasticity, or the efficacy of new therapeutic interventions to reduce severity or duration of disease.

AB  - Nicotinic receptors have been linked to a wide range of cognitive and behavioral functions, but surprisingly little is known about their involvement in cost benefit decision making. The goal of these experiments was to determine how nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) expression is related to two forms of cost benefit decision making. Male Long Evans rats were tested in probability- and delay-discounting tasks, which required discrete trial choices between a small reward and a large reward associated with varying probabilities of omission and varying delays to reward delivery, respectively. Following testing, radioligand binding to α4β2∗ and α7 nAChR subtypes in brain regions implicated in cost benefit decision making was examined. Significant linear relationships were observed between choice of the large delayed reward in the delay discounting task and α4β2∗ receptor binding in both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Additionally, trends were found suggesting that choice of the large costly reward in both discounting tasks was inversely related to α4β2∗ receptor binding in the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens shell. Similar trends suggested that choice of the large delayed reward in the delay discounting task was inversely related to α4β2∗ receptor binding in the orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens core, and basolateral amygdala, as well as to α7 receptor binding in the basolateral amygdala. These data suggest that nAChRs (particularly α4β2∗) play both unique and common roles in decisions that require consideration of different types of reward costs.

AB  - Peripheral nerve injury evokes rapid and complex changes in gene transcription and cellular signaling pathways. Understanding how these changes are functionally related is essential for developing new approaches that accelerate and improve nerve regeneration. Toward this goal we found that nerve injury induces a rapid and significant up-regulation of the transcription factor Sox11 in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. Gain and loss of function studies have shown this increase is essential for normal axon regeneration. To determine how Sox11 impacts neuronal gene expression, DRG neurons were treated with Sox11 siRNA to identify potential transcriptional targets. One gene significantly reduced by Sox11 knockdown was TRAF (tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor)-associated NF-κB activator (TANK). Here we show that TANK is expressed in DRG neurons, that TANK expression is increased in response to peripheral nerve injury and that Sox11 overexpression in vitro increases TANK expression. Injury and in vitro overexpression were also found to preferentially increase TANK transcript variant 3 and a larger TANK protein isoform. To determine if Sox11 regulates TANK transcription bioinformatic analysis was used to identify potential Sox-binding motifs within 5 kbp of the TANK 5′ untranslated region (UTR) across several mammalian genomes. Two sites in the mouse TANK gene were examined. Luciferase expression assays coupled with site-directed mutagenesis showed each site contributes to enhanced TANK promoter activity. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed direct Sox11 binding in regions containing the two identified Sox motifs in the mouse TANK 5′-UTR. These studies are the first to show that TANK is expressed in DRG neurons, that TANK is increased by peripheral nerve injury and that the regulation of TANK expression is, at least in part, controlled by the injury-associated transcription factor Sox11.

AB  - Abstract
One hypothesis to account for the onset and severity of neurological disorders is the loss of trophic support. Indeed, changes in the levels and activities of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) occur in numerous neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases. A deficit promotes vulnerability whereas a gain of function facilitates recovery by enhancing survival, synapse formation and synaptic plasticity. Implementation of ‘BDNF therapies’, however, faces numerous methodological and pharmacokinetic issues. Identifying BDNF mimetics that activate the BDNF receptor or downstream targets of BDNF signaling represent an alternative approach. One mechanism that shows great promise is to study the interplay of BDNF and glucocorticoid hormones, a major class of natural steroid secreted during stress reactions and in synchrony with circadian rhythms. While small amounts of glucocorticoids support normal brain function, excess stimulation by these steroid hormones precipitates stress-related affective disorders. To date, however, because of the paucity of knowledge of underlying cellular mechanisms, deleterious effects of glucocorticoids are not prevented following extreme stress. In the present review, we will discuss the complementary roles shared by BDNF and glucocorticoids in synaptic plasticity, and delineate possible signaling mechanisms mediating these effects.

AB  - There is increasing evidence for adolescence as a time period vulnerable to environmental perturbations such as stress. What is unclear is the persistent nature of the effects of stress and how specific these effects are to the type of stressor. In this review, we describe the effects of chronic, unpredictable stress (CUS) exposure during adolescence on adult behavior and brain morphology and function in animal models. We provide evidence for adolescence as a critical window for the effects of physical CUS that persist into adulthood, with ramifications for morphological development, associated hippocampal-dependent tasks, and anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors. The results of this investigation are contrasted against those of social CUS stress exposure from the same time period that show reversible and, in the case of responses to drugs of abuse, potentially protective effects in adulthood. Finally, we discuss potential underlying mechanisms for these morphological and behavioral findings. It is our aim that the research highlighted in this review will aid in our understanding of the role of stress in adolescent mental health and development. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Stress, Emotional Behavior and the Endocannabinoid System.

AB  - Interaction between steroid sex hormones and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a common feature of vertebrate brain organization. The avian song control system provides an excellent model for studying such interactions in neural circuits that regulate song, a learned sensorimotor behavior that is often sexually dimorphic and restricted to reproductive contexts. Testosterone (T) and its steroid metabolites interact with BDNF during development of the song system and in adult plasticity, including the addition of newborn neurons to the pallial nucleus HVC and seasonal changes in structure and function of these circuits. T and BDNF interact locally within HVC to influence cell proliferation and survival. This interaction may also occur transsynpatically; T increases the synthesis of BDNF in HVC, and BDNF protein is then released on to postsynaptic cells in the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) where it has trophic effects. The interaction between sex steroids and BDNF is an example of molecular exploitation, with the evolutionarily ancient steroid-receptor complex having been captured by the more recently evolved BDNF. The functional linkage of sex steroids to BDNF may be of adaptive value in regulating the trophic effects of the neurotrophin in sexually dimorphic and reproductively relevant contexts.

AB  - It is well-known that the onset of puberty is associated with changes in mood as well as cognition. Stress can have an impact on these outcomes, which in many cases, can be more influential in females, suggesting that gender differences exist. The adolescent period is a vulnerable time for the onset of certain psychopathologies, including anxiety disorders, depression and eating disorders, which are also more prevalent in females. One factor which may contribute to stress-triggered anxiety at puberty is the GABAA receptor (GABAR), which is known to play a pivotal role in anxiety. Expression of α4βδ GABARs increases on the dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells at the onset of puberty in the hippocampus, part of the limbic circuitry which governs emotion. This receptor is a sensitive target for the stress steroid 3α-OH-5[α]β-pregnan-20-one or [allo]pregnanolone, which paradoxically reduces inhibition and increases anxiety during the pubertal period (post-natal day ∼35–44) of female mice in contrast to its usual effect to enhance inhibition and reduce anxiety. Spatial learning and synaptic plasticity are also adversely impacted at puberty, likely a result of increased expression of α4βδ GABARs on the dendritic spines of CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells, which are essential for consolidation of memory. This review will focus on the role of these receptors in mediating behavioral changes at puberty. Stress-mediated changes in mood and cognition in early adolescence may have relevance for the expression of psychopathologies in adulthood.

AB  - The medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) is a vital structure of sound localization circuits in the auditory brainstem. Each principal cell of MNTB is contacted by a very large presynaptic glutamatergic terminal, the calyx of Held. The MNTB principal cells themselves are surrounded by extracellular matrix components forming prominent perineuronal nets (PNs). Throughout the CNS, PNs, which form lattice-like structures around the somata and proximal dendrites, are associated with distinct types of neurons. PNs are highly enriched in hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans therefore providing a charged surface structure surrounding the cell body and proximal neurites of these neurons. The localization and composition of PNs have lead investigators to a number of hypotheses about their functions including: creating a specific extracellular ionic milieu around these neurons, stabilizing synapses, and influencing the outgrowth of axons. However, presently the precise functions of PNs are still quite unclear primarily due to the lack of an ideal experimental model system that is highly enriched in PNs and in which the synaptic transmission properties can be precisely measured. The MNTB principal cells could offer such a model, since they have been extensively characterized electrophysiologically. However, extracellular matrix (ECM) in these neurons has not yet been precisely detailed. The present study gives a detailed examination of the ECM organization and structural differences in PNs of the mouse MNTB. The different PN components and their distribution pattern are scrutinized throughout the MNTB. The data are complemented by electron microscopic investigations of the unique ultrastructural localization of PN-components and their interrelation with distinct pre- and postsynaptic MNTB cell structures. Therefore, we believe this work identifies the MNTB as an ideal system for studying PN function.

AB  - Dendritic spines provide a compartment for assembly and functional organization of synaptic machinery that plays a fundamental role in neuronal communication and neuroplasticity. Studies in humans as well as in animal models have demonstrated abnormal spine architecture in several psychiatric disorders, including depression and other stress-related illnesses. The negative impact of stress on the density and organization of spines is thought to contribute to the behavioral deficits caused by stress exposure. Moreover, there is now evidence that medication-induced recovery involves changes in synaptic plasticity and dendrite morphology, including increased expression of pre- and postsynaptic plasticity-related proteins, as well as the density and function of axo-spinous synapses. Here we review the evidence from brain imaging and postmortem studies demonstrating that depression is accompanied by structural and functional alterations of cortical and limbic brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. In addition, we present more direct evidence from basic research studies that exposure to stress alters spine morphology, function and plasticity and that antidepressants, particularly new rapid acting agents, reverse these effects. Elucidation of the signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms that control spine synapse assembly and plasticity will contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of depression and development of novel, more effective therapeutic agents.

AB  - Interactions between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are of major interest in the neurobiology of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders and are central to many experimental rodent models. Non-invasive imaging techniques offer a translatable approach to probing this system if homologous features can be identified across species. The objective of the present study was to systematically characterize the rat brain connectivity signature derived from low-frequency resting blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) oscillations associated with and within the hippocampal–prefrontal network, using an array of small seed locations within the relatively large anatomical structures comprising this system. A heterogeneous structure of functional connectivity, both between and within the hippocampal–prefrontal brain structures, was observed. In the hippocampal formation, the posterior (subiculum) region correlated more strongly than the anterior dorsal hippocampus with the PFC. A homologous relationship was found in the human hippocampus, with differential functional connectivity between hippocampal locations proximal to the fornix body relative to locations more distal being localized to the medial prefrontal regions in both species. The orbitofrontal cortex correlated more strongly with sensory cortices and a heterogeneous dependence of functional coupling on seed location was observed along the midline cingulate and retrosplenial cortices. These findings are all convergent with known anatomical connectivity, with stronger BOLD correlations corresponding to known monosynaptic connections. These functional connectivity relationships may provide a useful translatable probe of the hippocampal–prefrontal system for the further study of rodent models of disease and potential treatments, and inform electrode placement in electrophysiology to yield more precise descriptors of the circuits at risk in psychiatric disease.

AB  - Evidence is emerging for a role of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) in the form of stress granules, the unfolded protein response and protein bodies in the response of neurons to injury and in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we have studied the role of the peripheral target in regulating the RER and polyribosomes of Nissl bodies in axotomised adult cat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons where axonal regeneration and peripheral target reinnervation was either allowed or denied. Retrograde labelling with horseradish peroxidise was used as an independent marker to enable selection of only those DRG neuronal cell bodies with axons in the injured intercostal nerves. Indications of polyribosomal dispersal were seen by 6 h following axotomy, and by 24 h the normal orderly arrangement of lamellae of RER in Nissl bodies had become disorganised. These ultrastructural changes preceded light microscopical chromatolysis by 1–3 d. The retrograde response was maximal 8–32 d after axotomy. Clusters of debris-laden satellite cells/macrophages were present at this time but no ultrastructural evidence of neuronal apoptosis or necrosis was seen and there were no differences in the initial retrograde response according to the type of injury. By 64 d following axotomy with reinnervation, approximately half the labelled DRG neurons showed restoration of the orderly arrangement of RER and polyribosomes in their Nissl bodies. This was not seen after axotomy with reinnervation denied. We propose that the target-dependent changes in Nissl body ultrastructure described here are part of a continuum that can modify neuronal protein synthesis directed towards growth, maintenance or death of the neuron. This represents a possible structural basis for mediating the varied effects of neurotrophic interactions.

AB  - The goal of the present study was to examine how social subordination stress and 5HTT polymorphisms affect the development of brain serotonin (5HT) systems during the pubertal transition in female rhesus monkeys. We also examined associations with developmental changes in emotional reactivity in response to a standardized behavioral test, the Human Intruder (HI). Our findings provide the first longitudinal evidence of developmental increases in 5HT1A receptor and 5HTT binding in the brain of female primates from pre- to peripuberty. The increase in 5HT1A BPND in these socially housed female rhesus monkeys is a robust finding, occurring across all groups, regardless of social status or 5HTT genotype, and occurring in the left and right hemispheres of all prefrontal regions studied, as well as the amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and raphe nuclei. 5HTT BPND also showed an increase with age in raphe, anterior cingulate cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These changes in brain 5HT systems take place as females establish more adult-like patterns of social behavior, as well as during the HI paradigm. Indeed, the main developmental changes in behavior during the HI (increase in freezing and decrease in submission/appeasement) were related to neurodevelopmental increases in 5HT1A receptors and 5HTT, because the associations between these behaviors and 5HT endpoints emerge at peripuberty. We detected an effect of social status on 5HT1A BPND in the hypothalamus and on 5HTT BPND in the orbitofrontal cortex, with subordinates showing higher BPND than dominants in both cases during the pubertal transition. No main effects of 5HTT genotype were observed for 5HT1A or 5HTT BPND. Our findings indicate that adolescence in female rhesus monkeys is a period of central 5HT reorganization, partly influenced by exposure to the social stress of subordination, that likely functions to integrate adrenal and gonadal systems and shape the behavioral response to emotionally challenging social situations.

AB  - Background
Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a powerful pro-inflammatory mediator thought to play a significant role in the development of inflammation and pain. We investigated the role of CGRP in trigeminal inflammatory pain by determining the ability of a monoclonal antibody to CGRP to modify central Fos expression in response to stimulation of the inflamed ferret tooth pulp. We also assessed the effect of the antibody on pulpal inflammation.
Methods
Ten adult ferrets were prepared under anaesthesia to allow stimulation of the upper and lower left canine pulps, recording from the digastric muscle and intravenous injections at subsequent experiments. In all animals, pulpal inflammation was induced by introducing human caries into a deep buccal cavity. Four days later animals were treated intravenously with either CGRP antibody (n = 5) or vehicle (n = 5). After a further 2 days animals were re-anaesthetised and the tooth pulps stimulated at 10 times jaw-opening reflex threshold. Brainstems and tooth pulps were processed immunohistochemically for Fos and the common leucocyte marker CD45, respectively.
Results
Fos was expressed in ipsilateral trigeminal subnuclei caudalis (Vc) and oralis (Vo). Significantly fewer Fos-positive nuclei were present within Vc of CGRP antibody-treated animals (p = 0.003 vs vehicle-treated). Mean percentage area of staining for CD45 was significantly less in antibody-treated animals (p = 0.04 vs vehicle-treated).
Conclusions
This is the first direct evidence that sequestration of CGRP has anti-inflammatory and putative analgesic effects. Previous studies using this Fos model have demonstrated that it is able to predict clinical analgesic efficacy. Thus these data indicate that this antibody may have analgesic effects in dental pain and other types of inflammatory-mediated transmission, and suggest that this is in part due to peripheral anti-inflammatory effects.

It was possible that opioid-induced metabolomic changes in brain could mediate some of the pharmacodynamic effects of opioids. To investigate this, opiate-induced brain metabolomic responses were profiled using a semi-targeted method in C57BL/6 and 129Sv1 mice, which exhibit extreme differences in their tendency to become opiate dependent. Escalating morphine doses (10–40 mg/kg) administered over a 4-day period selectively induced a twofold decrease (p &lt; 0.00005) in adenosine abundance in the brainstem of C57BL/6 mice, which exhibited symptoms of narcotic drug dependence; but did not decrease adenosine abundance in 129Sv1 mice, which do not exhibit symptoms of dependence. Based on this finding, the effect of adenosine on dependence was investigated in genetically engineered mice with alterations in adenosine tone in the brain and in pharmacologic experiments. Morphine withdrawal behaviors were significantly diminished (p &lt; 0.0004) in genetically engineered mice with reduced adenosine tone in the brainstem, and by treatment with an adenosine receptor1 (A1) agonist (2-chloro-N6-cyclopentyladenosine, 0.5 mg/kg) or an A2a receptor (A2a) antagonist (SCH 58261, 1 mg/kg). These results indicate that adenosine homeostasis plays a crucial role in narcotic drug responses. Opiate-induced changes in brain adenosine levels may explain many important neurobehavioral features associated with opiate addiction and withdrawal.

AB  - To investigate the involvement of N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in local neocortical synaptic transmission, dual whole-cell recordings – combined with biocytin labelling – were obtained from bitufted adapting, multipolar adapting or multipolar non-adapting interneurons and pyramidal cells in layers II–V of rat (postnatal days 17–22) sensorimotor cortex. The voltage dependency of the amplitude of Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) received by the three types of interneuron appeared to coincide with the interneuron subclass; upon depolarisation, EPSPs received by multipolar non-adapting interneurons either decreased in amplitude or appeared insensitive, multipolar adapting interneuron EPSP amplitudes increased or appeared insensitive, whereas bitufted interneuron EPSP amplitudes increased or decreased. Connections were challenged with the NMDA receptor antagonist d-(−)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (d-AP5) (50 μM) revealing NMDA receptors to contribute to EPSPs received by all cell types, this also abolished the non-conventional voltage dependency. Reciprocal connections were frequent between pyramidal cells and multipolar interneurons, and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) elicited in pyramidal cells by both multipolar adapting and multipolar non-adapting interneurons were sensitive to a significant reduction in amplitude by d-AP5. The involvement of presynaptic NMDA receptors was indicated by coefficient of variation analysis and an increase in the failures of transmission. Furthermore, by loading MK-801 into the pre- or postsynaptic neurons, we observed that a reduction in inhibition requires presynaptic and not postsynaptic NMDA receptors. These results suggest that NMDA receptors possess pre- and postsynaptic roles at selective neocortical synapses that are probably important in governing spike-timing and information flow.

AB  - Early acoustic experience changes tonal frequency tuning in the inferior colliculus (IC) and the primary auditory cortex. The contributions of IC plasticity to cortical frequency map reorganization are not entirely clear. While most cortical plasticity studies exposed animals to pulsed tones, studies of IC plasticity used either noise or a continuous tone. Here we compared the effects of repeated exposure to single-frequency tone pips on cortical and IC frequency representations in juvenile rats. We found that while tone exposure caused a long-lasting increase in cortical representations of the exposure frequency, changes to IC neurons were limited to a transient narrowing of tuning bandwidth. These results suggest that previously documented cortical frequency map reorganization does not depend on similar changes in the subcortical auditory nuclei.

AB  - Failure of anterograde transport to distal targets in the brain is a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases. We have demonstrated in rodent models of glaucoma, the most common optic neuropathy, early loss of anterograde transport along the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) projection to the superior colliculus (SC) is retinotopic and followed by a period of persistence of RGC axon terminals and synapses through unknown molecular pathways. Here we use the DBA/2J mouse model of hereditary glaucoma and an acute rat model to demonstrate that retinotopically focal transport deficits in the SC are accompanied by a spatially coincident increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), especially in hypertrophic astrocytes. These neurochemical changes occur prior to loss of RGC synapses in the DBA/2J SC. In contrast to BDNF protein, levels of Bdnf mRNA decreased with transport failure, even as mRNA encoding synaptic structures remained unchanged. In situ hybridization signal for Bdnf mRNA was the strongest in SC neurons, and labeling for the immature precursor pro-BDNF was very limited. Subcellular fractionation of SC indicated that membrane-bound BDNF decreased with age in the DBA/2J, while BDNF released from vesicles remained high. These results suggest that in response to diminished axonal function, activated astrocytes in the brain may sequester mature BDNF released from target neurons to counter stressors that otherwise would challenge survival of projection synapses.

AB  - Small oligomeric beta amyloid (Aβ1–42) injected 45 min prior to single-trial bead discrimination training resulted in impaired learning in day-old chickens. A new experimental protocol was used where the injections of drugs were at times around the time of injection of Aβ. It was found that the Na+ levels of the saline used to dissolve Aβ affected cognitive impairment. Na+ levels above the normal plasma value (140 mM) reduced Aβ-induced learning deficits whereas levels below increased sensitivity to Aβ. The new protocol was also used to examine the ability of certain noradrenergic adrenoceptor antagonist and agonists, insulin, glucose and minocycline to reduce learning disruption caused by Aβ. The drugs (made up in 154 mM sodium chloride) were injected before, at the same time or after the injection of Aβ and although all drugs prevented Aβ-induced disruption of learning when given in the same injection as Aβ, some injected before could prevent Aβ disrupting learning, whereas others could rescue learning ability when given after Aβ injection. These results are interpreted in the light of possible actions of noradrenaline on microglia and various processes: astrocytic metabolism, cerebral microcirculation, and removal of Aβ away from the site of injection. The possible importance of hypernatremia and hyponatremia in the incidence of Alzheimer’s disease is discussed.

AB  - Approximately 50% of patients who survived after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) have cognitive or neurobehavioral dysfunction. The mechanisms are not known. NR2B, one of the subunits of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, has been proved to be an important factor for synapse function and behavior cognition. Experiment 1 aimed to investigate the timecourse of the NR2B expression in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum after SAH in rats. In experiment 2, we assessed the effect of Ro 25-6981 (a specific NR2B antagonist) on regulation of learning deficits and behavioral activity following SAH. All SAH animals were subjected to injection of autologous blood into the prechiasmatic cistern once on day 0. NR2B was assessed by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Cognitive and memory changes were investigated in the Morris water maze. As a result, the expression of NR2B was decreased remarkably in SAH groups compared with the control group and the low ebb was on days 1–3. The immunohistochemical staining demonstrated expression of NR2B was present mainly in the neurons in all of the three different regions, such as the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. After Ro 25-6981 intraperitoneal administration, learning deficits induced by SAH was markedly aggravated and clinical behavior scale was also significantly decreased. Our results suggest that NR2B expression is down-regulated in the brain after experimental SAH and NR2B antagonism resulted in augmentation of the development of cognitive dysfunction after SAH.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between head and trunk sway and between pelvis and leg sway during quiet stance in subjects with long-standing bilateral peripheral vestibular loss (BVLs) comparing these relationships to those of age-matched healthy controls (HCs). All subjects performed three different stance tasks: standing quietly on a firm or foam support surface, with eyes closed (ECF or eyes closed on normal) and on foam with eyes open. Data were recorded with four pairs of body-worn gyroscopes to measure roll and pitch angular velocities at the head, upper trunk, pelvis and lower-leg. These velocities were spectrally analysed and integrated for angle correlation analysis in three frequency bands: below 0.7 Hz (low pass, LP), above 3 Hz (high pass, HP) and in between (band pass, BP).

For both groups head motion was greater than trunk and pelvis motion except for BVL subjects (BVLs) under ECF conditions. BVLs had greater motion than HCs at all measurement locations for ECF conditions. Angle correlation analysis indicated that the head was almost “locked” to the trunk for BVLs over the LP and BP frequency bands. Head movements for both groups were relatively independent of the trunk in the HP band. Power spectral density ratios, and transfer functions showed a similar result – head relative to trunk movements were less up to 3 Hz in all tests for BVLs. The resonant frequency of head-on-trunk motion was shifted to a higher frequency for BVLs: from 3.2 to 4.3 Hz in pitch, 4.6 to 5.4 Hz in roll. Both groups show greater lower-leg than pelvis motion. These data indicate that during quiet stance BVLs change the characteristics of their head on shoulder motion, reducing relative motion of the head below 3 Hz and increasing head resonant frequency. Presumably these changes are accomplished with increased use of proprioceptive neck reflexes.

AB  - We have previously shown that the first-paced mating encounter increases the number of newborn cells in the granule cell layer (Gra; also known as internal cell layer, ICL) of the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) in the adult female rat (Corona et al., 2011). In the present study we evaluated if repetition of the stimulus (paced mating) could increase the arrival of more newborn neurons in the olfactory bulb generated during the first session of paced sexual contact. Sexually naive female rats were bilaterally ovariectomized, hormonally supplemented with estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) and randomly assigned to one of four groups: (1) without sexual contact, (2) one session of paced mating, (3) four sessions of paced mating, and (4) four sessions of non-paced mating. We also included a group of gonadally intact females. On the first day of the experiment, all females were i.p. injected with the marker of DNA synthesis bromodeoxyuridine and were killed 16 days later. Blood was collected at sacrifice to determine the plasma levels of E2 and P. The number of newborn neurons that arrived at the ICL of the AOB and the Gra of the main olfactory bulb (MOB) increased, relative to all other groups, only in the group that repeatedly mated under pacing conditions. No differences were found in E2 and P levels between supplemented groups indicating that our results are not influenced by changes in hormone concentrations. We suggest that repeated paced mating promotes the arrival of more newborn neurons in the AOB and MOB.

AB  - Studies on the neuritis model suggest that in many patients with neuropathic pain, symptoms may be due to nerve inflammation rather than frank nerve injury. Treatments for these patients are often ineffective. The neuroprotective and hematopoietic agent erythropoietin (EPO) has been shown to reverse pain behaviors in nerve injury models and therefore may be of therapeutic benefit. However, EPO can cause thrombosis. ARA290 is an analog of EPO that has the neuroprotective activities of EPO without stimulating hematopoiesis. The present study has examined the effects of ARA290 on pain behavior in the neuritis model. Following neuritis induction, 30 or 120 μg/kg ARA290 or saline vehicle was injected intraperitoneally into rats daily from day 1 post surgery. Animals were assessed for mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia. Levels of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and chemokine (CC motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) mRNA were also assessed using polymerase chain reaction. Vehicle-treated neuritis animals (n = 20) developed signs of mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia that reached a maximum on day 4 and 3 of testing, respectively. Treatment with either 30 (n = 11) or 120 μg/kg ARA290 (n = 9) prevented the development of mechanical allodynia. However, ARA290 did not significantly affect heat hyperalgesia. There was no significant difference between the effects of each drug dose (p &lt; 0.05, unpaired t test comparing area under the curve for mechanical allodynia). The levels of CCL2 and TNF-α mRNA in the nerve and Gelfoam were not significantly different following 120 μg/kg ARA290 treatment (n = 3–7) compared to vehicle-treated animals (n = 3–7; p = 0.24; unpaired t tests). In summary, ARA290 may be beneficial in the treatment of neuropathic pain symptoms where signs of nerve injury are absent on clinical assessment. The mechanisms of action do not appear to involve the inhibition of TNF-α or CCL2 production.

AB  - Neuronal electrical activity has been known to affect the viability of neurons in the central nervous system. Here we show that long-lasting membrane depolarization induced by elevated extracellular K+ recruits nitric oxide (NO)/soluble guanylyl cyclase/protein kinase G signaling pathway, induces 8-nitroguanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-nitro-cGMP)-mediated protein S-guanylation, and confers dopaminergic neuroprotection. Treatment of primary mesencephalic cell cultures with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) for 72 h decreased the number of dopaminergic neurons, whereas the cell loss was markedly inhibited by elevated extracellular concentration of K+ (+40 mM). The neuroprotective effect of elevated extracellular K+ was significantly attenuated by tetrodotoxin (a Na+ channel blocker), amlodipine (a voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel blocker), Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) (a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor), 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) (a soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor), and KT5823 or Rp-8-bromo-β-phenyl-1,N2-ethenoguanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate (Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS) (protein kinase G inhibitors). Elevated extracellular K+ increased 8-nitro-cGMP production resulting in the induction of protein S-guanylation in cells in mesencephalic cultures including dopaminergic neurons. In addition, exogenous application of 8-nitro-cGMP protected dopaminergic neurons from MPP+ cytotoxicity, which was prevented by zinc protoporphyrin IX, an inhibitor of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Zinc protoporphyrin IX also inhibited the neuroprotective effect of elevated extracellular K+. On the other hand, KT5823 or Rp-8-Br-PET-cGMPS did not inhibit the induction of HO-1 protein expression by 8-nitro-cGMP, although these protein kinase G inhibitors abrogated the neuroprotective effect of 8-nitro-cGMP. These results suggest that protein S-guanylation (leading to HO-1 induction) as well as canonical protein kinase G signaling pathway plays an important role in NO-mediated, activity-dependent dopaminergic neuroprotection.

AB  - Three point mutations in the SNCA gene encoding α-synuclein (aSyn) have been associated with autosomal dominant forms of Parkinson’s disease. To better understand the role of the A30P mutant aSyn, we compared two transgenic mouse strains: a knock-in mouse with an introduced A30P point mutation in the wild-type (WT) gene (Sncatm(A30P)) and a transgenic (Tg) mouse overexpressing the human A30P aSyn gene under the prion promoter [tg(Prnp-SNCA∗A30P)]. The brain aSyn load, motor performance, brain dopamine (DA) and sensitivity to 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) were studied in these mice. aSyn was evidently accumulating with age in all mice, particularly in tg(Prnp-SNCA∗A30P) Tg mice. There were no robust changes in basal locomotor activities of the mice of either line at 6 months, but after 1 year, tg(Prnp-SNCA∗A30P) Tg mice developed severe problems with vertical movements. However, the younger Tg mice had a reduced locomotor response to 1 mg/kg of d-amphetamine. Sncatm(A30P) mice with the targeted mutation (Tm) were slightly hyperactive at all ages. Less 6-OHDA was required in tg(Prnp-SNCA∗A30P) Tg (1 μg) than in WT (3 μg) mice for an ipsilateral rotational bias by d-amphetamine. That was not seen with the Sncatm(A30P) strain. A small dose of 6-OHDA (0.33 μg) led to contralateral rotations and elevated striatal DA in Tg/Tm mice of both lines but otherwise 6-OHDA-induced striatal DA depletion was similar in all mice, indicating no A30P-aSyn-related toxin sensitivity. 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid/DA-ratio was elevated in tg(Prnp-SNCA∗A30P) mice, suggesting an enhanced DA turnover. This ratio and homovanillic acid/DA-ratio were declined in Sncatm(A30P) mice. Our results demonstrate that the two differently constructed A30P-aSyn mouse strains have distinct behavioral and biochemical characteristics, some of which are opposite. Since the two lines with the same background were not identically produced, the deviations found may be partially caused by factors other than aSyn-related genetic differences.

AB  - There is accumulating evidence that glutamate and GABA release are key mechanisms of ischaemic events in the CNS. However, data on the expression of involved transporters for these mediators are inconsistent, potentially impeding further neuroprotective approaches. Here, we applied immunofluorescence labelling to characterise the expression pattern of vesicular glutamate (VGLUT) and GABA transporters (VGAT) after acute focal cerebral ischaemia and in two models of retinal ischaemia. Mice were subjected to filament-based focal cerebral ischaemia predominantly involving the middle cerebral artery territory, also leading to retinal ischaemia due to central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). Alternatively, retinal ischaemia was induced by a transient increase of the intraocular pressure (HIOP). One day after ischaemia onset, diminished immunolabelling of neuronal nuclei and microtubule-associated protein 2-positive structures were found in the ipsilateral neocortex, subcortex and the retina, indicating neuronal degeneration. VGLUT1 expression did not change significantly in ischaemic tissues whereas VGLUT2 was down-regulated in specific areas of the brain. VGLUT3 expression was only slightly down-regulated in the ischaemia-affected neocortex, and was found to form clusters on fibrils of unknown origin in the ischaemic lateral hypothalamus. In contrast, retinae subjected to CRAO or HIOP displayed a rapid loss of VGLUT3-immunoreactivity. The expression of VGAT appears resistant to ischaemia as there was no significant alteration in all the regions analysed. In summary, these data indicate a region- and subtype-specific change of VGLUT expression in the ischaemia-affected CNS, whose consideration might help to generate specific neuroprotective strategies.

AB  - The effects of the steroid hormone 17β-estradiol and the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on neuronal physiology have been well investigated. Numerous studies have demonstrated that each signal can exert powerful influences on the structure and function of synapses, and specifically on dendritic spines, both within short and long time frames. Moreover, it has been suggested that BDNF is required for the long-term, or genomic, actions of 17β-estradiol on dendritic spines, via its ability to regulate the expression of neurotrophins. Here we focus on the acute, or rapid effects, of 17β-estradiol and BDNF, and their ability to activate specific signalling cascades, resulting in alterations in dendritic spine morphology. We first review recent literature describing the mechanisms by which 17β-estradiol activates these pathways, and the resulting alterations in dendritic spine number. We then describe the molecular mechanisms underlying acute modulation of dendritic spine morphology by BDNF. Finally, we consider how this new evidence may suggest that the temporal interactions of 17β-estradiol and BDNF can occur more rapidly than previously reported. Building on these new data, we propose a novel model for the interactions of this steroid and neurotrophin, whereby rapid, non-genomic 17β-estradiol and acute BDNF signal in a co-operative manner, resulting in dendritic spine formation and subsequent stabilization in support of synapse and circuit plasticity. This extended hypothesis suggests an additional mechanism by which these two signals may modulate dendritic spines in a time-specific manner.

AB  - Hyperpolarization-activated currents (Ih) affect multiple neuronal functions including membrane potential, intrinsic firing properties, synaptic integration and frequency-dependent resonance behavior. Consistently, Ih plays a key role for oscillations at the cellular and network level, including theta and gamma oscillations in rodent hippocampal circuits. Little is known, however, about the contribution of Ih to a prominent memory-related pattern of network activity called sharp-wave-ripple complexes (SPW-R). Here we report that pharmacological suppression of Ih induces specific changes in SPW-R in mouse hippocampal slices depending on the specific drug used and the region analyzed. Spontaneous generation of the events was reduced by blocking Ih whereas the amplitude was unaffected or increased. Interestingly, the superimposed ripple oscillations at ∼200 Hz persisted with unchanged frequency, indicating that Ih is not critical for generating this rhythmic pattern. Likewise, coupling between field oscillations and units was unchanged, showing unaltered recruitment of neurons into oscillating assemblies. Control experiments exclude a contribution of T-type calcium channels to the observed effects. Together, we report a specific contribution of hyperpolarization-activated cation currents to the generation of sharp waves in the hippocampus.

AB  - 17ß-Estradiol and progesterone exert a number of physiological effects throughout the brain due to interactions with several types of receptors belonging to the traditional family of intracellular hormonal receptors as well as to membrane-bound receptors. In particular, both hormones elicit rapid modifications of neuronal excitability that have been postulated to underlie their effects on synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. Likewise, both hormones have been shown to be neuroprotective under certain conditions, possibly due to the activation of pro-survival pathways and the inhibition of pro-apoptotic cascades. Because of the similarities in their cellular effects, there have been a number of questions raised by numerous observations that progesterone inhibits the effects of estrogen. In this manuscript, we first review the interactions between 17ß-estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) in synaptic plasticity, and conclude that, while E2 exerts a clear and important role in long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons, the role of P4 is much less clear, and could be accounted by the direct or indirect regulation of GABAA receptors. We then discuss the neuroprotective roles of both hormones, in particular against excitotoxicity. In this case, the neuroprotective effects of these hormones are very similar to those of the neurotrophic factor BDNF. Interestingly, P4 antagonizes the effects of E2, possibly through the regulation of estrogen receptors or of proteins associated with the receptors or interactions with signaling pathways activated by E2. Overall, this review emphasizes the existence of common molecules and pathways that participate in the regulation of both synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration.

AB  - The aim of this study was to comparatively study cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) and c-Fos regulation by morphine in the brains of Lewis and Fischer 344 (F344) rats, which are known to differ in their behavioral sensitivities to several drugs of abuse. Two hours after an acute i.p. administration of morphine (10 mg kg−1) or saline (control), the animals were perfused and their brains prepared for immunohistochemistry. The number of CDK5 immunoreactive cells was significantly higher in the nucleus accumbens (NAC), the locus coeruleus (LC) and the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) of saline-injected F344 rats than in those of the Lewis rats. Morphine upregulated CDK5 with a varying pattern depending on the strain and brain area. The effect of the opioid was more marked in the NTS of the Lewis rats and the NAC of the F344 rats. Immunostaining of c-Fos was very low or absent in the control animals and was consistently up-regulated by morphine, especially in the LC and NTS of the F344 rats and the NAC of the Lewis rats. We propose that the acute morphine regulation of CDK5 expression in the NAC may predict the rate of drug intake and/or extinction of drug seeking, while the pattern of c-Fos activation may be more related to the differential acquisition of morphine-seeking behaviors.

AB  - In adult mammals, newborn neural precursor cells (NPCs) derived from either the subventricular zone (SVZ) or the subgranular zone (SGZ) migrate into the olfactory bulb and the dentate gyrus (DG), respectively, where some of them mature into excitatory and inhibitory neurons. There is increasing evidence that this neurogenesis process is important for some types of learning and synaptic plasticity and vice versa. Survivin, a member of the inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein (IAP) family, has been suggested to have a central role in the regulation of neurogenesis. The protein is abundantly expressed in nervous tissue during embryonic development while being restricted postnatally to proliferating and migrating NPCs in SVZ and SGZ. Here we examined adult SurvivinCamcre mice with a conditional deletion of the survivin gene in embryonic neurogenic regions. Although the deletion of survivin had no effect on basic excitability in DG and CA1-region, there was a marked impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP) in these areas. Our data support a function of survivin in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and learning and underline the importance of adult brain neurogenesis for proper operation of the hippocampal tri-synaptic circuit and the physiological functions that depend on it.

AB  - Rett syndrome (RTT) is a disorder with a pronounced neurological phenotype and is caused mainly by mutations in the X-linked gene MECP2. A common feature of RTT is an abnormal electroencephalography and a propensity for seizures. In the current study we aimed to assess brain network excitability and seizure propensity in a mouse model of RTT. Mice in which Mecp2 expression was silenced (Mecp2stop/y) showed a higher seizure score (mean = 6 ± 0.8 compared to 4 ± 0.2 in wild-type [WT]) and more rapid seizure onset (median onset = 10 min in Mecp2stop/y and 32 min in WT) when challenged with the convulsant drug kainic acid (25 mg/kg). Hippocampal slices from Mecp2stop/y brain displayed no spontaneous field potential activities under control conditions but showed higher power gamma frequency field potential oscillations compared to WT in response to kainic acid (400 nM) in vitro. Brain slices challenged with the GABAA-receptor antagonist bicuculline (0.1–10 μM) and the potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (1–50 μM) also revealed differences between genotypes with hippocampal circuits from Mecp2stop/y mouse slices showing enhanced epileptiform burst duration and frequency. In contrast to these network level findings, single cell analysis of pyramidal cells by whole-cell patch clamp recording revealed no detectable differences in synaptic or biophysical properties between methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2)-containing and MeCP2-deficient neurons. These data support the proposal that loss of MeCP2 alters network level excitability in the brain to promote epileptogenesis.

AB  - Painful small-fiber peripheral neuropathy is a debilitating complication of chronic alcohol abuse. Evidence from previous studies suggests that neuroendocrine mechanisms, in combination with other, as yet unidentified actions of alcohol, are required to produce this neuropathic pain syndrome. In addition to neurotoxic effects of alcohol, in the setting of alcohol abuse neuroendocrine stress axes release glucocorticoids and catecholamines. Since receptors for these stress hormones are located on nociceptors, at which they can act to cause neuronal dysfunction, we tested the hypothesis that alcohol and stress hormones act on the nociceptor, independently, to produce neuropathic pain. We used a rat model, which allows the distinction of the effects of alcohol from those produced by neuroendocrine stress axis mediators. We now demonstrate that topical application of alcohol and exposure to unpredictable sound stress, each alone, has no effect on the nociceptive threshold. However, when animals that had previous exposure to alcohol were subsequently exposed to stress, they rapidly developed mechanical hyperalgesia. Conversely, sound stress followed by topical alcohol exposure also produced mechanical hyperalgesia. The contribution of stress hormones was prevented by spinal intrathecal administration of oligodeoxynucleotides antisense to β2-adrenergic or glucocorticoid receptor mRNA, which attenuates receptor level in nociceptors, as well as by adrenal medullectomy. These experiments establish an independent role of alcohol and stress hormones on the primary afferent nociceptor in the induction of painful peripheral neuropathy.

AB  - Angiotensins (Angs) modulate blood pressure, hydro-electrolyte composition, and antinociception. Although Ang (5–8) has generally been considered to be inactive, we show here that Ang (5–8) was the smallest Ang to elicit dose-dependent responses and receptor-mediated antinociception in the rat ventrolateral periaqueductal gray matter (vlPAG). Ang (5–8) antinociception seems to be selective, because it did not alter blood pressure or act on vascular or intestinal smooth muscle cells. The non-selective Ang-receptor (Ang-R) antagonist saralasin blocked Ang (5–8) antinociception, but selective antagonists of Ang-R types I, II, IV, and Mas did not, suggesting that Ang (5–8) may act via an unknown receptor. Endopeptidase EP 24.11 and amastatin-sensitive aminopeptidase from the vlPAG catalyzed the synthesis (from Ang II or Ang III) and inactivation of Ang (5–8), respectively. Selective inhibitors of neuronal-nitric oxide (NO) synthase, soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) and a non-selective opioid receptor (opioid-R) inhibitor blocked Ang (5–8)-induced antinociception. In conclusion, Ang (5–8) is a new member of the Ang family that selectively and strongly modulates antinociception via NO–sGC and endogenous opioid in the vlPAG.

AB  - The basolateral nuclear complex of the amygdala (BLC) receives dense noradrenergic/norepinephrine (NE) inputs from the locus coeruleus that play a key role in modulating emotional memory consolidation. Knowledge of the extent of synapse formation by NE inputs to the BLC, as well as the cell types innervated, would contribute to an understanding of how NE modulates the activity of the BLC. To gain a better understanding of NE circuits in the BLC, dual-label immunohistochemistry was used at the light and electron microscopic levels in the present study to analyze NE axons and their innervation of pyramidal cells in the anterior subdivision of the basolateral amygdalar nucleus (BLa). NE axons and BLa pyramidal cells were labeled using antibodies to the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK), respectively. Dual localization studies using antibodies to NET and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) revealed that virtually all NE axons and varicosities expressed both proteins. The BLa exhibited a medium density of NET+ fibers. Ultrastructural analysis of serial section reconstructions of NET+ axons revealed that only about half of NET+ terminals formed synapses. The main postsynaptic targets were small-caliber CAMK+ dendritic shafts and spines of pyramidal cells. A smaller number of NET+ terminals formed synapses with unlabeled cell bodies and dendrites. These findings indicate that the distal dendritic domain of BLa pyramidal cells is the major target of NE terminals in the BLa, and the relatively low synaptic incidence suggests that diffusion from non-synaptic terminals may be important for noradrenergic modulation of the BLa.

AB  - Hyperexcitability of dorsal horn neurons has been shown to play a key role in neuropathic pain following chronic experimental spinal cord injury. With a neonatal in vitro spinal cord injury model, we show that a chemically-induced lesion leads to rapid gain-of-function of sublesional dorsal horn networks biased to hyperexcitation. The expression of the GABA synthetic enzyme GAD65 was significantly reduced at the same level of the spinal cord, suggesting a compromised inhibitory system. We propose that our model could be useful to test early approaches to contrast spinal cord injury-induced central sensitization of dorsal horn circuits.

AB  - With the exception of parturition and lactation, male California deer mice (Peromyscus californicus) exhibit the same parental responses toward offspring as conspecific females. A closely related species, Peromyscus maniculatus, however, rarely exhibits paternal responses. In the current study, a comparative species approach was used to assess paternal responses in both Peromyscus species with varying levels of paternal experience (biological fathers, pup-exposed virgins, and pup-naïve virgins). Of special interest was the persistence of the males to direct their attention toward a distressed pup housed in a small enclosure (i.e., a barrier existed between males and pups). In addition to pup-directed responses, non-pup-directed responses such as grooming, resting and jumping were recorded. Subsequently, all animals’ brains were assessed for fos-immunoreactivity (ir) in several areas previously associated with the paternal brain circuit. Overall, P. californicus exhibited more pup-directed responses as well as less fos-ir in brain areas involved in emotional integration and processing such as the insula and anterior cingulate. In addition to increased activation of emotional regulatory areas, P. maniculatus males, observed to direct their behavior away from the pup, exhibited higher fos-ir in the nucleus accumbens (involved in goal acquisition), perhaps due to a heightened motivation to avoid the pups. Interestingly, experience with pups altered the lateral septum and amygdala activation of P. maniculatus to levels similar to P. californicus biological fathers. Finally, fos-ir was increased in the medial preoptic area, involved in the maintenance of maternal behavior, in the biological fathers of both species. Thus, although biological predispositions toward pup-directed behaviors were observed in P. californicus males, evidence of a few shifts toward the paternal neural activation profile was apparent in P. maniculatus males. Specifically, modifications in fear responses and social processing may represent the cornerstones of the gradual shift from social tentativeness to social attentiveness in the presence of pups.

AB  - We tested a hypothesis that the classical relation between movement time and index of difficulty (ID) in quick pointing action (Fitts’ Law) reflects processes at the level of motor planning. Healthy subjects stood on a force platform and performed quick and accurate hand movements into targets of different size located at two distances. The movements were associated with early postural adjustments that are assumed to reflect motor planning processes. The short distance did not require trunk rotation, while the long distance did. As a result, movements over the long distance were associated with substantial Coriolis forces. Movement kinematics and contact forces and moments recorded by the platform were studied. Movement time scaled with ID for both movements. However, the data could not be fitted with a single regression: Movements over the long distance had a larger intercept corresponding to movement times about 140 ms longer than movements over the shorter distance. The magnitude of postural adjustments prior to movement initiation scaled with ID for both short and long distances. Our results provide strong support for the hypothesis that Fitts’ Law emerges at the level of motor planning, not at the level of corrections of ongoing movements. They show that, during natural movements, changes in movement distance may lead to changes in the relation between movement time and ID, for example when the contribution of different body segments to the movement varies and when the action of Coriolis force may require an additional correction of the movement trajectory.

AB  - Loss of function mutations in THAP1 has been associated with primary generalized and focal dystonia in children and adults. THAP1 encodes a transcription factor (THAP1) that harbors an atypical zinc finger domain and plays a critical role in G1-S cell cycle control. Current thinking suggests that dystonia may be a neurodevelopmental circuit disorder. Hence, THAP1 may participate in the development of the nervous system. Herein, we report the neurodevelopmental expression patterns of Thap1 transcript and THAP1 protein from the early postnatal period through adulthood in the rat brain, spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRG). We detected Thap1 transcript and THAP1-immunoreactivity (IR) in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, striatum, substantia nigra, thalamus, spinal cord and DRG. Thap1 transcript expression was higher in the brain than in spinal cord and DRG at P1 and P7 and declined to similar levels at P14 and later time points in all regions except the cerebellum, where it remained high through adulthood. In the brain, THAP1 expression was highest in early development, particularly in the cerebellum at P7. In addition to Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, THAP1-IR was also localized to pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex, relay neurons in the thalamus, medium spiny and cholinergic neurons in the striatum, dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and pyramidal and interneurons in the hippocampus. In the cerebellar cortex, THAP1-IR was prominently distributed in the perikarya and proximal dendrites of Purkinje cells at early time-points. In contrast, it was more diffusely distributed throughout the dendritic arbor of adult Purkinje cells producing a moderate diffuse staining pattern in the molecular layer. At all time points, nuclear IR was weaker than cytoplasmic IR. The prominent cytoplasmic and developmentally regulated expression of THAP1 suggests that THAP1 may function as part of a cell surface-nucleus signaling cascade involved in terminal neural differentiation.

AB  - Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) inhibitors administered prior to or immediately after experimental stroke confer acute neuroprotection. However, it remains unclear if delayed treatment with a PTEN inhibitor improves long-term functional recovery after stroke. We addressed the issue in this study. Adult male mice were subjected to 1 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by treatment with a well-established PTEN inhibitor BPV or saline daily for 14 days, starting at 24 h after MCAO. Functional recovery was assessed with behavioral tests and acute infarct volumes were analyzed histologically. Delayed BPV treatment did not reduce infarction during the acute phase, but significantly improved long-term functional recovery after MCAO. Since PTEN is a critical intrinsic inhibitory factor in axonal regeneration, we further examined BPV effects on axonal densities following MCAO using bielschowsky silver staining and immunohistochemistry with antibodies against myelin basic protein. Delayed BPV treatment significantly increased axon densities in the ischemic brain at 14 days after MCAO. Moreover, PTEN expression persistently remained high in the ischemic brain over 14 days after MCAO, and BPV treatment increased post-ischemic activation of Akt and mTOR in the ischemic brain. Akt and mTOR activation are the well-established cascades downstream to PTEN inhibition and have been shown to contribute to post-injury axonal regrowth in response to PTEN inhibition. Consistently, in an in vitro neuronal ischemia model, BPV enhanced axonal outgrowth of primary cortical neurons after oxygen-glucose deprivation and the enhancing effects were abolished by Akt/mTOR inhibition. In conclusion, delayed BPV treatment improved functional recovery from experimental stroke possibly via enhancing axonal growth and Akt/mTOR activation contributed to BPV-enhanced post-stroke axon growth.

AB  - This study was designed to examine the effects of chronic running exercise (Ex) on the hypobaric hypoxia-induced neuronal injury in the hippocampus. Male Wistar rats (9 weeks old) were caged in a hypoxic altitude chamber simulating the condition of 9000 m high (0.303 atm) for 7 h and the brains were examined at 0, 4, and 24 h after treatment. Hypoxia challenge increased the levels of caspase 3 (mean ± SEM, % of baseline control, 121.9 ± 11.8, 152.3 ± 15.3, 141.6 ± 7.0 for 0, 4 and 24 h, respectively, n = 5) and induced apoptosis (cell number, 205.7 ± 8.8, 342.3 ± 33.4, 403.0 ± 12.2 for 0, 4 and 24 h vs. 7.7 ± 1.4 baseline control, n = 3) in the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. The expression levels (% of control for 0, 4 and 24 h, respectively, n = 5) of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α; 150.5 ± 8.1, 176.7 ± 11.1, 136.2 ± 13.3), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS; 163.4 ± 9.6, 194.5 ± 13.6, 163.7 ± 10.9) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS; 139.4 ± 9.5, 169.2 ± 13.3, 134.3 ± 13.0) and the degrees of microglia (cell number, 255.3 ± 48.2, 349.0 ± 57.3, 433.7 ± 42.4 vs. 57.7 ± 13.0 baseline control, n = 3) and astrocyte (150.0 ± 9.7, 199.3 ± 10.8, 154.2 ± 4.7) activation were increased by the hypoxia treatment, indicating that the brain was under hypoxic, oxidative and inflammatory stresses. Furthermore, the protein levels of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; 76.0 ± 2.5, 76.1 ± 7.1, 69.3 ± 1.7 for 0, 4 and 24 h, respectively, mean % of control ± SEM, n = 5) were reduced by the hypoxia treatment. Four weeks of treadmill Ex before hypoxia treatment significantly reduced the hypoxia-induced apoptosis (p &lt; 0.001, n = 3) in the hippocampal CA1 neurons. Ex decreased the hypoxia-induced elevations of HIF-1α (p &lt; 0.001, n = 5), nNOS (p &lt; 0.001, n = 5) and iNOS (p &lt; 0.001, n = 5) levels and activation of microglia (p = 0.005, n = 3) and astrocyte (p &lt; 0.001, n = 5) status; whereas the hypoxia-reduced BDNF protein levels (p = 0.013, n = 5) were restored. Taken together, our results show that chronic Ex protects hippocampal CA1 neurons against hypobaric hypoxia insult. Ex-enhanced bioenergetic adaptation and anti-oxidative capacity may prevent neurons from hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, activation of the BDNF signaling pathway may be involved in the Ex-induced protection.

AB  - Nodal-related protein, Ndr2, and transcription factors such as Lmx1b, Otp, Nurr1 and Pitx3 are very important in the differentiation, function and maintenance of mesodiencephalic dopaminergic neurons, and are necessary for the activation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine (DA) transporter expression. Hence, the aim of the present work was to evaluate the effects of cocaine on the expression of genes related to the embryogenesis development of the dopaminergic system. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to cocaine hydrochloride at 5 h post-fertilization (hpf), and collected at two important stages – 24 and 48 hpf – to study the effects of cocaine on the expression of ndr2, the lmx1b.1, lmx1b.2, otpa, otpb, nurr1 transcription factors, and their target genes: TH and DA transporter expression. Our results by qPCR showed that cocaine affects the expression of these genes in different ways, depending on the stage of development. Furthermore by in situ hybridization we observed a change in the spatial distribution of lmx1b.1 and lmx1b.2 at both stages (24 and 48 hpf) due to exposure to cocaine.

We also show the importance of Lmx1b and Otp in th expression through the knockdown of Lmx1b.1 and Lmx1b.2, and of Otpa and Otpb. Additionally, cocaine produced an increase and a decrease in TH levels at 24 and at 48 hpf, respectively, possibly due to the change in the expression of the transcription factors and ndr2 expression.

We conclude that cocaine alters the correct development of dopaminergic system affecting the expression of transcription factors, during the embryogenesis.

AB  - Neurons within the superficial dorsal horn (SDH) of the rodent spinal cord exhibit distinct firing properties during early life. While this may reflect a unique combination of voltage-gated Na+ (Nav) and voltage-independent (i.e. “leak’’) K+ channels which strongly influence neuronal excitability across the CNS, surprisingly little is known about which genes encoding for Nav and leak K+ channels are expressed within developing spinal pain circuits. The goal of the present study was therefore to characterize the transcriptional expression of these channels within the rat SDH at postnatal days (P) 3, 10, 21 or adulthood using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results demonstrate that Nav isoforms are developmentally regulated at the mRNA level in a subtype-specific manner, as Nav1.2 and Nav1.3 decreased significantly from P3 to adulthood, while Nav1.1 was up-regulated during this period. The data also indicate selective, age-dependent changes in the mRNA expression of two-pore domain (K2P) K+ channels, as TWIK-related acid-sensitive K+ channels TASK-1 (KCNK3) and TASK-3 (KCNK9) were down-regulated during postnatal development in the absence of any changes in the tandem of pore domains in a weak inward rectifying K+ channel (TWIK) isoforms examined (KCNK1 and KCNK6). In addition, a developmental shift occurred within the TREK subfamily due to decreased TREK-2 (KCNK10) mRNA within the mature SDH. Meanwhile, G-protein-coupled inward rectifying K+ channels (Kir3.1 and Kir3.2) were expressed in the SDH at mature levels from birth. Overall, the results suggest that the transcription of ion channel genes occurs in a highly age-dependent manner within the SDH, raising the possibility that manipulating the expression or function of ion channels which are preferentially expressed within immature nociceptive networks could yield novel approaches to relieving pain in infants and children.

AB  - Opioid mechanisms are involved in the control of water and NaCl intake and opioid receptors (ORs) are present in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), a site of important facilitatory mechanisms related to the control of sodium appetite. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the effects of the activation of μ-ORs in the CeA on 0.3 M NaCl and water intake in rats. Male Sprague–Dawley rats with stainless steel cannulas implanted bilaterally in the CeA were used. In rats submitted to water deprivation–partial rehydration, bilateral injections of the selective μ-OR agonist [D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) in the doses of 1, 2, and 4 nmol into the CeA induced a dose-related increase of 0.3 M NaCl intake and water intake, and bilateral injections of the selective μ-OR antagonist D-Phe-Cys-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2 (CTAP) in the doses of 0.5, 1, and 2 nmol into the CeA produced a dose-related decrease of 0.3 M NaCl and water intake induced by DAMGO 2 nmol into the same site. In rats treated with the diuretic furosemide (10 mg/kg b.w.) combined with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (5 mg/kg b.w.) injected subcutaneously, bilateral injections of DAMGO 2 nmol into the CeA increased 0.3 M NaCl intake and water intake and the blockade of μ-ORs with CTAP 1 nmol injected into the CeA reduced the increase in 0.3 M NaCl intake and water intake induced by DAMGO 2 nmol into the same site. Bilateral injections of DAMGO into the CeA did not change urinary volume, sodium urinary excretion and mean arterial pressure, but increased activity. Thus stimulating μ-ORs in the CeA increases hypertonic sodium intake, whereas antagonizing these sites inhibits hypertonic sodium intake. Together, our results implicate μ-ORs in the CeA in a positive regulation of sodium intake.

AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an asymmetric neurodegenerative disorder, and secondary adaptive mechanisms of the less-affected side could potentially compensate for parkinsonian symptoms. Here, we analyzed gene expression changes on the healthy side of a unilateral PD rat model and correlated these changes with locomotor velocity, which is known to be decreased in PD. Four weeks after a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion, the spontaneous locomotor velocity of rats was recorded just prior to brain extraction. We then analyzed the gene expression levels of markers of the direct (dynorphin and D1-class dopamine receptors) and indirect (enkephalin and D2-class dopamine receptors) pathways in the contralateral healthy striatum by in situ hybridization histochemistry. In addition, we analyzed the expression of several striatal and cortical glutamatergic markers, as well as nigral tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and nigral dopamine transporter (DAT). We found a significant positive correlation between the mRNA expression levels of contralateral D1-class dopamine receptors and the mean locomotor velocity, at 4 weeks after surgery in parkinsonian rats but not in controls. Moreover, we observed a significant increase in the level of dynorphin mRNA in the lateral part of the contralateral striatum of parkinsonian rats compared to the controls. In contrast, no contralateral changes were observed in the striatal indirect pathway. We also did not find any significant contralateral modifications of TH, DAT or glutamatergic markers in PD animals, indicating that changes in direct pathway genes are not due to nigrostriatal dopaminergic or corticostriatal glutamatergic innervation. In conclusion, our results suggest a role of the healthy striatal direct pathway in counteracting dopaminergic denervation effects on motor symptoms.

AB  - Elevated ethanol use during adolescence, a potentially stressful developmental period, is accompanied by insensitivity to many aversive effects of ethanol relative to adults. Given evidence that supports a role for stress and the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) system in mediating aversive properties of ethanol and other drugs, the present study assessed the role of KOR antagonism by nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI) on ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion (CTA) in stressed (exposed to repeated restraint) and non-stressed male rats (Experiment 1), with half of the rats pretreated with nor-BNI before stressor exposure. In Experiment 2, CTA induced by the kappa agonist U62,066 was also compared in stressed and non-stressed adolescents and adults. A highly palatable solution (chocolate Boost) was used as the conditioned stimulus (CS), thereby avoiding the need for water deprivation to motivate consumption of the CS during conditioning. No effects of stress on ethanol-induced CTA were found, with all doses eliciting aversions in adolescents and adults in both stress conditions. However, among stressed subjects, adults given nor-BNI before the repeated stressor displayed blunted ethanol aversion relative to adults given saline at that time. This effect of nor-BNI was not seen in adolescents, findings that support a differential role for the KOR involvement in ethanol CTA in stressed adolescents and adults. Results from Experiment 2 revealed that all doses of U62,066 elicited aversions in non-stressed animals of both ages that were attenuated in stressed animals, findings that support a modulatory role for stress in aversive effects of KOR activation. Collectively, these results suggest that although KOR sensitivity appears to be reduced in stressed subjects, this receptor system does not appear to contribute to age differences in ethanol-induced CTA under the present test circumstances.

AB  - The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the steroid hormone estrogen exhibit potent effects on hippocampal neurons during development and in adulthood. BDNF and estrogen have also been implicated in the etiology of diverse types of neurological disorders or psychiatric illnesses, or have been discussed as potentially important in treatment. Although both are typically studied independently, it has been suggested that BDNF mediates several of the effects of estrogen in the hippocampus, and that these interactions play a role in the normal brain as well as disease. Here we focus on the mossy fiber (MF) pathway of the hippocampus, a critical pathway in normal hippocampal function, and a prime example of a location where numerous studies support an interaction between BDNF and estrogen in the rodent brain. We first review the temporal and spatially regulated expression of BDNF and estrogen in the MFs, as well as their receptors. Then we consider the results of studies that suggest that 17β-estradiol alters hippocampal function by its influence on BDNF expression in the MF pathway. We also address the hypothesis that estrogen influences the hippocampus by mechanisms related not only to the mature form of BDNF, acting at trkB receptors, but also by regulating the precursor, proBDNF, acting at p75NTR. We suggest that the interactions between BDNF and 17β-estradiol in the MFs are potentially important in the normal function of the hippocampus, and have implications for sex differences in functions that depend on the MFs and in diseases where MF plasticity has been suggested to play an important role, Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy and addiction.

AB  - While blood vessels have long been implicated in diverse pain syndromes (e.g., migraine headache, angina pectoris, vasculitis, and Raynaud’s syndrome), underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Recent evidence supports a contribution of the vascular endothelium in endothelin-1-induced hyperalgesia, and its enhancement by repeated mechanical stimulation; a phenomenon referred to as stimulus-induced enhancement of (endothelin) hyperalgesia (SIEH). SIEH is thought to be mediated by release of ATP from endothelial cells, to act on P2X3 receptors on nociceptors. In the present study we evaluated the ability of another vasoactive hyperalgesic agent, epinephrine, to induce endothelial cell-dependent hyperalgesia and SIEH. We found that epinephrine also produces hyperalgesia and SIEH. Both P2X3 receptor antagonists, A317491 and octoxynol-9, which attenuate endothelial cell function, eliminated SIEH without affecting epinephrine hyperalgesia. We further evaluated the hypothesis that members of two important classes of drugs used to treat migraine headache, whose receptors are present in endothelial cells – the triptans and β blockers – have a vascular component to their anti-hyperalgesic action. For this, we tested the effect of ICI-118,551, a β2-adrenergic receptor antagonist and sumatriptan, an agonist at 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors, on nociceptive effects of endothelin and epinephrine. ICI-118,551 inhibited endothelin SIEH, and attenuated epinephrine hyperalgesia and SIEH. Sumatriptan inhibited epinephrine SIEH and inhibited endothelin hyperalgesia and SIEH, while having no effect on epinephrine hyperalgesia or the hyperalgesia induced by a prototypical direct-acting inflammatory mediator, prostaglandin E2. These results support the suggestion that triptans and β-blockers interact with the endothelial cell component of the blood vessel to produce anti-hyperalgesia.

AB  - Recently, we hypothesized that supraspinal structures may have important functions in discriminating between noxious mechanically and heat mediated nociception through distinct functions: facilitation and inhibition. In this study, conducted in conscious rats, we explored the role of different thalamic nuclei: the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus, the central medial (CM) nucleus, the submedius (SM) nucleus, the ventralmedial (VM) nucleus and the ventral posterolateral (VPL) nucleus, in the descending control of secondary and contralateral mechanical hyperalgesia and heat hypoalgesia occurring in intramuscularly hypertonic (HT, 5.8%) saline-induced muscle nociception. We found that the MD nuclei participated in the descending facilitation of mechanical hyperalgesia, and that the VM nuclei were specifically involved in the descending inhibition of heat hypoalgesia. Neither descending facilitation nor descending inhibition was affected after electrolytic lesion of the thalamic CM, SM, and VPL nuclei. This descending facilitatory and inhibitory modulation of nociception was strengthened by glutamate, and weakened by GABA, microinjected into the thalamic MD and VM nuclei. It is suggested that (1) thalamic MD nucleus and VM nucleus form two distinct endogenous systems in the control of noxious mechanically and heat evoked responses, and (2) the strengthening of descending inhibition and the weakening of descending facilitation by means of up regulation and down regulation of appropriate receptor expression in the VM and MD nuclei may provide a new strategic policy in treating pathological pain.

AB  - Humanin (HN) has been identified as an endogenous peptide that inhibited AD-relevant neuronal cell death. HNG, a variant of HN in which the 14th amino acid serine was replaced with glycine, can reduce infarct volume and improve neurological deficits after ischemia/reperfusion injury. In this study, we aimed to examine the neuroprotective effect of HNG on traumatic brain injury (TBI) in mice and explored whether the protective effect was associated with regulating apoptosis and autophagy. Compared to vehicle-treated groups, mice administered HNG intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) prior to TBI had decreased cells with plasmalemma permeability in the injured cortex and hippocampus (48 h, P &lt; 0.01), reduced brain lesion volume (days 14 and 28, P &lt; 0.05), improved motor performance (days 1–4, P &lt; 0.05) and ameliorated performance in the Morris water maze test (days 11–13, P &lt; 0.05) post TBI. Reduced lesion volume (day 14, P &lt; 0.05) was also observed even when HNG was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 1 h and 2 h post TBI, and minor amelioration in motor and Morris water maze test deficits was also observed. Immunoblotting results showed that HNG pretreatment (i.c.v.) reversed TBI-induced cleavage of cysteinyl aspartate-specific protease-3 and poly ADPribose-polymerase and decline of Bcl-2, suppressed LC3II, Beclin-1 and vacuolar sorting protein 34 activation and maintained p62 levels in the injured cortex and hippocampus post TBI (compared with vehicle). In conclusion, HNG treatment improved morphological and functional outcomes after TBI in mice and the protective effect of HNG against TBI may be associated with down-regulating apoptosis and autophagy.

AB  - The axonal development of serotonin (5-HT)-, noradrenaline (NA)-, or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-containing monoaminergic neurons is affected by rearing conditions during the juvenile period. Impaired monoaminergic axonal development is implicated in the pathophysiology of emotional and cognitive dysfunction. On the other hand, exercise may have beneficial effects on emotional and learning performance in adults. We have examined whether voluntary running exercise during social isolation after early weaning (early weaning/social isolation; EI) from postnatal day (PD) 14–28 could prevent the impaired monoaminergic axonal development associated with EI. Compared with control animals reared with their dam and siblings until PD28, the EI animals showed lower density of 5-HT and NA axons in the dorsal–medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and basolateral nucleus of the amygdala and of NA- and TH-containing axons in the ventral-mPFC. These adverse effects of EI were not observed in rats taking part in voluntary running (EI + R) when these animals were compared to controls. The 5-HT axon density in the ventral-mPFC was significantly higher in the EI + R rats than that in the EI rats, although both these values were significantly lower than those in the control rats. The density of monoaminergic axons in the dentate gyrus and CA3 of the hippocampus was not affected by either EI or EI + R. These results suggest that the beneficial effects of voluntary running may be because of the modulation of monoaminergic axonal morphology. Our findings will hopefully provide the basis for future research into the beneficial effects of voluntary exercise during the juvenile period on brain development and emotional and cognitive performance.

KW  - amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by selective loss of motor neurons which leads to progressive paralysis and death by respiratory failure. Although the cause of sporadic ALS is still unknown, oxidative stress is suggested to play a major role in the pathogenesis of this disease and of the rare familial form, which often exhibits mutations of the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene. Since enhanced iron levels are discussed to participate in oxidative stress and neuronal death, we analyzed the expression levels of Fe-related mRNAs in a cell culture ALS model with the G93A mutation of SOD1.

We observed an increased total iron content in G93A-SOD1 SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells compared to wild-type (WT)-SOD1 cells. mRNA expression for transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and divalent metal transporter 1 was increased in G93A-SOD1 cells, which was in accordance with higher iron uptake. Experiments with the iron chelator deferoxamine revealed a normal reaction of WT and mutant cells to cytoplasmic iron depletion, i.e. TfR1 upregulation, suggesting a basically conserved function of the iron-responsive element/iron regulatory protein (IRE/IRP) pathway, designed to adapt gene expression to iron levels. Expression levels of mitoferrin 1 and 2, frataxin, and iron–sulfur cluster scaffold protein were also significantly increased in G93A-SOD1 cells, suggesting higher mitochondrial iron import and utilization in biosynthetic pathways within the mitochondria. Moreover, expression of these transcripts was further enhanced, if G93A-SOD1 cells were differentiated by retinoic acid (RA). Since RA treatment increased cytoplasmic reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in these cells, an IRE/IRP independent, ROS-mediated mechanism may account for dysregulation of iron-related genes.

AB  - Thyroid hormones (TH) are essential for normal brain development. Even modest degrees of TH disruption experienced in utero can result in neuropsychological deficits in children despite normal thyroid status at birth. Neurotrophins have been implicated in a host of brain cellular functions, and in particular, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has a well documented role in development and function of the nervous system. A number of laboratories have reported the effects of TH administration or severe deprivation on neurotrophin expression in brain. This review provides an overview and update of recent developments in the thyroid field as they relate to the nervous system. Secondly, we describe an animal model of low level TH insufficiency that is more relevant for studying the neurological consequences associated with the modest TH perturbations of subclinical hypothyroidism, or that would be anticipated from exposure to environmental contaminants with a mode-of-action that involves the thyroid. Finally, we review the available in vivo literature on TH-mediated alterations in neurotrophins, particularly BDNF, and discuss their possible contribution to brain impairments associated with TH insufficiency. The observations of altered BDNF protein and gene expression have varied as a function of hypothyroid model, age, and brain region assessed. Only a handful of studies have investigated the relationship of neurotrophins and TH using models of TH deprivation that are not severe, and dose–response information is sparse. Differences in the models used, species, doses, regions assessed, age at assessment, and method employed make it difficult to reach a consensus. Based on the available literature, the case for a direct role for BDNF in thyroid-mediated effects in the brain is not compelling. We conclude that delineation of the potential role of neurotrophins in TH-mediated neuronal development may be more fruitful by examining additional neurotrophins (e.g., nerve growth factor), moderate degrees of TH insufficiency, and younger ages. We further suggest that investigation of BDNF invoked by synaptic activation (i.e., plasticity, enrichment, trauma) may serve to elucidate a role of thyroid hormone in BDNF-regulated synaptic function.

AB  - Vesicular monoamine transporters (VMAT) are involved in presynaptic storage and release of neurotransmitters. While it was thought initially that only VMAT2 is brain expressed and VMAT1 is present only in the periphery, recent data have challenged the exclusive expression of VMAT2 in the brain. To further elucidate the role of VMAT1 brain expression and its potential role in neuropsychiatric disorders, we have investigated mice lacking VMAT1. Comparison of wildtype and knock-out (KO) mice using qPCR and immunohistochemistry documents the expression of VMAT1 in the brain. Deletion of VMAT1 leads to increased hippocampal apoptosis and reduced neurogenesis as assessed by caspase-3-labeling and 5-bromo-deoxy-uridine-labeling. Behavioral data show that mice lacking VMAT1 have neurocognitive deficits. VMAT2 expression is not altered in VMAT1 KO mice, suggesting a distinct role of VMAT1. Our data support VMAT1 brain expression and suggest that VMAT1 plays a key role in survival of hippocampal neurons and thus might contribute to neurocognitive deficits observed in neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Pretreatment with estrogen has been shown to increase subventricular zone (SVZ) neurogenesis and improve neurological outcome after cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury in mice. However, the potential of post-stroke estrogen administration to enhance neurogenesis is largely unknown. In this study, we explored whether post-stroke estradiol administration had any effect on SVZ neurogenesis in a rat model of permanent focal cerebral ischemia and elucidated the potential mechanism of its effects. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (250–280 g) were divided into sham-operated (n = 10), control (n = 40), and estradiol-treated (n = 40) groups. 5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was used to label proliferating cells. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect neurogenesis in the ischemic ipsilateral SVZ at 1, 3, 7 and 14 days following ischemia. The protein levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in ischemic ipsilateral SVZ were determined by Western blotting at 6, 12, 24 and 72 h after ischemia. Improved behavioral deficits and reduced infarct size were seen in estradiol-treated rats (P &lt; 0.05). Post-stroke estradiol administration increased BrdU-labeled cells, nestin-positive cells, doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells and BrdU+/DCX+ cells in the ischemic ipsilateral SVZ at all time points (P &lt; 0.05). Treatment with estradiol also increased HIF-1α and VEGF protein levels in the ischemic ipsilateral SVZ at all time points examined (P &lt; 0.05). These findings indicate that post-stroke estradiol administration promotes SVZ neurogenesis in rats, probably by increasing HIF-1α and VEGF protein expression.

AB  - Because dendritic spines are the sites of excitatory synapses, pathological changes in spine morphology should be considered as part of pathological changes in neuronal circuitry in the forms of synaptic connections and connectivity strength. In the past, spine pathology has usually been measured by changes in their number or shape. A more complete understanding of spine pathology requires visualization at the nanometer level to analyze how the changes in number and size affect their presynaptic partners and associated astrocytic processes, as well as organelles and other intracellular structures. Currently, serial section electron microscopy (ssEM) offers the best approach to address this issue because of its ability to image the volume of brain tissue at the nanometer resolution. Renewed interest in ssEM has led to recent technological advances in imaging techniques and improvements in computational tools indispensable for three-dimensional analyses of brain tissue volumes. Here we consider the small but growing literature that has used ssEM analysis to unravel ultrastructural changes in neuropil including dendritic spines. These findings have implications in altered synaptic connectivity and cell biological processes involved in neuropathology, and serve as anatomical substrates for understanding changes in network activity that may underlie clinical symptoms.

AB  - Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant tandem repeat expansion disorder involving cognitive, psychiatric and motor symptoms. The expanded trinucleotide (CAG) repeat leads to an extended polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein and a subsequent cascade of molecular and cellular pathogenesis. One of the key features of neuropathology, which has been shown to precede the eventual loss of neurons in the cerebral cortex, striatum and other areas, are changes to synapses, including the dendritic protrusions known as spines. In this review we will focus on synapse and spine pathology in HD, including molecular and experience-dependent aspects of pathogenesis. Dendritic spine pathology has been found in both the human HD brain at post mortem as well as various transgenic and knock-in animal models. These changes may help explain the symptoms in HD, and synaptopathy within the cerebral cortex may be particularly important in mediating the psychiatric and cognitive manifestations of this disease. The earliest stages of synaptic dysfunction in HD, as assayed in various mouse models, appears to involve changes in synaptic proteins and associated physiological abnormalities such as synaptic plasticity deficits. In mouse models, synaptic and cortical plasticity deficits have been directly correlated with the onset of cognitive deficits, implying a causal link. Furthermore, following the discovery that environmental enrichment can delay onset of affective, cognitive and motor deficits in HD transgenic mice, specific synaptic molecules shown to be dysregulated by the polyglutamine-induced toxicity were also found to be beneficially modulated by environmental stimulation. This identifies potential molecular targets for future therapeutic developments to treat this devastating disease.

AB  - Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a highly prevalent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive loss of cognition and the presence of two hallmark lesions, senile plaques (SP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), which result from the accumulation and deposition of the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) and the aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, respectively. Initially, it was thought that Aβ fibrils, which make up SP, were the root cause of the massive neurodegeneration usual found in AD brains. Over time, the longstanding emphasis on fibrillar Aβ deposits and neuronal death slowly gave way to a new paradigm involving soluble oligomeric forms of Aβ, which play a prominent role in triggering the cognitive deficits by specifically targeting synapses and disrupting synaptic signaling pathways. While this paradigm is widely accepted today in the AD field, the molecular details have not been fully elucidated. In this review, we address some of the important evidence, which has led to the Aβ oligomer-centric hypothesis as well as some of the key findings concerning the effects of Aβ oligomers on synapses at a morphological and functional level. Understanding how Aβ oligomers target synapses provides an important framework for ongoing AD research, which can lead to the development of successful therapeutic strategies designed to alter or perhaps reverse the course of the disease.

AB  - Abnormalities in dendritic spines have commonly been observed in brain specimens from epilepsy patients and animal models of epilepsy. However, the functional implications and clinical consequences of this dendritic pathology for epilepsy are uncertain. Dendritic spine abnormalities may promote hyperexcitable circuits and seizures in some types of epilepsy, especially in specific genetic syndromes with documented dendritic pathology, but in these cases it is difficult to differentiate their effects on seizures versus other comorbidities, such as cognitive deficits and autism. In other situations, seizures themselves may cause damage to dendrites and dendritic spines and this seizure-induced brain injury may then contribute to progressive epileptogenesis, memory problems and other neurological deficits in epilepsy patients. The mechanistic basis of dendritic spine abnormalities in epilepsy has begun to be elucidated and suggests novel therapeutic strategies for treating epilepsy and its complications.

In that time, changes in the number and morphology of dendritic spines have been correlated to the developmental process as well as the pathophysiology of a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the sheer scale of synaptic connectivity in the brain, work to date has merely scratched the surface in the study of normal spine function and pathology. This review will highlight traditional approaches to the imaging of dendritic spines and newer approaches made possible by advances in microscopy, protein engineering, and image analysis. The review will also describe recent work that is leading researchers toward the possibility of a systematic and comprehensive study of spine anatomy throughout the brain.

AB  - Dendritic spines are the principal recipients of excitatory synaptic inputs and the basic units of neural computation in the mammalian brain. Alterations in the density, size, shape, and turnover of mature spines, or defects in how spines are generated and establish synapses during brain development, could all result in neuronal dysfunction and lead to cognitive and/or behavioral impairments. That spines are abnormal in fragile X syndrome (FXS) and in the best-studied animal model of this disorder, the Fmr1 knockout mouse, is an undeniable fact. But the trouble with spines in FXS is that the exact nature of their defect is still controversial. Here, we argue that the most consistent abnormality of spines in FXS may be a subtle defect in activity-dependent spine plasticity and maturation. We also propose some future directions for research into spine plasticity in FXS at the cellular and ultrastructural levels that could help solve a two-decade-long riddle about the integrity of synapses in this prototypical neurodevelopmental disorder.

AB  - We tested quercetin, a dietary bioflavonoid with potent free radical scavenging action and antioxidant activity, for its neuroprotective effects in rotenone-induced hemi-parkinsonian rats. Rats were infused unilaterally with rotenone into the substantia nigra, and quercetin (25–75 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered at 12-h intervals for 4 days, and analyzed on the 5th day. Amphetamine- or apomorphine-induced unilateral rotations were significantly reduced in quercetin-treated rats, when analyzed on 14th or 16th day post-surgery, respectively. Quercetin possessed potent hydroxyl radical scavenging action in a cells-free, Fenton-like reaction in test tubes, and in isolated mitochondria when measured by salicylate hydroxylation method. We observed dose-dependent attenuation of the rotenone-induced loss in striatal dopamine, and nigral oxidized and reduced glutathione, as well as the increases in endogenous antioxidant enzymes (catalase and superoxide dismutase) activities supporting the notion that quercetin-effect is mediated via its powerful hydroxyl radicals-scavenging and antioxidant actions. Quercetin’s dose-dependent ability to up-regulate mitochondrial complex-I activity, as evidenced by NADH-oxidation, and as seen in blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) staining in both the contra- and ipsi-lateral nigra suggests the containment of reactive oxygen production at the mitochondrial level. Rotenone-induced induction of NADH-diaphorase activity in the nigral neurons, and its attenuation by quercetin pointed to the possible involvement of nitric oxide too. Reversal of neuronal death induced by rotenone as observed by increased tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells and decreased TdT-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining in the substantia nigra confirmed the potential of quercetin to revamp dopaminergic cells following oxidative stress mediated programmed cell death and neuronal demise. The present study strongly implicates quercetin’s potential ability to repair mitochondrial electron transport defects and to up-regulate its function as the basis of neuroprotection observed in a mitochondrial neurotoxin-induced Parkinsonism.

AB  - Exposure to severe stress leads to development of neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in at-risk individuals. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is associated with resilience or improved recovery. Therefore exogenous administration to the brain has therapeutic potential although peripheral administration can trigger undesirable side effects. Here, we established conditions with intranasal (IN) NPY infusion to rats to obtain CSF concentrations in the proposed anxiolytic range without significant change in plasma NPY. Rats were pretreated with IN NPY or vehicle before exposure to single prolonged stress (SPS) animal model of PTSD and compared to untreated controls. The IN NPY appeared to lessen the perceived severity of stress, as these animals displayed less time immobile in forced swim part of the SPS. Thirty minutes after SPS the elevation of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone was not as pronounced in NPY-infused rats and the induction of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in locus coeruleus (LC) was attenuated. Seven days after SPS, they displayed lower depressive-like behavior on Forced Swim Test and reduced anxiety-like behavior on Elevated Plus Maze. The prolonged effect of SPS on Acoustic Startle Response was also lower in NPY-infused rats. Plasma ACTH, corticosterone, and hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor levels were significantly above controls only in the vehicle – but not IN NPY-treated group 1 week after SPS. Baseline TH mRNA levels in LC did not differ among groups, but increased with forced swim in the vehicle – but not NPY-pretreated animals. Administration of IN NPY after exposure to SPS led to similar, but not identical, reduction in development of anxiety, depressive-like behavior and hyperarousal. The results show that single IN NPY can alter stress-triggered dysregulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and activation of central noradrenergic activity. These findings provide proof of concept for potential of IN NPY for non-invasive prophylactic treatment or early intervention in response to traumatic stress.

AB  - Dramatic changes in the cytoskeleton and the morphology of oligodendrocytes (OLs) occur during various stages of the myelination process. OLs in culture produce large membrane sheets containing cytoskeletal veins of microtubules and actin filaments. We recently showed that estrogen receptors (ER) related to ERα/β were expressed in the membrane sheets of mature OLs in culture. Ligation of these or other membrane ERs in OLs with both 17β- and 17α-estradiol mediated rapid non-genomic signaling. Here, we show that estrogens also mediate rapid non-genomic remodeling of the cytoskeleton in mature OLs in culture. 17β-Estradiol caused a rapid loss of microtubules and the actin cytoskeleton in the OL membrane sheets. It also increased phosphorylation of the actin filament-severing protein cofilin, thus inactivating it. Staining for actin barbed ends with rhodamine-actin showed that it decreased the amount of actin barbed ends. 17α-Estradiol, on the other hand, increased the percentage of cells with abundant staining of actin filaments and actin barbed ends, suggesting that it stabilized and/or increased the dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. The specific ERα and ERβ agonists, 4,4′,4″-(4-propyl-(1H)-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl) trisphenol (PPT) and diarylpropionitrile 2,3-bis(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-propionitrile (DPN), respectively, also caused the rapid phosphorylation of cofilin. Estrogen-induced phosphorylation of cofilin was inhibited by Y-27632, a specific inhibitor of the Rho-associated protein serine/threonine kinase (ROCK). The Rho/ROCK/cofilin pathway is therefore implicated in actin rearrangement via estrogen ligation of membrane ERs, which may include forms of ERα and ERβ. These results indicate a role for estrogens in modulation of the cytoskeleton in mature OLs, and thus in various processes required for myelinogenesis.

AB  - In heroin-dependent individuals, the drive to avoid or ameliorate the negative affective/emotional state associated with the discontinuation of heroin contributes to the chronic relapsing nature of the disease. Here, we investigate changes in proopiomelanocortin (POMC) expression at three time points across an extended period of heroin withdrawal in a clinically relevant rodent model of addiction using conditioned place aversion (CPA) in POMC-EGFP (POMC-enhanced green fluorescent protein) bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice. Neurons expressing POMC-EGFP were found in the medial nucleus of the amygdala (MeA), basomedial amygdala (BMA) and dentate gyrus of hippocampus (DG), as well as the arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus (ARC). Heroin-treated mice displayed robust CPA after acute spontaneous withdrawal (12 h), which persisted across the extended (14 days) withdrawal period. After 12-h withdrawal, heroin-treated mice showed lower signal intensity of POMC-EGFP-positive cells in the ARC, higher levels of POMC mRNA in the amygdala but lower levels in the hippocampus than saline controls. After 7-d withdrawal, heroin-treated mice showed fewer POMC-EGFP-positive cells in the MeA and lower POMC mRNA in the amygdala than saline controls. After extended (14 days) withdrawal, heroin-treated mice showed more POMC-EGFP-positive cells in BMA and DG, increased intensity of POMC-EGFP signal in DG, and higher POMC mRNA levels in the hippocampus compared to controls. Our results show dynamic changes in POMC in hypothalamic and extra-hypothalamic regions that may contribute to the negative affective/emotional state of heroin withdrawal shown by CPA from acute to extended periods of heroin withdrawal.

AB  - Rats were subjected to 90 min of focal ischemia by occluding the left middle cerebral and both common carotid arteries. The dynamic changes in the formation of brain ischemic areas were analyzed by measuring the direct current (DC) potential and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) fluorescence with ultraviolet irradiation. In the lidocaine group (n = 10), 30 min before ischemia, an intravenous bolus (1.5 mg/kg) of lidocaine was administered, followed by a continuous infusion (2 mg/kg/h) for 150 min. In the control group (n = 10), an equivalent amount of saline was administered. Following the initiation of ischemia, an area of high-intensity NADH fluorescence rapidly developed in the middle cerebral artery territory in both groups and the DC potential in this area showed ischemic depolarization. An increase in NADH fluorescence closely correlated with the DC depolarization. The blood flow in the marginal zone of both groups showed a similar decrease. Five minutes after the onset of ischemia, the area of high-intensity NADH fluorescence was significantly smaller in the lidocaine group (67% of the control; P = 0.01). This was likely due to the suppression of ischemic depolarization by blockage of voltage-dependent sodium channels with lidocaine. Although lidocaine administration did not attenuate the number of peri-infarct depolarizations during ischemia, the high-intensity area and infarct volume were significantly smaller in the lidocaine group both at the end of ischemia (78% of the control; P = 0.046) and 24 h later (P = 0.02). A logistic regression analysis demonstrated a relationship between the duration of ischemic depolarization and histologic damage and revealed that lidocaine administration did not attenuate neuronal damage when the duration of depolarization was identical. These findings indicate that the mechanism by which lidocaine decreases infarct volume is primarily through a reduction of the brain area undergoing NADH fluorescence increases which closely correlates with depolarization.

AB  - Expansion of medical marijuana use in the US and the recently successful decriminalization of recreational marijuana in two States elevates interest in the specific cognitive effects of Δ9tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9THC), the major psychoactive constituent of marijuana. Controlled laboratory studies in nonhuman primates provide mixed evidence for specific effects of Δ9THC in learning and memory tasks, with a suggestion that frontal-mediated tasks may be the most sensitive. In this study, adult male rhesus monkeys were trained on tasks which assess reversal learning, extradimensional attentional shift learning and spatial delayed-response. Subjects were challenged with 0.1–0.5 mg/kg Δ9THC, i.m., in randomized order and evaluated on the behavioral measures. Peak plasma levels of Δ9THC were observed 30 min after 0.2 mg/kg (69 ± 29 ng/ml) and 60 min after 0.5 mg/kg (121 ± 23 ng/ml) was administered and behavioral effects on a bimanual motor task persisted for up to 2 h after injection. An increase in errors-to-criterion (ETC) associated with reversal learning was further increased by Δ9THC in a dose-dependent manner. The increase in ETC associated with extradimensional shifts was not affected by Δ9THC. Spatial delayed-response performance was impaired by Δ9THC in a retention-interval-dependent manner. Overall the pattern of results suggests a more profound effect of Δ9THC on tasks mediated by orbitofrontal (reversal learning) versus dorsolateral (extradimensional shifts) prefrontal mechanisms.

AB  - Voxel based morphometry (VBM) is a widely used technique for studying the structure of the brain. Direct comparisons between the results obtained using VBM and the underlying histology are limited, however. To circumvent the problems inherent in comparing VBM data in vivo with tissue samples that must generally be obtained post-mortem, we chose to consider GABAA receptors, measured using 18F-flumazenil PET (18F-FMZ-PET), as non-invasive neural markers to be compared with VBM data. Consistent with previous cortical thickness findings, GABAA receptor binding potential (BPND) was found to correlate positively across regions with grey matter (GM) density. These findings confirm that there is a general positive relationship between MRI-based GM density measures and GABAA receptor BPND on a region-by-region basis (i.e., regions with more GM tend to also have higher BPND).

AB  - The human insula has been the focus of great attention in the last decade due to substantial progress in neuroimaging methodology and applications. Anatomical support for functional localization and interpretations, however, is still fragmented. The aim of the present study was to re-examine the microanatomical organization of the insula and relate cytoarchitectonic maps to major sulcal/gyral patterns by registration to high-resolution MR images of the same brains. The insula was divided into seven architectonic subdivisions (G, Ig, Id1–3, Ia1–2) that were charted on unfolded maps of the insula following a method used previously in monkeys. The results reveal overall similar patterns of Nissl, and to some extent also, myelin and parvalbumin (PV), as in monkeys, with a postero-dorsal to antero-ventral gradient of hypergranular to granular, dysgranular and agranular fields. Reversals occur ventrally along the inferior peri-insular sulcus (IPS), at the margin with the temporal operculum, and anteriorly at the limit with orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). A large portion of agranular cortex is characterized by a dense accumulation of the spindle-shaped von Economo neurons (VENs) in layer V. The distribution of VENs is not restricted to agranular insula but also extends into the anterior part of dysgranular fields. The patterns of intracortical myelin and of PV neuropil in the middle layers follow decreasing gradients from postero-dorsal granular to antero-ventral agranular insula, with particularly strong staining in posterior and dorsal insula. A separate PV enhanced area in the middle-dorsal insula corresponds in location to the presumed human gustatory area. Projections of the cytoarchitectonic maps onto high-resolution stereotactic MRI reveal a near concentric organization around the limen insula, with each cytoarchitectonic subdivision encompassing several major insular gyri/sulci. The dysgranular domain is the largest, taking up about half of the insula. The present study of the human insula provides a new anatomical basis for MR imaging and clinical applications.

AB  - Accumulating experimental evidence suggests that groups of neurons in the CNS might react to pathological insults by activating developmental-like programs for survival, regeneration and re-establishment of lost connections. For instance, in cell and animal models it was shown that after trauma mature central neurons become dependent on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) trophic support for survival. This event is preceded by a shift of postsynaptic GABAA receptor-mediated responses from hyperpolarization to developmental-like depolarization. These profound functional changes in GABAA receptor-mediated transmission and the requirement of injured neurons for BDNF trophic support are interdependent.

Thyroid hormones (THs) play a crucial role in the development of the nervous system, having significant effects on dendritic branching, synaptogenesis and axonal growth to name a few. In the adult nervous system TH thyroxin has been shown to have a neuroprotective effect and to promote regeneration in experimental trauma models. Interestingly, after trauma there is a qualitative change in the regulatory effect of thyroxin on BDNF expression as well as on GABAergic transmission. In this review we provide an overview of the post-traumatic changes in these signaling systems and discuss the potential significance of their interactions for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

AB  - The notion that stress plays a role in the etiology of psychotic disorders, especially schizophrenia, is longstanding. However, it is only in recent years that the potential neural mechanisms mediating this effect have come into sharper focus. The introduction of more sophisticated models of the interplay between psychosocial factors and brain function has expanded our opportunities for conceptualizing more detailed psychobiological models of stress in psychosis. Further, scientific advances in our understanding of adolescent brain development have shed light on a pivotal question that has challenged researchers; namely, why the first episode of psychosis typically occurs in late adolescence/young adulthood.

In this paper, we begin by reviewing the evidence supporting associations between psychosocial stress and psychosis in diagnosed patients as well as individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis. We then discuss biological stress systems and examine changes that precede and follow psychosis onset. Next, research findings on structural and functional brain characteristics associated with psychosis are presented; these findings suggest that normal adolescent neuromaturational processes may go awry, thereby setting the stage for the emergence of psychotic syndromes. Finally, a model of neural mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of psychosis is presented and directions for future research strategies are explored.

AB  - Post-stroke dementia (PSD) is a common clinical disease and the central cholinergic circuits are important to cognitive function. Icariin (ICA), a flavonoid isolated from Herba Epimedii, was reported to improve cognitive function through modulating the cholinergic system. But there were no studies exploring the role of ICA in PSD animal models. In this study, we used transient middle cerebral artery occlusion mice with cognitive dysfunction in the PSD model. PSD mice were then randomly divided into six groups: Sham-operated + placebo group, Sham-operated + ICA group (60 mg/kg), PSD model + placebo group, PSD model + ICA group (30, 60, or 120 mg/kg). We observed spatial learning ability and memory by Morris water maze test. The levels of acetylcholine (ACH) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the degree of histone acetylation and the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation in the central cholinergic circuits were investigated by Western blot and immunofluorescence. After the administration of various doses of ICA, the escape latency and searching distance of the PSD mice were reduced significantly compared with those without ICA treatment. While the levels of ACH and ChAT declined, the degree of histone acetylation and the CREB phosphorylation was improved in a dose-dependent manner in central cholinergic circuits. In conclusion, ICA can improve post-stroke dementia, and the mechanism is likely to enhance CREB phosphorylation in the central cholinergic circuits, thus improving the damage in cholinergic circuits histone acetylation homeostasis.

AB  - Adolescence is the transition from childhood to adulthood, with onset marked by puberty and the offset by relative independence from parents. Across species, it is a time of incredible change that carries increased risks and rewards. The ability of the individual to respond adequately to the mental, physical and emotional stresses of life during this time is a function of both their early environment and their present state. In this article, we focus on the effects that acute threat and chronic stress have on the brain and behavior in humans and rodents. First, we highlight developmental changes in frontolimbic function as healthy individuals transition into and out of adolescence. Second, we examine genetic factors that may enhance susceptibility to stress in one individual over another using translation from genetic mouse models to human neuroimaging. Third, we examine how the timing and nature of stress varies in its impact on brain and behavior. These findings are discussed in the context of implications for adolescent mental health and illness.

AB  - This study examined the projections from the rat insular cortex (Ins) to lower brainstem areas which are possibly involved in orofacial pain processing. We first examined distributions of Ins neurons projecting directly to the trigeminal caudal subnucleus (Vc, medullary dorsal horn) and oral subnucleus (Vo) which are known to receive orofacial nociceptive inputs. After injections of a retrograde tracer, Fluorogold (FG), into the medial part and lateral part of laminae I/II of Vc, many neurons were labeled bilaterally with a contralateral predominance in the rostral level of granular Ins (GI) and dysgranular Ins (DI) and the caudal level of GI/DI, respectively, but none in the agranular Ins (AI). After FG injections into laminae III–V of Vc, no Ins neurons were labeled. After FG injections into the Vo, many neurons were labeled bilaterally with a contralateral predominance in the rostral and caudal GI/DI, but none in the AI. We then examined descending projections from the GI/DI to the lower brainstem. After injections of an anterograde tracer, biotinylated dextranamine (BDA), into the rostral GI/DI, many BDA-labeled axons and terminals were seen bilaterally with a contralateral predominance in the medial part of laminae I/II of Vc, dorsomedial Vo, juxtatrigeminal region, rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), and nucleus of the solitary tract, and with an ipsilateral predominance in the parabrachial nucleus (Pb), Kölliker–Fuse nucleus (KF) and trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus. After BDA injections into the caudal GI/DI, they were seen bilaterally with a contralateral predominance in the lateral part of laminae I/II of Vc, ventrolateral Vo, juxtatrigeminal region and RVM, and with an ipsilateral dominance in the lateral zone (PAGl) of periaqueductal gray, Pb and KF. These results suggest that orofacial nociceptive processing of Vc and Vo neurons may be regulated by GI/DI directly or indirectly through brainstem nuclei such as PAGl, Pb, KF and RVM.

AB  - The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is involved in higher cognitive and memory functions, and is associated with the etiology of neurological diseases involving cognitive decline, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We hypothesized that spine changes in the α7 knockout might help to explain the behavioral deficits observed in α7 knockout mice and prodromal hippocampal changes in AD. We quantified several measures of dendritic morphology in the CA1 region of the mouse hippocampus in Golgi-stained material from wildtype and α7 knockout mice at P24. The most significant difference was a 64% increase in thin (L-type) dendritic spines on the CA1 basilar tree in knockout mice (p &lt; .05). There were small decreases in the number of in N-type (−15%), M-type (−14%) and D-type (−4%) spine densities. The CA1 basilar dendritic tree of knockout mice had significantly less branching in the regions near the soma in comparison with wildtype animals (p &lt; .01), but not in the more distal branching. Changes in the configuration of CA1 basilar dendritic spines have been observed in a number of experimental paradigms, suggesting that basilar dendritic spines are highly plastic. One component of cognitive dysfunction may be through α7-modulated GABAergic interneurons synapsing on CA1 basal dendrites.

AB  - Microglial phagocytosis plays a key role in neuroprotective and neurodegenerative responses of the innate immune system in the brain. Here we investigated the regulatory function of phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ) in phagocytosis of bacteria and Zymosan particles by mouse brain microglia in vitro and in vivo. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches our data revealed PI3Kγ as an essential mediator of microglial phagocytosis. Unexpectedly, microglia expressing lipid kinase deficient mutant PI3Kγ exhibited similar phagocytosis as wild-type cells. These data suggest kinase-independent stimulation of cAMP phosphodiesterase activity by PI3Kγ as a crucial mediator of phagocytosis. In sum our findings indicate PI3Kγ-dependent suppression of cAMP signaling as a critical regulatory element of microglial phagocytosis.

AB  - The ability to reweight visual and proprioceptive information is critical for maintaining postural stability in a dynamic environment. In this study, we examined whether visual anticipation of collision avoidance (AV) while standing could facilitate the down-weighting of altered proprioception in young and elderly adults. Twelve young (24.91 ± 6.44 years) and 12 elderly (74.8 ± 6.42 years) participants stood upright for 180 s under two task conditions: (a) quiet stance (QS) and (b) standing while anticipating virtual objects to be avoided. In order to disrupt the accuracy of proprioceptive input participants were exposed to bilateral Achilles tendon vibration during the middle 60 s of standing in both tasks. Visual field dependence was assessed using the Rod and Frame Test (RFT). Elderly demonstrated significantly higher visual field dependence compared to the young participants. Analysis of the normalized Root Mean Square (RMS) of the Center of Pressure velocity (dCoP) revealed that young participants immediately reduced the sway velocity variability induced by tendon vibration during the anticipation of collision AV compared to the QS task. In the elderly, however, the modulating influence of visual anticipation was delayed and became significant only in the last two time intervals of the vibration phase. These results suggest that volitionally shifting reliance on vision when anticipating a collision AV event facilitates the down-weighting of altered proprioception. Elderly adults seem to be unable to dynamically exploit visual anticipation in order to down weight the altered proprioception possibly as a result of their more permanent up-weighting of the visual modality. Sensory reweighting seems to be a more time consuming process in aging which may have important clinical implications for falling.

AB  - The cholinergic system plays important roles in neurotransmission in both the peripheral and central nervous systems. The cholinergic neurotransmitter acetylcholine is synthesized by choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and its action terminated by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). The predominance of AChE has focused much attention on understanding the relationship of this enzyme to ChAT-positive cholinergic neurons. However, there is ample evidence that BuChE also plays an important role in cholinergic regulation. To elucidate the relationship of BuChE to neural elements that are producing acetylcholine, the distribution of this enzyme was compared to that of ChAT in the mouse CNS. Brain tissues from 129S1/SvImJ mice were stained for BuChE and ChAT using histochemical, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent techniques. Both BuChE and ChAT were found in neural elements throughout the CNS. BuChE staining with histochemistry and immunohistochemistry produced the same distribution of labeling throughout the brain and spinal cord. Immunofluorescent double labeling demonstrated that many nuclei in the medulla oblongata, as well as regions of the spinal cord, had neurons that contained both BuChE and ChAT. BuChE-positive neurons without ChAT were found in close proximity with ChAT-positive neuropil in areas such as the thalamus and amygdala. BuChE-positive neuropil was also found closely associated with ChAT-positive neurons, particularly in tegmental nuclei of the pons. These observations provide further neuroanatomical evidence of a role for BuChE in the regulation of acetylcholine levels in the CNS.

AB  - The present study examined whether status epilepticus (SE) induced by LiCl-pilocarpine in immature rats (postnatal day [P]12) interferes with normal development; leads to progressive epileptogenesis, or cognitive decline and to pathology similar to that seen in human temporal lobe epilepsy. We correlated the extent of pathologic changes with the severity of functional alterations or epilepsy. SE-induced changes were compared with those of rats with SE induced at P25. Animals of both ages were exposed to a battery of behavioral tests for up to 3 months after SE. Rats with SE at P12 showed mild retardation of psychomotor development and delayed habituation, whereas rats with SE at P25 showed no habituation. Assessment in adulthood using the Morris water maze test revealed that SE at both P12 and P25 led to cognitive impairment and that the severity of the impairment increased with age. A handling test revealed increased aggression in rats with SE at P25, but not in rats with SE at P12. Epilepsy was diagnosed with continuous video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring for up to 7 d. P25 rats were monitored at 5 months after SE and seizures were detected in 83.3% of animals. P12 animals were divided into two groups and monitored at 5 or 7 months after SE. Both the severity and incidence of spontaneous recurrent seizures tended to progress with time, and their incidence increased from 50% to 87.5% at 5 and 7 months, respectively. Morphometric analysis and stereologic assessment of hilar neurons performed after video-EEG monitoring revealed atrophy of temporal brain structures, enlargement of lateral ventricles, and loss of hilar neurons in both age groups. In P12 rats, morphologic damage also tended to progress over time. Performance of animals in the Morris water maze correlated with the severity of damage, but not with seizure parameters.

AB  - Neurosteroids are a class of endogenous steroids synthesized in the brain that are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders and memory impairment. Ammonia impairs long-term potentiation (LTP), a synaptic model of learning, in the hippocampus, a brain region involved in memory acquisition. Although mechanisms underlying ammonia-mediated LTP inhibition are not fully understood, we previously found that the activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) is important. Based on this, we hypothesize that metabolic stressors, including hyperammonemia, promote untimely NMDAR activation and result in neural adaptations that include the synthesis of allopregnanolone (alloP) and other GABA-potentiating neurosteroids that dampen neuronal activity and impair LTP and memory formation. Using an antibody against 5α-reduced neurosteroids, we found that 100 μM ammonia acutely enhanced neurosteroid immunostaining in pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices. The enhanced staining was blocked by finasteride, a selective inhibitor of 5α-reductase, a key enzyme required for alloP synthesis. Finasteride also overcame LTP inhibition by 100 μM ammonia, as did picrotoxin, an inhibitor of GABA-A receptors. These results indicate that GABA-enhancing neurosteroids, synthesized locally within pyramidal neurons, contribute significantly to ammonia-mediated synaptic dysfunction. These results suggest that the manipulation of neurosteroid synthesis could provide a strategy to improve cognitive function in individuals with hyperammonemia.

AB  - In the ascending auditory pathway, the inferior colliculus (IC) receives and integrates excitatory and inhibitory inputs from a variety of lower auditory nuclei, intrinsic projections within the IC, contralateral IC through the commissure of the IC and the auditory cortex. All these connections make the IC a major center for subcortical temporal and spectral integration of auditory information. In this study, we examine bilateral collicular interaction in the modulation of frequency-domain signal processing of mice using electrophysiological recording and focal electrical stimulation. Focal electrical stimulation of neurons in one IC produces widespread inhibition and focused facilitation of responses of neurons in the other IC. This bilateral collicular interaction decreases the response magnitude and lengthens the response latency of inhibited IC neurons but produces an opposite effect on the response of facilitated IC neurons. In the frequency domain, the focal electrical stimulation of one IC sharpens or expands the frequency tuning curves (FTCs) of neurons in the other IC to improve frequency sensitivity and the frequency response range. The focal electrical stimulation also produces a shift in the best frequency (BF) of modulated IC (ICMdu) neurons toward that of electrically stimulated IC (ICES) neurons. The degree of bilateral collicular interaction is dependent upon the difference in the BF between the ICES neurons and ICMdu neurons. These data suggest that bilateral collicular interaction is a part of dynamic acoustic signal processing that adjusts and improves signal processing as well as reorganizes collicular representation of signal parameters according to the acoustic experience.

AB  - The hippocampus plays a central role in stress-related mood disorders. The effects of acute vs. chronic stress on the integrity of hippocampal circuitry in influencing the vulnerability to, or resiliency against, neuronal injury are poorly understood. Here we investigated whether acute vs. chronic psychosocial isolation stress or a combination of the two (chronic stress followed by acute stress) influences the expression of the interneuronal marker parvalbumin (PV) and the chaperone-inducible heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70i) in different subregions of the hippocampus. Low levels of the Ca2+-binding protein (PV) may increase the vulnerability to neuronal injury, and Hsp70i represents an indicator of intense excitation-induced neuronal stress. Adult male Wistar rats were exposed to 2 h of immobilization (IM) or cold (4 °C) (acute stressors), 21 d of social isolation (chronic stress), or a combination of both acute and chronic stress. Both chronic isolation and the combined stressors strongly decreased the PV-immunoreactive cells in the CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) region of the hippocampus, while acute stress did not affect PV expression. The combination of acute and chronic stress induced a dramatic increase in Hsp70i expression in the DG, but Hsp70i expression was unaffected in acute and chronic stress alone. We also monitored serum corticosterone (CORT) levels as a neuroendocrine marker of the stress response. Acute stress increased CORT levels, while chronic isolation stress compromised hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenocortical (HPA) axis activity such that the normal stress response was impaired following subsequent acute stress. These results indicate that in contrast to acute stress, chronic isolation compromises the HPA axis and generates a considerable reduction in PV expression, representing a decrease in the calcium-buffering capacity and a putatively higher vulnerability of specific hippocampal interneurons to excitotoxic injury. The induction of Hsp70i expression in response to acute and chronic isolation reveals that neurons in the DG are particularly vulnerable to an acute stressor following a chronic perturbation of HPA activity.

AB  - Although significant progress has been made over the last decades, the chemical senses remain less well explored than vision or audition. One method to assess participants’ ability to identify or localize odors consists in the application of dichotomous stimuli (e.g., left- and right-sided stimulation). In this study we aimed to explore localization and identification mechanisms by investigating whether response times and response accuracy were correlated, with the aim of establishing the pertinence of response times as an additional measure for assessment of the olfactory function (1). We further examined an advantage of the right nostril which has been reported in several publications (2). We delivered two mixed olfactory/trigeminal odors (benzaldehyde and eucalyptol) to one nostril at a time in a pseudorandomized order to 23 normosmic participants; the other nostril received an odor-free air puff. In half of the trials we asked the participants to detect the stimulated nostril; in the other half, they indicated which odor they had received. We recorded response accuracy and response times.

Participants reached higher accuracy in odor identification than in localization, driven by benzaldehyde. For the stimulus eucalyptol exclusively, we observed that participants were faster to respond after stimulation of the right nostril than to the left nostril, in the localization task. Finally, response times were correlated with response accuracy in the identification task, but not in localization.

Our findings suggest that odor identification is easier than odor localization. In addition, we find further support for an advantage of the right nostril over the left nostril. Moreover, the measurement of reaction times may supplement other techniques of the assessment of odor identification.

AB  - Glutamate-induced excitotoxicity is thought to play an important role in several neurodegenerative diseases in the central nervous system (CNS). In this study, neuroprotection against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity was analyzed using acetylcholine (ACh), nicotine and the α7 specific nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR) agonist, N-[(3R)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl]-4-chlorobenzamide hydrochloride (PNU-282987), in cultured adult rat retinal neurons. Adult Long Evans rat retinas were dissociated and retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) were isolated from all other retinal tissue using a two-step panning technique. Once isolated, RGCs were cultured under various pharmacological conditions to demonstrate excitotoxicity and neuroprotection against excitotoxicity. After 3 days, RGCs were immunostained with antibodies against the glycoprotein, Thy 1.1, counted and cell survival was assessed relative to control untreated conditions. 500 μM glutamate induced excitotoxicity in large and small RGCs in an adult rat dissociated culture. After 3 days in culture with glutamate, the cell survival of large RGCs decreased by an average of 48.16% while the cell survival of small RGCs decreased by an average of 42.03%. Using specific glutamate receptor agonists and antagonists, we provide evidence that the excitotoxic response was mediated through α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)/kainic acid (KA) and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors through an apoptotic mechanism. However, the excitotoxic effect of glutamate on all RGCs was eliminated if cells were cultured for an hour with 10 μM ACh, 100 μM nicotine or 100 nM of the α7 nAChR agonist, PNU-282987, before the glutamate insult. Inhibition studies using 10 nM methyllycaconitine (MLA) or α-bungarotoxin (α-Bgt) supported the hypothesis that neuroprotection against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity on rat RGCs was mediated through α7 nAChRs. In immunocytochemical studies, double-labeled experiments using antibodies against Thy 1.1 and α7 nAChR subunits demonstrated that both large and small RGCs contained α7 nAChR subunits. The data presented in this study support the hypothesis that ACh and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists provide neuroprotection against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in adult rat RGCs through activation of α7 nAChR subunits. These studies lay the groundwork required for analyzing the effect of specific α7 nAChR agonists using in vivo models of excitotoxicity. Understanding the type of ACh receptors involved in neuroprotection in the rat retina could ultimately lead to therapeutic treatment for any CNS disease that involves excitotoxicity.

AB  - Acetylcholine plays a crucial role in the regulation of neural functions, including dopamine release, synaptic activity, and intrinsic electrophysiological properties of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell. Although the effects of acetylcholine on the action potential properties of NAc medium spiny (MS) neurons have been reported, how intrinsic acetylcholine released from NAc cholinergic interneurons regulates the neural activity of MS neurons is still an open issue. To explore the cholinergic effects on the subthreshold responses and action potential properties of MS neurons in the NAc shell, we first tested the effects of carbachol, a non-selective cholinergic agonist, on MS neuronal activity. Then, we tested the effects of the activation of cholinergic interneurons on the electrophysiological properties of MS neurons via multiple whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Bath application of carbachol induced resting membrane potential depolarization accompanied by an increase in the voltage response to negative current injection. These increases were blocked by the pre-application of pirenzepine, an M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist. In spite of the facilitative effect on voltage responses of negative current injection, carbachol diminished the characteristic slowly-depolarizing ramp potentials, which respond to positive current pulse injection. Thus, carbachol increased the rheobase and shifted the frequency–current curve toward the right. Repetitive spike firing of a cholinergic interneuron following positive current injection induced a similar increase in the rheobase, which delayed the action potential initiation in 38.9% MS neurons. In contrast to the bath application of carbachol, cholinergic interneuronal stimulation had little effect on the resting membrane potential in MS neurons. These results suggest that the acetylcholine released from a cholinergic interneuron is sufficient to suppress the repetitive spike firing of the adjacent MS neurons, although the depolarization of the resting membrane potential may require simultaneous activation of multiple cholinergic interneurons.

AB  - Obesity has been associated with multiple chronic pain disorders, including migraine. We hypothesized that diet-induced obesity would be associated with a reduced threshold for thermal nociception in the trigeminal system. In this study, we sought to examine the effect of diet-induced obesity on facial pain behavior. Mice of two different strains were fed high-fat or regular diet (RD) and tested using a well-established operant facial pain assay. We found that the effects of diet on behavior in this assay were strain and reward dependent. Obesity-prone C57BL/6J mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) display lower number of licks of a caloric, palatable reward (33% sweetened condensed milk or 30% sucrose) than control mice. This occurred at all temperatures, in both sexes, and was evident even before the onset of obesity. This diminished reward-seeking behavior was not observed in obesity-resistant SKH1-E (SK) mice. These findings suggest that diet and strain interact to modulate reward-seeking behavior. Furthermore, we observed a difference between diet groups in operant behavior with caloric, palatable rewards, but not with a non-caloric neutral reward (water). Importantly, we found no effect of diet-induced obesity on acute thermal nociception in the absence of inflammation or injury. This indicates that thermal sensation in the face is not affected by obesity-associated peripheral neuropathy as it occurs when studying pain behaviors in the rodent hindpaw. Future studies using this model may reveal whether obesity facilitates the development of chronic pain after injury or inflammation.

AB  - The soluble form of CD146 has been reported to be present in various inflammatory diseases and displays pro-inflammatory properties. However, little is known about sCD146 in multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we show that sCD146 is significantly elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with active MS compared with that of inactive MS or patients with non-demyelinating diseases. Moreover, abnormally increased sCD146 in the CSF of active MS patients correlated with albumin quotient, MBP antibody and MOG antibody from both CSF and sera. Importantly, the level of CSF sCD146 is correlated with levels of inflammatory factors, such as TNFα, IFNγ, IL-2, and IL-17A in the CSF. We also found that CSF sCD146 might originate from membrane-bound CD146 on inflamed blood–brain barrier (BBB) endothelial cells. In addition, sCD146 promotes leukocyte transmigration in vitro, at least in part by stimulating the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on endothelial cells. Our findings suggest that CSF levels of sCD146 may provide a potential marker for monitoring disease activity in MS patients.

AB  - The kinematics of hand transport and grasp formation when reaching for and grasping cubes of different sizes were investigated in subjects with blepharospasm, subjects with torticollis and healthy subjects. Patients scaled peak grasp aperture accurately to object size, reflecting accurate sensorimotor integration of the intrinsic object characteristics. Likewise, the timing of peak grasp aperture in relation to the time of hand transport did not differ between patients and controls. In contrast, patients with blepharospasm and torticollis produced longer movement times and smaller peak velocities of hand transport. Increased movement times and slowed hand transport correlated significantly with symptom severity as assessed by the Unified Dystonia Rating Scale. The observation that the processing of peak grasp aperture was unaffected by blepharospasm or torticollis does not support the current concept of impaired sensorimotor integration. The slowing of hand transport appears to reflect a strategic response to compensate for insecurities in the execution of reaching movements to be found in focal dystonia of the face and neck.

AB  - Neonatal cerebral hypoxia–ischemia (HI) is an important cause of neurological disorders. In the preterm children, HI causes preferentially white matter damage and late cognitive impairments. Rodent HI performed at postnatal day 3 (HIP3) provides valuable information on the brain response to injury in immature animals as related to sensory, motor and cognitive impairments observed in humans born prematurely. The present study aimed to observe the effects of brain lateralization and sexual dimorphism following HIP3 on behavior and histological damage assessed in adulthood. Male and female Wistar rats had their right or left common carotid artery occluded and exposed to 8% oxygen for 1.5 h; control rats received sham surgery and exposure to 1.5 h of room air in isolation of their dams. Sensory and cognitive parameters were assessed by the use of elevated plus maze, cylinder test and Morris water maze. After behavioral testing, hemisphere and hippocampus volumes were used to define brain damage extension; white matter damage was estimated through corpus callosum area ratio. No motor impairments were shown in HIP3 rats and anxiety-related changes were observed only in right injured animals. Females having left occlusion were more vulnerable to HIP3 injury since they presented spatial memory impairment and greater histological damage. These results show the modulation exerted by sex and brain lateralization following early HI at postnatal day 3.

AB  - Recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) has been successfully tested as neuroprotectant in brain injury models. The first large clinical trial with stroke patients, however, revealed negative results. Reasons are manifold and may include side-effects such as thrombotic complications or interactions with other medication, EPO concentration, penetration of the blood–brain-barrier and/or route of application. The latter is restricted to systemic application. Here we hypothesize that EPO is neuroprotective in a rat model of acute subdural hemorrhage (ASDH) and that direct cortical application is a feasible route of application in this injury type. The subdural hematoma was surgically evacuated and EPO was applied directly onto the surface of the brain.

We injected NaCl, 200, 2000 or 20,000 IU EPO per rat i.v. at 15 min post-ASDH (400 μl autologous venous blood) or NaCl, 0.02, 0.2 or 2 IU per rat onto the cortical surface after removal of the subdurally infused blood t at 70 min post-ASDH. Arterial blood pressure (MAP), blood chemistry, intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral blood flow (CBF) and brain tissue oxygen (ptiO2) were assessed during the first hour and lesion volume at 2 days after ASDH.

EPO 20,000 IU/rat (i.v.) elevated ICP significantly. EPO at 200 and 2000 IU reduced lesion volume from 38.2 ± 0.6 mm3 (NaCl-treated group) to 28.5 ± 0.9 and 22.2 ± 1.3 mm3 (all p &lt; 0.05 vs. NaCl). Cortical application of 0.02 IU EPO after ASDH evacuation reduced injury from 36.0 ± 5.2 to 11.2 ± 2.1 mm3 (p = 0.007), whereas 0.2 IU had no effect (38.0 ± 9.0 mm3). The highest dose of both application routes (i.v. 20,000 IU; cortical 2 IU) enlarged the ASDH-induced damage significantly to 46.5 ± 1.7 and 67.9 ± 10.4 mm3 (all p &lt; 0.05 vs. NaCl). In order to test whether Tween-20, a solvent of EPO formulation ‘NeoRecomon®’ was responsible for adverse effects two groups were treated with NaCl or Tween-20 after the evacuation of ASDH, but no difference in lesion volume was detected.

In conclusion, EPO is neuroprotective in a model of ASDH in rats and was most efficacious at a very low dose in combination with subdural blood removal. High systemic and topically applied concentrations caused adverse effects on lesion size which were partially due to increased ICP. Thus, patients with traumatic ASDH could be treated with cortically applied EPO but with caution concerning concentration.

AB  - Background
Previous literature suggests that cell death pathways activated after cerebral ischemia differ between the sexes. While caspase-dependent mechanisms predominate in the female brain, caspase-independent cell death induced by the activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) predominates in the male brain. PARP-1 gene deletion decreases infarction volume in the male brain, but paradoxically increases damage in PARP-1 knockout females.
Purpose
This study examined stroke-induced changes in NAD+, a key energy molecule involved in PARP-1 activation in both sexes.
Methods
Mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion and NAD+ levels were assessed. Caspase-3 activity and nuclear translocation were assessed 6 h after ischemia. In additional cohorts, Nicotinamide (500 mg/kg i.p.) a precursor of NAD+ or vehicle was administered and infarction volume was measured 24 h after ischemia.
Results
Males have higher baseline NAD+ levels than females. Significant stroke-induced NAD+ depletion occurred in males and ovariectomized females but not in intact females. PARP-1 deletion prevented the stroke-induced loss in NAD+ in males, but worsened NAD+ loss in PARP-1 deficient females. Preventing NAD+ loss with nicotinamide reduced infarct in wild-type males and PARP-1 knockout mice of both sexes, with no effect in WT females. Caspase-3 activity was significantly increased in PARP-1 knockout females compared to males and wild-type females, this was reversed with nicotinamide.
Conclusions
Sex differences exist in baseline and stroke-induced NAD+ levels. Nicotinamide protected males and PARP knockout mice, but had minimal effects in the wild-type female brain. This may be secondary to differences in energy metabolism between the sexes.

KW  - quadrupedal locomotion

AB  - Despite the obvious importance of inter-girdle coordination for quadrupedal locomotion in terrestrial mammals, its organization remains poorly understood. Here, we evaluated cycle and phase durations, as well as footfall patterns of four intact adult cats trained to walk on a transverse split-belt treadmill that could independently control fore- and hindlimb speed. When the hindlimbs walked at faster speeds than the forelimbs, an equal rhythm was always maintained between the fore- and hindlimbs, even at the highest fore–hindlimb speed ratio of 1:3 (0.4:1.2 m/s). The locomotor pattern adjusted through changes in both hindlimb stance and swing phase durations, whereas only the forelimb stance phase was affected. In such conditions, when fore- and hindlimb values were compared to those obtained at matched speeds during tied-belt walking (i.e. predicted values based on treadmill speed), hindlimb cycle, stance and swing durations were consistently longer than predicted. On the other hand, forelimb cycle and stance durations were shorter than predicted but only at the highest split-belt speed ratios. Forelimb swing durations were as predicted based on front-belt speed. The sequence of footfall pattern when hindlimb speed was faster was identical to tied-belt walking. In stark contrast, when the forelimbs walked at slightly faster speeds than the hindlimbs, the rhythm between the fore- and hindlimbs broke down. In such conditions, the locomotor pattern was adjusted through changes in stance and swing phase durations in both the fore- and hindlimbs. When the rhythm between the fore- and hindlimbs broke down, hindlimb cycle and phase durations were similar to predicted values, whereas forelimb values were shorter than predicted. Moreover, several additional sequences of footfall patterns were observed. Therefore, the results clearly demonstrate the existence of a bidirectional, asymmetric, and flexible control of inter-girdle coordination during quadrupedal locomotion in the intact adult cat.

AB  - Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of the hippocampus depends on the activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), which can be regulated by Ca2+-dependent release of d-serine from astrocytes. The detailed mechanism underlying astrocytic d-serine release is still unknown. In hippocampal slices prepared from Sprague–Dawley rats, we found that clamping astrocytic [Ca2+] at 100–150 nM or puffing artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) into the extracellular space (weak mechanical stimulation) enhanced the synaptic activation of NMDARs. The enhancement was blocked by the NMDAR glycine site antagonist 5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid, glycine saturation, and infusion of astrocytes with d-amino acid oxidase and the serine racemase inhibitor l-erythro-3-hydroxyaspartate, suggesting the involvement of astrocytic d-serine release. Intracellular 100–150 nM [Ca2+] or puffing ACSF stimulated astrocytes to generate d-serine-containing large vesicles (1–3 μm), exocytotic fusion of which released d-serine. The formation of astrocytic large vesicles involved the intracellular fusion of small vesicles and/or other organelles. Spontaneous fusion of large vesicles occurred occasionally in astrocytes at rest, contributing to baseline d-serine levels, which increased the rising slope of NMDAR post-burst potentiation (PBP) without altering the PBP peak amplitude. Thus, under physiological conditions, astrocytic d-serine release by large vesicles facilitated weak theta-burst (TBS consisting of five bursts), but not strong TBS (TBS consisting of 10 bursts) stimulation-induced LTP.

AB  - Accumulating evidence suggests that adolescence represents a sensitive period during which social stressors influence adult behavior and stress reactivity. However, relatively little is known about the impact of social stress in adolescence on behaviors or stress reactivity in females. In this study, we exposed adolescent or adult female rats to the repeated social stress of defeat for seven consecutive days. Repeated defeat resulted in distinctly different behavioral repertoires during defeat in adolescent compared to adult female rats. Adolescent females exhibited more play and avoidant behaviors and adult females exhibited more active and aggressive behaviors toward the resident female. Examination of the short-term effects of social defeat using the Porsolt forced swim test (FST) indicated that adolescents, regardless of their exposure to social defeat, showed increased time immobile and decreased time swimming compared to adults. Adolescent rats exposed to defeat also exhibited increased climbing compared to their age-matched naïve counterparts. These effects dissipated with age. Interestingly, no effects of defeat were observed in adult females, however, when these females were re-assessed in the FST 30 days after the end of defeat, we observed increased swimming at the expense of climbing. Using exposure to a novel restraint to assess stress reactivity, we found that stress during adolescence and adulthood led to lower basal adrenocorticotropic hormone concentrations and that both stressed and control adolescent groups exhibited a delay in recovery in adulthood compared to stressed and control adult groups. Fos protein analysis further suggested that cortical/thalamic structures serve as potential substrates that mediate these long-term impacts of stress during adolescence. Thus, repeated social stress during adolescence produces different patterns of effects as compared with repeated social stress during adulthood.

AB  - Activation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) is a potential therapeutic strategy of neurological disorders. In this study, NSPCs of subventricular zone were isolated and cultured from platelet-derived growth factor-β-receptor-knockout (PDGFR-β−/−) mice of postnatal day 1 (P1) and P28, and the roles of PDGFR-β were examined in these cells. In PDGFR-β-preserving control NSPCs, stem cell activities, such as numbers and diameters of secondary neurospheres, cell proliferation and survival rates, were significantly higher in P1 NSPCs than those in P28 NSPCs. In PDGFR-β−/− NSPCs, most of these parameters were decreased as compared with age-matched controls. Among them, the decrease of secondary neurosphere formation was most striking in P1 and P28 PDGFR-β−/− NSPCs and in P28 control NSPCs as compared with P1 control NSPCs. PCR-array and following quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses demonstrated that expressions of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) and exons IV–IX of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were decreased, and noggin was increased in P1 PDGFR-β−/− as compared with P1 controls. Addition of BDNF rescued the number and diameter of secondary neurospheres in P1 PDGFR-β−/− NSPCs to similar levels as controls. The expressions of PDGFs and PDGFRs in control NSPCs were increased along with the differentiation-induction, where phosphorylated PDGFR-β was co-localized with neuronal and astrocyte differentiation markers. In controls, the neuronal differentiation was decreased, and the glial differentiation was increased from P1 to P28 NSPCs. Compared with P1 controls, neuronal differentiation was reduced in P1 PDGFR-β−/− NSPCs, whereas glial differentiation was comparable between the two genotypes. These results suggest that PDGFR-β signaling is important for the self-renewal and multipotency of NSPCs, particularly in neonatal NSPCs. BDNF, FGF2, and noggin may be involved in the effects of PDGFR-β signaling in these cells. Accordingly, the activation of PDGFR-β in NSPCs may be a novel therapeutic strategy of neurological diseases.

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin abundantly expressed in several areas of the central nervous system (CNS) and is known to induce a lasting potentiation of synaptic efficacy, to enhance specific learning and memory processes. BDNF is one of the key molecules modulating brain plasticity and it affects cognitive deficit associated with aging and neurodegenerative disease. Several studies have shown an altered BDNF production and secretion in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases but also in mood disorders like depression, eating disorders and schizophrenia. Plasma BDNF is also a biomarker of impaired memory and general cognitive function in aging women.

Gonadal steroids are involved in the regulation of several CNS processes, specifically mood, affective and cognitive functions during fertile life and reproductive aging. These observations lead many scientists to investigate a putative co-regulation between BDNF and gonadal and/or adrenal steroids and their relationship with gender difference in the incidence of mental diseases.

This overview aims to summarize the current knowledge on the correlation between BDNF expression/function and both gonadal (progesterone, estrogens, and testosterone) and adrenal hormones (mainly cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)) with relevance in clinical application.

AB  - Excitability, neurite outgrowth and their specification are very important features in the establishment of neuronal differentiation. We have studied a conditioned medium (CM) from sciatic nerve which is able to induce a neuronal-like differentiation of PC12 cells. Previously, we have demonstrated that supplementing this CM with a generic inhibitor (k252a), which mainly inhibits tropomyosin-related kinase receptors (Trk receptors) and protein kinase C (PKC), caused neurite elongation, sodium current induction and axon development.

In the present work, we are showing that the enhancement of neurite length and induction of sodium currents induced by CM + k252a were prevented by ErbB receptor inhibition. Additionally, we demonstrated that specific inhibition of PKC produced a similar effect to that exerted by k252a in CM-treated cells, specifically by increasing the percentage of differentiated cells with long neurites and inducing sodium currents. Moreover, CM changed the mRNA levels for ErbB2 and ErbB3 increasing them 6- and 36-folds respectively compared to their control. The inclusion of k252a with CM changed the ErbB1, ErbB2 and ErbB3 mRNA proportions increasing those eight-, seven- and fivefolds respectively.

From this point, it is clear that appropriate ErbB receptor levels and PKC inhibition are necessary to enhance the effect of the CM in inducing the neuronal-like differentiation of PC12 cells. In summary, we demonstrated the involvement of ErbB receptors in the regulation of neurite elongation and sodium current induction in PC12 cells and propose that these processes could be initiated by ErbB receptors followed by a fine regulation of PKC signaling. These findings might implicate a novel interplay between ErbB receptors and PKC in the regulation of these molecular mechanisms.

AB  - Athletes exhibit better anticipation abilities than novices. However, it is not known whether this difference is related to different visual perceptions between them and which neural elements are involved in producing this difference. Fifteen elite basketball players and 15 novices participated in an action anticipation task with basketball free throw. Accurate rate for anticipation and gaze behavior were analyzed. Functional brain activity was recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found that the accurate rate for anticipation was higher in athletes than that in novices. Athletes showed more stable gaze fixation than novices and the locus of fixation was reliable in athletes but not in novices. Athletes showed higher activity in inferior parietal lobule and inferior frontal gyrus than novices during action anticipation. We conclude that the processes for action anticipation in elite athletes and novices are different and this difference is caused by different visual perceptions between them.

AB  - Introduction
It has been shown that patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms have abnormal processing of sensory information following stimulation in the oesophagus. In order to find less invasive stimuli to study visceral afferent processing and to further elaborate the gut–brain network in diabetes, we studied brain networks following rectal electrical stimulations.
Methods
Twelve type 1 diabetes patients with GI symptoms and twelve healthy controls were included. A standard ambulatory 24-h electrocardiography was performed. 122-channel-evoked brain potentials to electrical stimulation in the rectum were recorded. Brain source-connectivity analysis was done. GI symptoms were assessed with the gastroparesis cardinal symptom index and quality of life (QOL) with SF-36. Any changes in brain source connectivity were correlated to duration of the disease, heart beat-to-beat intervals (RRs), clinical symptoms, and QOL of the patients.
Results
Diabetic patients with GI symptoms showed changes relative to controls in the operculum–cingulate network with the operculum source localized deeper and more anterior (P ⩽ 0.001) and the cingulate source localized more anterior (P = 0.03). The shift of operculum source was correlated with the duration of the disease, severity of GI symptoms, and decreased RR (P &lt; 0.05). The shift of the cingulate source was correlated with the mental QOL (P = 0.04). In healthy controls, the contribution of the cingulate source to the network was higher than the contribution of the operculum source (P ⩽ 0.001), whereas in patients the contribution of the two sources was comparable.
Conclusion
This study gives further evidence for CNS involvement in diabetes. Since network reorganizations were correlated to GI symptoms, irregularities of rectal-evoked potentials can be viewed as a proxy for abnormal bottom-up visceral afferent processing. The network changes might serve as a biomarker for disturbed sensory visceral processing of GI symptoms in diabetes patients.

AB  - It has been demonstrated that rat litter size affects the immune cell response, but it is not known whether the long-term effects aggravate age-related memory impairments or microglial-associated changes. To that end, we raised sedentary Wistar rats that were first suckled in small or large litters (6 or 12 pups/dam, respectively), then separated into groups of 2–3 rats from the 21st post-natal day to study end. At 4 months (young adult) or 23 months (aged), all individual rats were submitted to spatial memory and object identity recognition tests, and then sacrificed. Brain sections were immunolabeled with anti-IBA-1 antibodies to selectively identify microglia/macrophages. Microglial morphological changes in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus were estimated based on three-dimensional reconstructions. The cell number and laminar distribution in the dentate gyrus was estimated with the stereological optical fractionator method. We found that, compared to young rat groups, aged rats from large litters showed significant increases in the number of microglia in all layers of the dentate gyrus. Compared to the microglia in all other groups, microglia in aged individuals from large litters showed a significantly higher degree of tree volume expansion, branch base diameter thickening, and cell soma enlargement. These morphological changes were correlated with an increase in the number of microglia in the molecular layer. Young adult individuals from small litters exhibited preserved intact object identity recognition memory and all other groups showed reduced performance in both spatial and object identity recognition tasks. We found that, in large litters, brain development was, on average, associated with permanent changes in the innate immune system in the brain, with a significant impact on the microglial homeostasis of aged rats.

AB  - Neuronal network remodeling during critical periods of sensory development might be accompanied by alterations in hypothalamic cell populations. MicroRNAs play a central role in regulating neuronal function, including neural stem cell proliferation, and neuronal migration, maturation and integration into viable circuits by modulating different mRNA targets. Here we investigated the role of miR-138 in cell proliferation and migration in a neuron-enriched hypothalamic cell culture prepared from chicks on embryonic day 16. Ectopic expression of miR-138 enhanced hypothalamic cell migration, but did not affect cell proliferation. As a potential mechanism for miR-138’s effect on cell migration, we investigated reelin (Reln) as a direct target of miR-138. Luciferase reporter assay and Ago2-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed direct binding of miR-138 to the Reln 3′-untranslated region. Ectopic miR-138 abolished Reln levels in hypothalamic cells and enhanced their migration, similar to Reln-antisense DNA. Furthermore, inhibition of Reln expression by miR-138 led to decreased phosphorylation level of the key component of Reln-regulated signaling cascades, Disabled 1. These findings describe miR-138 as a novel regulator of hypothalamic cell migration, acting at least in part via inhibition of Reln expression and leading to the inactivation of Reln signals.

AB  - Abstract
Although elevated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 levels were highly related to the degradation of tight junction (TJ) proteins and basal lamina and neuronal injury after ischemia, until very recently, little experimental evidence was available to test the role of the MMP-2 knockout (KO) in blood–brain-barrier (BBB) injury and the development of hemorrhage transformation (HT). Here, we assessed the role of the MMP-2 KO in BBB injury, HT and other brain injuries after 1 h of ischemia and 23 h of reperfusion. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed in MMP-2 KO mice. Reperfusion was started 1 h after the onset of MCAO. All mice were sacrificed 24 h after the MCAO. MMP-2 deficiency reduced the decrease in protein levels of collagen IV and cellular membrane occludin (p &lt; 0.01 and 0.05 vs. wild-type (WT), respectively) and attenuated increase in cytosol occludin level in ischemic brain (p &lt; 0.01 vs. WT). The hemorrhage volume and brain infarction were significantly decreased in both the cortex and striatum in the MMP-2 KO mice (p &lt; 0.01 vs. WT). The MMP-2 KO also had reduced brain swelling in the cortex and improved neurological deficits (p &lt; 0.01 vs. WT). These studies provide direct evidence that targeting MMP-2 will effectively protect against collagen and occludin loss and HT after ischemia and reperfusion.

Reconsolidation refers to the destabilization/re-stabilization process upon memory reactivation. However, the parameters needed to induce reconsolidation remain unclear. Here we evaluated the capacity of memory retrieval to induce reconsolidation of object recognition memory in rats. To assess whether retrieval is indispensable to trigger reconsolidation, we injected muscimol in the perirhinal cortex to block retrieval, and anisomycin (ani) to impede reconsolidation. We observed that ani impaired reconsolidation in the absence of retrieval. Therefore, stored memory underwent reconsolidation even though it was not recalled. These results indicate that retrieval and reconsolidation of object recognition memory are independent processes.

AB  - Abstract
In this review we discuss recent advances in the understanding of the development of forebrain projections attending to their origin, fate determination, and axon guidance. Major forebrain connections include callosal, corticospinal, corticothalamic and thalamocortical projections. Although distinct transcriptional programs specify these subpopulations of projecting neurons, the mechanisms involved in their axonal development are similar. Guidance by short- and long-range molecular cues, interaction with intermediate target populations and activity-dependent mechanisms contribute to their development. Moreover, some of these connections interact with each other showing that the development of these axonal tracts is a well-orchestrated event. Finally, we will recapitulate recent discoveries that challenge the field of neural wiring that show that these forebrain connections can be changed once formed. The field of reprogramming has arrived to postmitotic cortical neurons and has showed us that forebrain connectivity is not immutable and might be changed by manipulations in the transcriptional program of matured cells.

AB  - Abstract
Harnessing the regenerative capabilities of endogenous precursor cells in the spinal cord may be a useful tool for clinical treatments aimed at replacing cells lost as a consequence of disease or trauma. To better understand the proliferative properties and differentiation potential of the adult spinal cord after injury, we used a mouse model of compression spinal cord injury (SCI). After injury, adult mice were administered BrdU to label mitotic cells and sacrificed at different time-points for immunohistochemical analysis. Our data show that the rate of proliferation increased in all regions of the spinal cord 1 day after injury, peaked after 3 days, and remained elevated for at least 14 days after injury. Proliferation was greater at the injury epicenter than in rostral and caudal adjacent spinal segments. The number of proliferative cells and rate of proliferation varied between dorsal and ventral regions of the spinal cord and between the gray and white matter. Newly generated cells expressed markers for progenitor cells (Nestin and Olig2), oligodendrocytes (Sox10), astrocytes (S100b and glial fibrillary acidic protein), and microglia (Iba1), but not neuronal markers (Map2 and NeuN). Marker expression varied with regard to the dorso-ventral region, rostro-caudal proximity to the injury epicenter, and time after injury. At early time-points after injury, BrdU+ cells mainly expressed microglial/macrophage and astrocytic markers, while at these same time-points in the control spinal cord the mitotic cells predominately expressed oligodendrocyte and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell markers. The profile of proliferation and cell fate marker expression indicates that after moderate compression, the spinal cord has the capacity to generate a variety of glial cells but not neurons, and that this pattern is space and time specific. Future studies should focus on ways to control proliferation and cell fate after injury to aid the development of cell replacement treatments for SCI.

AB  - Abstract
This study was done to investigate the effects of acute intermittent hypoxia (IH) on metabolic factors associated with energy balance and body weight, and on hypothalamic satiety-inducing pathways. Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were exposed to either 8 h IH or normoxic control conditions. Food intake, locomotion and body weights were examined after IH. Additionally, plasma levels of leptin, adiponectin corticosterone, insulin and blood glucose were measured following exposure to IH. Furthermore, adipose tissue was removed and analyzed for leptin and adiponectin content. Finally, the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) was assessed for alterations in protein signaling associated with satiety. IH reduced body weight, food intake and active cycle locomotion without altering adipose tissue mass. Leptin protein content was reduced while adiponectin content was elevated in adipose tissue after IH. Plasma concentration of leptin was significantly increased while adiponectin decreased after IH. No changes were found in plasma corticosterone, insulin and blood glucose. In ARC, phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) expression were elevated. In addition, POMC-expressing neurons were activated as determined by immediate early gene FRA-1/2 expression. Finally, ERK1/2 and its phosphorylation were reduced in response to IH. These data suggest that IH induces significant alterations to body energy balance through changes in the secretion of leptin which exert effects on satiety-inducing pathways within the hypothalamus.

Here, we review the current knowledge regarding the signaling molecules whose flow from receptor to specific behavior has been characterized. Discussing the molecules utilized by mice, insects, and the worm, we focus on how each organism has optimized its reception system to suit its living style. We also highlight how the production of these signaling molecules is regulated, an area in which considerable progress has been recently made.

AB  - Abstract
Hypobaric hypoxia (HH), an environmental stress resulting from ascent to high altitude, affects perception, memory, judgment, and attention, resulting in degradation of many aspects of normal functioning. Alpha 2A adrenergic agonist, guanfacine proved to be beneficial in the amelioration of neurological outcomes of many neuropsychiatric disorders involving adrenergic imbalance and neurodegeneration. Adrenergic dysregulation and neuronal damage have been implicated in hypoxia-induced cognitive deficits, however, efficacy of guanfacine as a countermeasure for HH-induced cognitive decline remains to be evaluated. We, therefore, have studied the effect of this drug on the HH-induced cognitive deficits, adrenergic dysfunction and neuronal damage. Rats were exposed to HH at a simulated altitude of 25,000 feet for 7 days and received an IM injection of either saline or guanfacine at a dose of 1 mg/kg. Adrenergic transmission was evaluated by biomarkers i.e. norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) by biochemical and immunohistochemical assays. Spine and dendritic morphology of pyramidal neurons in layer II of medial PFC was studied using Golgi–Cox staining and Neurolucida neuronal tracing. The cognitive performance was assessed by Delayed Alternation Task using a T-Maze. There was a significant reduction in HH-induced increases in NE, DA and TH levels with guanfacine treatment. Guanfacine rescued HH-induced dendritic atrophy and mushroom type spine loss. The spatial working memory deficits induced by HH were significantly ameliorated with guanfacine treatment. Furthermore, the cognitive performance showed a positive correlation with dendritic arbors and spine numbers. These results showed that the HH-induced cognitive decline is associated with adrenergic dysregulation and neuronal damage in layer II of medial PFC, and that guanfacine treatment during HH ameliorated these functional and morphological deficits. The study suggests a potential role of the alpha-2A adrenergic agonist, guanfacine, in amelioration of PFC dysfunction caused by high altitude exposure.

AB  - Abstract
To our knowledge, the present data are the first to demonstrate that activation of membrane estrogen receptors (mERs) abolishes opioid receptor-like 1 (ORL1) receptor-mediated analgesia via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent non-genomic mechanisms. Estrogen was shown previously to both attenuate ORL1-mediated antinociception and down-regulate the ORL1 gene expression. The present study investigated whether non-genomic mechanisms contribute to estrogen-induced attenuation of ORL1-mediated antinociception by the mERs GPR30, Gq-coupled mER, ERα, and ERβ. E2BSA [β-estradiol-6-(O-carboxymethyl)oxime: bovine serum albumin] (0.5 mM), a membrane impermeant analog of estradiol, injected intrathecally immediately prior to orphanin FQ (OFQ;10 nmol), the endogenous ligand for the ORL1 receptor, abolished OFQ’s antinociceptive effect in both male and ovariectomized (OVX) female rats, assessed using the heat-induced tail-flick assay. This effect was not altered by protein synthesis inhibitor, anisomycin (125 μg), given intrathecally 15 min prior to E2BSA and OFQ. Intrathecal application of selective receptor agonists permitted the relative contributions of various estrogen receptors in mediating this blockade of the antinociceptive response of OFQ. Activation of GPR30, Gq-mER, ERα, but not ERβ abolished ORL1-mediated antinociception in males and OVX females. E2BSA produced a parallel and significant increase in the phosphorylation of ERK 2 only in OVX females, and pre-treatment with MEK/ERK 1/2 inhibitor, U0126 (10 μg), blocked the mER-mediated abolition of ORL1-mediated antinociception in OVX females. Taken together, the data are consistent with the interpretations that mER activation attenuates ORL1-mediated antinociception through a non-genomic, ERK 2-dependent mechanism in females.

AB  - Abstract
The dopamine (DA), noradrenalin (NA) and serotonin (5-HT) monoaminergic systems are deeply involved in cognitive processes via their influence on cortical and subcortical regions. The widespread distribution of these monoaminergic networks is one of the main difficulties in analyzing their functions and interactions. To address this complexity, we assessed whether inter-individual differences in monoamine tissue contents of various brain areas could provide information about their functional relationships. We used a sensitive biochemical approach to map endogenous monoamine tissue content in 20 rat brain areas involved in cognition, including 10 cortical areas and examined correlations within and between the monoaminergic systems. Whereas DA content and its respective metabolite largely varied across brain regions, the NA and 5-HT contents were relatively homogenous. As expected, the tissue content varied among individuals. Our analyses revealed a few specific relationships (10%) between the tissue content of each monoamine in paired brain regions and even between monoamines in paired brain regions. The tissue contents of NA, 5-HT and DA were inter-correlated with a high incidence when looking at a specific brain region. Most correlations found between cortical areas were positive while some cortico-subcortical relationships regarding the DA, NA and 5-HT tissue contents were negative, in particular for DA content. In conclusion, this work provides a useful database of the monoamine tissue content in numerous brain regions. It suggests that the regulation of these neuromodulatory systems is achieved mainly at the terminals, and that each of these systems contributes to the regulation of the other two.

AB  - Abstract
Cervical proprioception plays a key role in postural control, but its specific contribution is controversial. Postural impairment was shown in whiplash injuries without demonstrating the sole involvement of the cervical spine. The consequences of degenerative cervical spine diseases are underreported in posture-related scientific literature in spite of their high prevalence. No report has focused on the two different mechanisms underlying cervicobrachial pain: herniated discs and spondylosis. This study aimed to evaluate postural control of two groups of patients with degenerative cervical spine diseases with or without optokinetic stimulation before and after surgical treatment. Seventeen patients with radiculopathy were recruited and divided into two groups according to the spondylotic or discal origin of the nerve compression. All patients and a control population of 31 healthy individuals underwent a static posturographic test with 12 recordings; the first four recordings with the head in 0° position: eyes closed, eyes open without optokinetic stimulation, with clockwise and counter clockwise optokinetic stimulations. These four sensorial situations were repeated with the head rotated 30° to the left and to the right. Patients repeated these 12 recordings 6 weeks postoperatively. None of the patients reported vertigo or balance disorders before or after surgery. Prior to surgery, in the eyes closed condition, the herniated disc group was more stable than the spondylosis group. After surgery, the contribution of visual input to postural control in a dynamic visual environment was reduced in both cervical spine diseases whereas in a stable visual environment visual contribution was reduced only in the spondylosis group. The relative importance of visual and proprioceptive inputs to postural control varies according to the type of pathology and surgery tends to reduce visual contribution mostly in the spondylosis group.

AB  - Abstract
N-Acetyl cysteine, a glutathione precursor, has been shown to benefit patients with Alzheimer’s disease and reduce the symptoms of traumatic brain injury in soldiers. Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease are both characterized by stress from protein misfolding, or proteotoxicity. We have developed a high-throughput model of proteotoxicity by treating neuroblastoma N2a cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and performing three independent assays for viability. Our previous study showed that N-acetyl cysteine protects N2a cells against two sequential treatments of MG132 and raises glutathione levels in a two-hit model of synergistic neurodegeneration. In the present study, however, N-acetyl cysteine was found to reduce the toxicity of a single hit of MG132 independent of its effect on glutathione. All three viability assays confirmed this protection. We measured heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) levels because Hsp70 is a protective chaperone that helps refold proteins or guides ubiquitinated proteins toward degradation by the proteasome. Hsp70 levels were higher in MG132-treated cells when N-acetyl cysteine was applied. No parallel change in heat shock cognate 70 (Hsc70) was elicited. Inhibition of Hsp70/Hsc70 activity with VER 155008 attenuated the protection afforded by N-acetyl cysteine in a dose–responsive manner. MG132 induced a large rise in ubiquitinated proteins and N-acetyl cysteine reduced this effect. Consistent with the chaperone functions of Hsp70, VER 155008 also prevented the reduction in ubiquitin-conjugated proteins by N-acetyl cysteine. These data reveal a new role for N-acetyl cysteine: this compound may reduce misfolded protein levels and ameliorate proteotoxicity through heat shock proteins. These findings broaden the potential mechanisms of action for this dietary supplement in neurodegenerative proteinopathies.

AB  - Abstract
Numerous studies have reported that the hippocampus in schizophrenia patients is reduced in volume compared to the normal population. Antipsychotic medications have had mixed benefits in maintaining hippocampal volume or reversing volume loss. Recent evidence indicates that routine aerobic exercise represents a promising intervention for reversing hippocampal loss and cognitive deficits. In the present study, we measured the effects of chronic treatment with olanzapine and daily exercise on the hippocampal volumes of rats. Adult female rats were treated during the week with either olanzapine (10 mg/kg) or vehicle for 9 consecutive weeks. Subgroups of animals were provided access to exercise running wheels for 1 or 3 h per day during the same period, or were sedentary. Metabolic indices, including glucose tolerance, were measured on a weekly basis. At the conclusion of the study, brains were perfused and hippocampal sections were Nissl stained. Total hippocampal volume was measured using the Cavalieri estimator. Treatment with olanzapine caused a significant decrease in hippocampal volume in sedentary rats. However, exercise was able to reverse most of this volume loss. The hippocampal sub-regions of the dentate gyrus and CA1 were most strongly affected by olanzapine and exercise. Of interest, there was a strong and highly significant negative correlation between glucose intolerance and hippocampal volume, whereby greater glucose intolerance was associated with a smaller hippocampal volume. These findings indicate that exercise may have beneficial effects on the hippocampus when antipsychotic medication can contribute to changes in volume.

AB  - Abstract
Brain machine interfaces (BMI) have become important in systems neuroscience with the goal to restore motor function in paralyzed patients. We assess the current ability of BMI devices to move objects. The topics discussed include: (1) the bits of information generated by a BMI signal, (2) the limitations of including more neurons for generating a BMI signal, (3) the superiority of a BMI signal using single cells versus electroencephalography, (4) plasticity and BMI, (5) the selection of a neural code for generating BMI, (6) the suppression of body movements during BMI, and (7) the role of vision in BMI. We conclude that further research on understanding how the brain generates movement is necessary before BMI can become a reasonable option for paralyzed patients.

AB  - Abstract
The Kv7/M current is one of the major mechanisms controlling neuronal excitability, which can be modulated by activation of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) via distinct signaling pathways. Membrane microdomains known as lipid rafts have been implicated in the specificity of various cell signaling pathways. The aim of this study was to understand the role of lipid rafts in the specificity of Kv7/M current modulation by activation of GPCR. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), often used to disrupt the integrity of lipid rafts, significantly reduced the bradykinin receptor (B2R)-induced but not muscarinic receptor (M1R)-induced inhibition of the Kv7/M current. B2R and related signaling molecules but not M1R were found in caveolin-containing raft fractions of the rat superior cervical ganglia. Furthermore, activation of B2R resulted in translocation of additional B2R into the lipid rafts, which was not observed for the activation of M1R. The increase of B2R-induced intracellular Ca2+ was also greatly reduced after MβCD treatment. Finally, B2R but not M1R was found to interact with the IP3 receptor. In conclusion, the present study implicates an important role for lipid rafts in mediating specificity for GPCR-mediated inhibition of the Kv7/M current.

AB  - Abstract
The ability of local infusions of the alpha 7 nicotinic acetycholine receptor (α7 nAChR) partial agonist SSR180711 to evoke glutamate release in prefrontal cortex was determined in awake rats using a microelectrode array. Infusions of SSR180711 produced dose-dependent increases in glutamate levels. The lower dose (1.0 μg in 0.4 μL) evoked a rapid rise (∼1.0 s) in glutamate (1.41 ± 0.30 μM above baseline). The higher dose (5.0 μg) produced a similarly rapid, yet larger increase (3.51 ± 0.36 μM above baseline). After each dose, the glutamate signal was cleared to basal levels within 7–18 s. SSR180711-evoked glutamate was mediated by the α7 nAChR as co-infusion of the selective α7 nAChR antagonist α-bungarotoxin (10.0 μM) + SSR1808711 (5.0 μg) reduced the effect of 5.0 μg alone by 87% (2.62 vs. 0.35 μM). Finally, the clearance of the SSR180711 (5.0 μg)-evoked glutamate was bidirectionally affected by drugs that inhibited (threo-beta-benzyl-oxy-aspartate (TβOA), 100.0 μM) or facilitated (ceftriaxalone, 200 mg/kg, i.p.) excitatory amino acid transporters. TβOA slowed both the clearance (s) and rate of clearance (μM/s) by 10-fold, particularly at the mid-late stages of the return to baseline. Ceftriaxone reduced the magnitude of the SSR180711-evoked increase by 65%. These results demonstrate that pharmacological stimulation of α7 nAChRs within the prefrontal cortex is sufficient to evoke rapid yet transient increases in glutamate levels. Such increases may underlie the cognition-enhancing effects of the drug in animals; further justifying studies on the use of α7 nAChR-positive modulators in treating cognition-impairing disorders in humans.

AB  - Abstract
Extracellular local field potentials (LFPs) and multiunit activity (MUA) reflect the spatially integrated activity of multiple neurons in a given cortical structure. In the cat and primate visual cortices, these signals exhibit selectivity for visual stimulus features, such as orientation, direction of motion or spatial frequency. In the mouse visual cortex, a model which has been increasingly used in visual neuroscience, the visual stimulus selectivity of population signals has not been examined in detail. We recorded LFPs and MUA using multielectrode arrays and two derived measures, the high-pass filtered continuous MUA and the bipolar first spatial derivative of the LFP, in the visual cortex of isoflurane-anesthetized C57Bl/6 mice. We analyzed the onset latency and characterized the receptive fields in addition to the direction, orientation, and spatial and temporal frequency preferences of these signals. Population signals exhibited onset latencies as short as ∼30 ms and possessed receptive fields as large as ∼38° with MUA receptive fields smaller than those of LFPs. All four population signals exhibited similar spatial frequency preferences (∼0.1 cycles per degree) and temporal frequency preferences (∼1 cycle per second). However, for all population signals, spatial and frequency tunings were broad and orientation and direction of motion preferences were absent. The characterization of the visual stimulus selectivity of LFPs and MUA in the mouse visual cortex should provide information regarding their usability in characterizing stimulus properties and disclose possible limitations.

AB  - Abstract
Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are involved in the stress response and alterations in eCB signaling may contribute to the etiology of mood disorders. Exposure to chronic mild stress (CMS), a model of depression, produces downregulation of the cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptor in the hippocampus of male rats. However, it is unknown how this stress-induced change in CB1 levels affects eCB-mediated neurotransmission. In vitro, field potential recordings from CMS-exposed (21-days) rats were performed to assess the effects of stress on eCB-regulated glutamatergic neurotransmission in/on hippocampal area CA1. We observed that application of the CB1 agonist, WIN 55,212-5 (1 μM), in stress animals resulted in a ∼135% increase in excitatory neurotransmission, whereas CB1 activation in non-stress animals leads to a ∼30% decrease. However, during blockade of GABA(A) neurotransmission with picrotoxin, CB1 activation yielded a ∼35% decrease in stress animals. These findings indicate that CMS does not directly affect glutamatergic neurotransmission. Rather, CMS sensitizes CB1 function on GABAergic terminals, leading to less inhibition and an increase in excitatory neurotransmission. This finding is reinforced in that induction of weak long-term-potentiation (LTP) is enhanced in CMS-exposed animals compared to controls and this enhancement is CB1-dependent. Lastly, we observed that the LTP-blocking property of WIN 55,212-5 shifts from being glutamate-dependent in non-stress animals to being GABA-dependent in stress animals. These results effectively demonstrate that CMS significantly alters hippocampal eCB-mediated neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Abstract
Studies involving therapeutic combinations reveal an important benefit in the rehabilitation of neglect patients when compared to single therapies. In light of these observations our present work examines, in healthy individuals, sensorimotor and cognitive after-effects of prism adaptation and neck muscle vibration applied individually or simultaneously. We explored sensorimotor after-effects on visuo-manual open-loop pointing, visual and proprioceptive straight-ahead estimations. We assessed cognitive after-effects on the line bisection task. Fifty-four healthy participants were divided into six groups designated according to the exposure procedure used with each: ‘Prism’ (P) group; ‘Vibration with a sensation of body rotation’ (Vb) group; ‘Vibration with a move illusion of the LED’ (Vl) group; ‘Association with a sensation of body rotation’ (Ab) group; ‘Association with a move illusion of the LED’ (Al) group; and ‘Control’ (C) group. The main findings showed that prism adaptation applied alone or combined with vibration showed significant adaptation in visuo-manual open-loop pointing, visual straight-ahead and proprioceptive straight-ahead. Vibration alone produced significant after-effects on proprioceptive straight-ahead estimation in the Vl group. Furthermore all groups (except C group) showed a rightward neglect-like bias in line bisection following the training procedure. This is the first demonstration of cognitive after-effects following neck muscle vibration in healthy individuals. The simultaneous application of both methods did not produce significant greater after-effects than prism adaptation alone in both sensorimotor and cognitive tasks. These results are discussed in terms of transfer of sensorimotor plasticity to spatial cognition in healthy individuals.

AB  - Abstract
Individual differences in the locomotor response to novelty have been linked to basal differences in dopaminergic neurotransmission. Mesolimbic dopaminergic outputs are regulated by cholecystokinin (CCK), a neuropeptide implicated in anxiety. In turn, CCK expression is regulated by fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2), which has recently been identified as an endogenous regulator of anxiety. FGF2 binds to the high-affinity fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGF-R1) to regulate the development and maintenance of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). However, the relationship between the FGF and CCK systems in the VTA is not well understood. Therefore, we utilized the selectively-bred low-responder (bLR; high-anxiety) and high-responder (bHR; low-anxiety) rats to examine the effects of repeated (21-day) FGF2 treatment on CCK and FGF-R1 mRNA in the rostral VTA (VTAr). In vehicle-treated controls, both CCK and FGF-R1 mRNA levels were increased in the VTAr of bLR rats relative to bHR rats. Following FGF2 treatment, however, bHR–bLR differences in CCK and FGF-R1 mRNA expression were eliminated, due to decreased CCK mRNA levels in the VTAr of bLR rats and increased FGF-R1 expression in bHR rats. Differences after FGF2 treatment may denote distinct interactions between the CCK and FGF systems in the VTAr of bHR vs. bLR rats. Indeed, significant correlations between CCK and FGF-R1 mRNA expression were found in bHR, but not bLR rats. Colocalization studies suggest that CCK and FGF-R1 are coexpressed in some VTAr neurons. Taken together, our findings suggest that the FGF system is poised to modulate both CCK and FGF-R1 expression in the VTAr, which may be associated with individual differences in mesolimbic pathways associated with anxiety-like behavior.

AB  - Abstract
Sex differences in the visual system have been reported in aspects of human vision, such as color perception, peripheral vision and even in the activation of the primary visual cortex. Similarly sex differences have been identified in the visual system of laboratory animals such as monkeys and rats. On the other hand, environmental enrichment (EE) has long been known to affect visual tissues. Taking into consideration the variation in the experimental approaches concerning EE and the sex differences in the visual system, we investigated in male and female rats the serotonergic and dopaminergic effects of EE in the retina and the visual cortex at different time points (i.e. P0–25, P0–P90 and P90–P150). Early EE in adulthood increased the serotonergic activity of the male visual cortex and the female retina (P0–P90). In addition early enrichment (P0–P90) increased dopaminergic activity in the female retina and in the visual cortex of both sexes. Late enrichment increased the serotonergic activity in the retina and visual cortex of both sexes (P90–P150), but increased the dopaminergic activity in the visual cortex only in male animals. In the present study we expose marked sex differences in the neurochemistry of visual tissues and we demonstrate for the first time that EE can in fact modify the serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in the retina and visual cortex. Overall, the present study underpins the sex-dependent neurochemical status of the visual system and provides insights into the different mechanisms underlying visual processing in the two sexes.

AB  - Abstract
We have previously shown that anti-hyperalgesic effects of cannabinoid agonists under inflammatory condition are much greater in male than female, and that inflammatory cytokines upregulate cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) expression in male, but not female, trigeminal ganglia (TG) in a testosterone-dependent manner. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the testosterone-mediated regulation of peripheral CB1 expression. We hypothesized that testosterone upregulates CB1 through transcriptional modulation by androgen receptor (AR). Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, upregulated CB1 mRNA expression in TG of male rats. The cytokine-induced upregulation was prevented by the pretreatment with flutamide, a specific antagonist for AR, but not by ICI 182,780, a specific antagonist for estrogen receptor, suggesting that the effects of testosterone are not mediated by estradiol, a testosterone metabolite. The expression levels of AR and IL-1β receptors were comparable between male and female TG, suggesting that the male specific IL-1β effects on CB1 upregulation occurs downstream to these receptors. The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed AR binding to the CB1 promoter in the rat TG. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assay revealed that AR activated the CB1 gene in response to testosterone or dihydrotestosterone treatment. These experiments provided compelling evidence that testosterone regulates CB1 gene transcription in TG through AR following cytokine stimulation. These results should provide mechanistic bases for understanding cytokine–hormone–neuron interactions in peripheral cannabinoid systems, and have important clinical implications for pain patients in whom testosterone level is naturally low, gradually declining or pharmacologically compromised.

Using structural magnetic resonance imaging in a clinical scanner at 3.0 T, we describe results showing that following 12 weeks on a diet of 2% cholesterol, rabbits experience a significant increase in the volume of the third ventricle compared to rabbits on a diet of 0% cholesterol. Using time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography, we find cholesterol-fed rabbits also experience a decrease in the diameter of a number of cerebral blood vessels including the basilar, posterior communicating, and internal carotid arteries. Taken together, these data confirm that, despite the inability of dietary cholesterol to cross the blood–brain barrier, it does significantly enlarge ventricular volume and decrease cerebrovascular diameter in the rabbit – effects that are also seen in patients with Alzheimer’s disease.

AB  - Abstract
The effect of Parkinson’s disease (PD) on hand–eye coordination and corrective response control during reach-to-grasp tasks remains unclear. Moderately impaired PD patients (n = 9) and age-matched controls (n = 12) reached to and grasped a virtual rectangular object, with haptic feedback provided to the thumb and index fingertip by two 3-degree of freedom manipulanda. The object rotated unexpectedly on a minority of trials, requiring subjects to adjust their grasp aperture. On half the trials, visual feedback of finger positions disappeared during the initial phase of the reach, when feedforward mechanisms are known to guide movement. PD patients were tested without (OFF) and with (ON) medication to investigate the effects of dopamine depletion and repletion on eye–hand coordination online corrective response control. We quantified eye–hand coordination by monitoring hand kinematics and eye position during the reach. We hypothesized that if the basal ganglia are important for eye–hand coordination and online corrections to object perturbations, then PD patients tested OFF medication would show reduced eye–hand spans and impoverished arm-hand coordination responses to the perturbation, which would be further exasperated when visual feedback of the hand was removed. Strikingly, PD patients tracked their hands with their gaze, and their movements became destabilized when having to make online corrective responses to object perturbations exhibiting pauses and changes in movement direction. These impairments largely remained even when tested in the ON state, despite significant improvement on the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale. Our findings suggest that basal ganglia-cortical loops are essential for mediating eye–hand coordination and adaptive online responses for reach-to-grasp movements, and that restoration of tonic levels of dopamine may not be adequate to remediate this coordinative nature of basal ganglia-modulated function.

AB  - Abstract
Neurogenesis continues to occur in restricted regions of the brain throughout adulthood and can be modulated by dietary factors. Liquid or “soft” diets are commonly used for the administration of drugs in experimental models of disease, making it critical to determine whether dietary composition itself can affect neurogenesis. In this study Sprague–Dawley rats were fed either a liquid or a solid diet of identical composition from weaning until young adulthood. No differences in neuronal differentiation and survival of newly born cells were observed between rats that were fed a liquid diet and those that received a solid diet. However, a significant reduction in hippocampal cell proliferation was observed in the liquid diet-fed group, as assessed by the expression of two endogenous proliferation markers, Ki67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The method of feeding did not alter the basal function of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis in these animals, as no changes in circulating levels of corticosterone (CORT) were detected between liquid and solid diet-fed groups. There was also a significant reduction in cellular proliferation in the hypothalamus of liquid diet-fed rats, a brain region known to be involved in feeding-related behaviors. These findings indicate that liquid diets themselves can directly impact rates of cellular proliferation, but this does not seem to impact levels of overall neurogenesis in the adult brain.

AB  - Abstract
Exposure of mice to a brief light stimulus during their nocturnal active phase induces several simultaneous behavioral or physiological responses, including circadian rhythm phase shifts, a drop in core body temperature (Tc), suppression of locomotor activity and sleep. Each response is triggered by light, endures for a relatively fixed interval and does not require additional light for expression. The present studies address the ability of the psychostimulant drugs, methamphetamine (MA), modafinil (MOD) or caffeine (CAF), to modify the light-induced responses. Drug or vehicle (VEH) was injected at CT11 into constant dark-housed mice then exposed to 5-min 100 μW/cm2 light or no light at CT13. Controls (VEH/Light) showed approximately 60-min phase delays. In contrast, response was substantially attenuated by each drug (only 12–15 min delays). Under a 12-h light:12-h dark (LD12:12) photoperiod, VEH/light-treated mice experienced a Tc drop of about 1.3 °C coincident with locomotor suppression and both effects were abolished by drug pre-treatment. Each drug elevated activity during the post-injection interval, but there was also evidence for CAF-induced hypoactivity in the dark prior to the photic test stimulus. CAF acutely elevated Tc; MA acutely lowered it, but both drugs reduced Tc during the early dark (ZT12.5–ZT13). The ability of the psychostimulant drugs to block the several effects of light exposure is not the result of drug-induced hyperactivity. The results raise questions concerning the manner in which drugs, activity, sleep and Tc influence behavioral and physiological responses to light.

AB  - Abstract
Previous results from our lab suggest that hypofunctioning of the serotonergic (5-HT) dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) is involved in stress-induced opiate reinstatement. To further investigate the effects of morphine dependence and withdrawal on the 5-HT DRN system, we measured gene expression at the level of mRNA in the DRN during a model of morphine dependence, withdrawal and post withdrawal stress exposure in rats. Morphine pellets were implanted for 72 h and then either removed or animals were injected with naloxone to produce spontaneous or precipitated withdrawal, respectively. Animals exposed to these conditions exhibited withdrawal symptoms including weight loss, wet dog shakes and jumping behavior. Gene expression for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB), corticotrophin releasing-factor (CRF)-R1, CRF-R2, alpha 1 subunit of the GABAA receptor (GABAA-α1), μ-opioid receptor (MOR), 5-HT1A receptor, tryptophan hydroxylase2 (TPH2) and the 5-HT transporter was then measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction at multiple time-points across the model of morphine exposure, withdrawal and post withdrawal stress. Expression levels of BDNF, TrkB and CRF-R1 mRNA were decreased during both morphine exposure and following 7 days of withdrawal. CRF-R2 mRNA expression was elevated after 7 days of withdrawal. 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression was decreased following 3 h of morphine exposure, while TPH2 mRNA expression was decreased after 7 days of withdrawal with swim stress. There were no changes in the expression of GABAA-α1, MOR or 5-HT transporter mRNA. Collectively these results suggest that alterations in neurotrophin support, CRF-dependent stress signaling, 5-HT synthesis and release may underlie 5-HT DRN hypofunction that can potentially lead to stress-induced opiate relapse.

AB  - Abstract
Synaptic decay and neurodegeneration are hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease that are thought to precede dementia. Recently, we have reported that the first signs of neuritic dystrophy in a new transgenic mouse model of familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) called the “5xFAD” are axonal dystrophy followed by loss of spines on basal dendrites. The 5xFAD mouse has profound loss of layer 5 neurons by 12 months, and these initial structural insults appear between 4 and 6 months of age. Here, we test, for the first time, if synaptic failure of layer 5 neurons in the 5xFAD mouse precedes these structural changes. We used longitudinal, in vivo two-photon fluorescence imaging of bigenic 5xFAD/YFP mice to assess the overall structural stability of layer 5 neurons in young mice (age less than 14 weeks). We found these neurons to be structurally and morphologically sound. In parallel, we used in vitro, whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology of layer 5 pyramidal neurons, from mice aged 8–12 weeks, to reveal significant pre- and postsynaptic defects in these cells. Thus our data suggest that layer 5 neurons in the 5xFAD mouse model have synaptic deficits at an early time point, before any overt structural dystrophy, and that such synaptic failure, with co-temporal biochemical changes, may be an early step in neuronal loss.

AB  - Abstract
In the present study, we investigated the effects of lesions of A2 neurons of the commissural nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTS) alone or combined with the blockade of angiotensinergic mechanisms on the recovery of arterial pressure (AP) to hemorrhage in conscious rats. Male Holtzman rats (280–320 g) received an injection of anti-dopamine-beta-hydroxylase-saporin (12.6 ng/60 nl; cNTS/A2-lesion, n = 28) or immunoglobulin G (IgG)-saporin (12.6 ng/60 nl, sham, n = 24) into the cNTS and 15–21 days later had a stainless steel cannula implanted in the lateral ventricle. After 6 days, rats were submitted to hemorrhage (four blood withdrawals, 2 ml/300 g of body weight every 10 min). Both cNTS/A2-lesioned and sham rats had similar hypotension to hemorrhage (−62 ± 7 and −73 ± 7 mmHg, respectively), however cNTS/A2-lesioned rats rapidly recovered from hypotension (−5 ± 3 mmHg at 30 min), whereas sham rats did not completely recover until the end of the recording (−20 ± 3 mmHg at 60 min). Losartan (angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonist) injected intracerebroventricularly (100 μg/1 μl) or intravenously (i.v.) (10 mg/kg of body weight) impaired the recovery of AP in cNTS/A2-lesioned rats (−24 ± 6 and −35 ± 7 mmHg at 30 min, respectively). In sham rats, only i.v. losartan affected the recovery of AP (−39 ± 6 mmHg at 60 min). The results suggest that lesion of the A2 neurons in the cNTS facilitates the activation of the angiotensinergic pressor mechanisms in response to hemorrhage.

AB  - Abstract
Neuroinflammation plays an important role in nerve-injury-induced neuropathic pain, but the explicit molecular mechanisms of neuroinflammation in neuropathic pain remain unclear. As one of the most critical inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) has been regarded as broadly involved in the pathology of neuropathic pain. The inflammasome caspase-1 platform is one primary mechanism responsible for the maturation of IL-1β. Lipoxins, a type of endogenous anti-inflammatory lipid, have proved to be effective in relieving neuropathic pain behaviors. The present study was designed to examine whether the inflammasome caspase-1 IL-1β platform is involved in chronic constriction injury (CCI)-induced neuropathic pain and in lipoxin-induced analgesia. After rats were subjected to the CCI surgery, mature IL-1β was significantly increased in the ipsilateral spinal cord, and the inflammasome platform consisting of NALP1 (NAcht leucine-rich-repeat protein 1), caspase-1 and ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-activating recruitment domain) was also activated in spinal astrocytes and neurons, especially at the superficial laminae of the spinal dorsal horn; The aspirin-triggered-15-epi-lipoxin A4 (ATL), which shares the potent actions of the endogenous lipoxins, was administered to the CCI rats. Repeated intrathecal injection with ATL markedly attenuated the CCI-induced thermal hyperalgesia and significantly inhibited NALP1 inflammasome activation, caspase-1 cleavage, and IL-1β maturation. These results suggested that spinal NALP1 inflammasome was involved in the CCI-induced neuropathic pain and that the analgesic effect of ATL was associated with suppressing NALP1 inflammasome activation.

AB  - Abstract
In the previous report (Sonia Angeline et al., 2012), we showed an altered expression of protective proteins in rotenone-induced Parkinson’s disease (PD)-like rat model. This model exhibited a marked attenuation in the expression of parkin, C terminus Hsp70 interacting protein (CHIP) and PARK 7 protein (DJ1) while enhanced levels of caspases and ubiquitin were seen. Herein, we confirmed the neuroprotective role of sesamol and naringenin individually on rotenone-induced rodent model of PD. Rotenone administration was given for 11 days to generate the PD model (Sonia Angeline et al., 2012). From 11th day onward individual doses of sesamol (15 mg/kg) and naringenin (10 mg/kg) drugs were given orally to the rotenone PD rat model for 10 consecutive days. The impact of drugs markedly improved the motor skills, body weight, expression of parkin, DJ1, tyrosine hydroxylase and CHIP compared to the group treated with rotenone alone in the striatum and substantia nigra. These results were correlated with the reduction in caspase and ubiquitin levels by immunostaining and immunoblotting. Moreover, improved morphology and survivability of neurons were seen upon sesamol and naringenin treatment in the same rat PD model. Further we confirmed the efficacy of neuroprotective biomolecule administration on muscle from the above PD model and observed the restoration in muscle morphology, elevated level of parkin, DJ1, differential expression of heat shock proteins and reduced cell death. To conclude, for the first time we are demonstrating the comprehensive role of sesamol and naringenin (rotenone-induced PD model) in neuro and myoprotection that would have great clinical significance.

AB  - Abstract
Neonatal hypoxia–ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) remains a major cause of brain damage, leading to high disability and mortality rates in neonates. In vitro studies have shown that hesperidin, a flavanone glycoside found abundantly in citrus fruits, acts as an antioxidant. Although hesperidin has been considered as a potential treatment for HIE, its effects have not been fully evaluated. In this study, the protective effect of hesperidin pretreatment against hypoxia–ischemic (HI) brain injury and possible signal pathways were investigated using in vivo and in vitro models. In vivo HI model employed unilateral carotid ligation in postnatal day 7 rat with exposure to 8% hypoxia for 2.5 h, whereas in vitro model employed primary cortical neurons of neonatal rats subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation for 2.5 h. Hesperidin pretreatment significantly reduced HI-induced brain tissue loss and improved neurological outcomes as shown in 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride monohydrate staining and foot-fault results. The neuroprotective effects of hesperidin are likely the results of preventing an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxide levels. Hesperidin treatment also activated a key survival signaling kinase, Akt, and suppressed the P-FoxO3 level. Hesperidin pretreatment protected neonatal HIE by reducing free radicals and activating phosphorylated Akt.

AB  - Abstract
Here we investigated whether changes in neurogenesis and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression are possible mechanisms involved in the depression-like symptom during the withdrawal/abstinence period after chronic binge-pattern alcohol consumption given the limited number of studies addressing the link between these factors in the adolescent brain. Forty-seven male Sprague–Dawley rats were used in the study and the experimental protocol started when rats were 25-days old. Rats were assigned to either: (a) ethanol or (b) control group. Animals in each group were further randomized to receive either: BDNF receptor agonist or vehicle. Rats were trained to self-administer ethanol and the binge protocol consisted of daily 30-min experimental sessions 4 h into the dark period for 12 days. Two days after the last drinking session, rats were tested in the sucrose preference test to evaluate anhedonia and the open field test after habituation to evaluate behavioral despair. Our data showed that: (1) self-administration of alcohol in a binge-like pattern causes inebriation as defined by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and this pattern of alcohol exposure is associated with the development of a depression-like symptom; (2) no significant difference in blood alcohol levels between the two ethanol groups; and (3) chronic binge drinking resulted in the development of a depressive phenotype, decreased survival and neuronal differentiation of neural progenitor cells in the hippocampus, and decreased BDNF effect during the withdrawal period. But the most important finding in our study is that augmenting BDNF actions through the use of tyrosine kinase B (TrkB, a BDNF receptor) agonist restored neurogenesis and abolished the alcohol-induced anhedonia and despair behaviors seen during the withdrawal/abstinence period. Our results suggest that BDNF might be a molecule that can be targeted for interventions in alcoholism–depression co-incidence.

AB  - Abstract
Forebrain neuronal circuits containing hypocretin-1 (hcrt-1) and norepinephrine (NE) are important components of central arousal-related processes. Recently, these two systems have been shown to have an overlapping distribution within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), a limbic structure activated by stressful challenges, and which functions to adjust arterial pressure (AP) and heart rate (HR) to the stressor. However, whether hcrt-1 and NE interact in BST to alter cardiovascular function is unknown. Experiments were done in urethane-α-chloralose anesthetized, paralyzed, and artificially ventilated male Wistar rats to investigate the effect of hcrt-1 and NE on the cardiovascular responses elicited by l-glutamate (Glu) stimulation of BST neurons. Microinjections of hcrt-1, NE or tyramine into BST attenuated the decrease in AP and HR to Glu stimulation of BST. Additionally, combined injections of hcrt-1 with NE or tyramine did not elicit a greater attenuation than either compound alone. Furthermore, injections into BST of the α2-adrenergic receptor (α2-AR) antagonist yohimbine, but not the α1-AR antagonist 2-{[β-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]aminomethyl}-1-tetralone hydrochloride, blocked both the hcrt-1 and NE-induced inhibition of the BST cardiovascular depressors responses. Finally, injections into BST of the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline, but not the GABAB receptor antagonist phaclofen, blocked the hcrt-1 and NE attenuation of the BST Glu-induced depressor and bradycardia responses. These data suggest that hcrt-1 effects in BST are mediated by NE neurons, and hcrt-1 likely acts to facilitate the synaptic release of NE. NE neurons, acting through α2-AR may activate Gabaergic neurons in BST, which in turn through the activation of GABAA receptors inhibit a BST sympathoinhibitory pathway. Taken together, these data suggest that hcrt-1 pathways to BST through their interaction with NE and Gabaergic neurons may function in the coordination of cardiovascular responses associated with different behavioral states.

AB  - Abstract
Paclitaxel (taxol) is a first-line chemotherapy-drug used to treat many types of cancers. Neuropathic pain and sensory dysfunction are the major toxicities, which are dose-limiting and significantly reduce the quality of life in patients. Two known critical spinal mechanisms underlying taxol-induced neuropathic pain are an increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and suppressed glial glutamate transporter activities. In this study, we uncovered that increased activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3β) in the spinal dorsal horn was concurrently associated with increased protein expressions of GFAP, IL-1β and a decreased protein expression of glial glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1), as well as the development and maintenance of taxol-induced neuropathic pain. The enhanced GSK3β activities were supported by the concurrently decreased AKT and mTOR activities. The changes of all these biomarkers were basically prevented when animals received pre-emptive lithium (a GSK3β inhibitor) treatment, which also prevented the development of taxol-induced neuropathic pain. Further, chronic lithium treatment, which began on day 11 after the first taxol injection, reversed the existing mechanical and thermal allodynia induced by taxol. The taxol-induced increased GSK3β activities and decreased AKT and mTOR activities in the spinal dorsal horn were also reversed by lithium. Meanwhile, protein expressions of GLT-1, GFAP and IL-1β in the spinal dorsal horn were improved. Hence, suppression of spinal GSK3β activities is a key mechanism used by lithium to reduce taxol-induced neuropathic pain, and targeting spinal GSK3β is an effective approach to ameliorate GLT-1 expression and suppress the activation of astrocytes and IL-1β over-production in the spinal dorsal horn.

AB  - Abstract
During early brain development, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are involved in cell migration, neuritogenesis, axon guidance and synapse formation, but the mechanisms which regulate NMDA receptor density and function remain unclear. The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism includes an agonist (quinolinic acid) and an antagonist (kynurenic acid) at NMDA receptors and we have previously shown that inhibition of the pathway using the kynurenine-3-monoxygenase inhibitor Ro61-8048 in late gestation produces rapid changes in protein expression in the embryos and effects on synaptic transmission lasting until postnatal day 21 (P21). The present study sought to determine whether any of these effects are maintained into adulthood. After prenatal injections of Ro61-8048 the litter was allowed to develop to P60 when some offspring were euthanized and the brains removed for examination. Analysis of protein expression by Western blotting revealed significantly reduced expression of the GluN2A subunit (32%) and the morphogenetic protein sonic hedgehog (31%), with a 29% increase in the expression of doublecortin, a protein associated with neurogenesis. No changes were seen in mRNA abundance using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Neuronal excitability was normal in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices but paired-pulse stimulation revealed less inhibition at short interpulse intervals. The amount of long-term potentiation was decreased by 49% in treated pups and recovery after low-frequency stimulation was delayed. The results not only strengthen the view that basal, constitutive kynurenine metabolism is involved in normal brain development, but also show that changes induced prenatally can affect the brains of adult offspring and those changes are quite different from those seen previously at weaning (P21). Those changes may be mediated by altered expression of NMDAR subunits and sonic hedgehog.

AB  - Abstract
In the first week of postnatal life of all examined mammalian species, there is a wave of apoptosis in the cerebral cortex, accounting for a loss of up to 30% of neuronal content from birth to adulthood. In this review we examine recent advances in the understanding of this curious phenomenon. We survey the phenomenological literature and elaborate a putative relationship between the formation of active neuronal networks and selective apoptosis of non-participatory neurons. The underlying reason for this apoptotic wave remains unclear, but molecular mechanisms are starting to be elucidated that account for its mechanism, including a role for insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1) and the Rho GTPases RhoA and RhoB. In addition, we discuss pathophysiological situations in which a variety of common drugs used either recreationally or for medical purposes, or pharmacological blockade of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) function, can also cause massive levels of apoptosis in this same developmental window. Experimentation linking molecular causes of developmental and pathophysiological apoptosis in postnatal cerebral cortex is discussed.

AB  - Abstract
Lateral lemniscus, a relay nucleus of auditory sensation, is involved in the control of phonatory movements such as human speech and vocalization of animals. The present study was designed to test whether neurons in the lateral lemniscus contributed to the control of swallowing, one of non-phonic oro-pharyngolaryngeal movements. In acutely decerebrated cats (n = 15), swallowing was induced by electrical stimulation (20–80 μA at 10 Hz for 20 s with rectangular pulses of 0.2 ms duration) delivered to the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN). Repetitive electrical stimulation (30–50 μA at 50 Hz for 10–20 s) applied to the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (LLD) increased the number and reduced the latency to the onset of the SLN-induced swallowing. On the other hand, stimulation of the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus and the paralemniscal area, corresponding to the ventrolateral part of the parabrachial nucleus and the Kölliker–Fuse nucleus, often suppressed the SLN-induced swallowing. Microinjection of NMDA (0.1–0.15 μl, 5.0–10 mM) into the LLD through a stereotaxically placed glass micropipette facilitated the SLN-induced swallowing, i.e., the number was increased and the latency of swallowing was reduced. We also injected muscimol (a gamma amino-butyric acid (GABA)A receptor agonist), bicuculline (a GABAA receptor antagonist) and baclofen (a GABAB receptor agonist) into the LLD (0.1–0.15 μl and 5.0 mM for each substance). It was observed that an injection of muscimol suppressed the SLN-induced swallowing. However, an injection of bicuculline facilitated the swallowing. An injection of baclofen did not alter the swallowing. These results suggest the presence of functional topography in the lateral lemniscus and the paralemniscal area in relation to the control of swallowing. The facilitatory LLD-effects on swallowing are modulated by glutamatergic and GABAergic receptors on neurons in the LLD.

AB  - Abstract
Electrophysiological properties of lumbar α-motoneurons change after chronic increases and decreases in hindlimb neuromuscular activity. Although modeling of these changes suggests that motoneurons probably alter gene expression in these situations, there is no evidence that this is the case. In this study, we measured the content of several mRNAs in lumbar motoneurons, harvested using laser capture microdissection, from rats previously subjected to normal cage activity, voluntary wheel exercise for 16 weeks, and forced treadmill training for 7 days and 16 weeks. As a result of the prolonged daily treadmill training, but not the voluntary wheel training, significant increases occurred in muscle peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α) mRNA, and in muscle PGC-1α and cytochrome oxidase proteins, in soleus and plantaris muscles. Significant changes in mRNA contents (decreases) were evident for the receptors 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) receptor 1A (5HT1a), GABA A receptor, subunit alpha 2 (GABAAα2), and for the potassium conductance calcium-activated channel protein (SK2) in the motoneurons from 16-week-trained rats, and for glutamate receptor, metabotropic 1 (mGluR1) in the voluntary wheel-trained rats. Motoneurons from 16-week treadmill-trained rats also did not demonstrate the decreases in several mRNAs that were evident after 7 days of treadmill exercise, suggesting an adaptation of motoneurons to acute stress. The mRNA changes following prolonged daily treadmill training are consistent with a reduction in inhibitory influences onto motoneurons, and a transition toward motoneurons that innervate slower contracting muscle fibers. These results demonstrate that the previously reported physiological changes in motoneurons with altered activity are accompanied by changes in gene expression.

AB  - Abstract
Individuals have different levels of stress sensitivity. An individual’s predisposition to experience negative life events (NLEs) may make him/her more vulnerable to a series of psychopathological and physical diseases. However, the neuroanatomical correlates of individual differences in sensitivity to NLEs remain unknown. In this study, voxel-based morphometry was used to identify the gray matter (GM) associations of individual differences in sensitivity to NLEs measured by adolescent self-rating life events checklist. Results showed that there was a positive association between individual NLEs sensitivity and regional GM volume (rGMV) in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). GM was mostly evident in the left frontal operculum and a small part of the left middle frontal gyrus. This region was thought to play an important role in introception. Importantly, our study revealed that rumination served as a mediator between the rGMV of the VLPFC and individual NLEs sensitivity. These findings suggest that people with greater VLPFC might be more inclined to ruminate and the ruminative response style might make them more sensitive to NLEs.

AB  - Abstract
Neuronal circuitries in the hippocampus are involved in navigation and memory and are controlled by major networks of GABAergic interneurons. Parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) are identified as fast-spiking cells, playing a crucial role in network oscillation and synchrony. The inhibitory modulation of these interneurons is thought to be mediated mainly through GABAA receptors, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. Here we show that all PV-positive interneurons in the granular/subgranular layer (GL/SGL) of the mouse DG express high levels of the GABAA receptor δ subunit. PV-containing interneurons in the hilus and the molecular layer, however, express the δ subunit to a lower extent. Only 8% of the somatostatin-containing interneurons express the δ subunit, whereas calbindin- or calretinin-containing interneurons in the DG seem not to express the GABAA receptor δ subunit at all. Hence, these cells receive a GABAergic control different from that of PV-containing interneurons in the GL/SGL. Experiments investigating a possible co-expression of GABAA receptor α1, α2, α3, α4, α5, β1, β2, β3, or γ2 subunits with PV and δ subunits indicated that α1 and β2 subunits are co-expressed with δ subunits along the extrasynaptic membranes of PV-interneurons. These results suggest a robust tonic GABAergic control of PV-containing interneurons in the GL/SGL of the DG via δ subunit-containing receptors. Our data are important for better understanding of the neuronal circuitries in the DG and the role of specific cell types under pathological conditions.

AB  - Abstract
The maintenance of neural circuit stability is a dynamic process that requires the plasticity of many cellular and synaptic components. By changing the excitatory/inhibitory balance, inhibitory GABAergic plasticity can regulate excitability, and contribute to neural circuit function and refinement in learning and memory. Increased inhibitory GABAergic neurotransmission has been shown in brain structures involved in the learning process. Previously, we showed that classical conditioning in which tactile stimulation of one row of vibrissae (conditioned stimulus, CS) was paired with a tail shock (unconditioned stimulus, UCS) in adult mice results in the increased density of GABAergic interneurons and increased expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)-67 in barrels of the “trained” row cortical representation. In inhibitory neurons of the rat cortex GAD co-localizes with several proteins and peptides. We found previously that the density of the parvalbumin (GAD+/Prv+)-containing subpopulation is not changed after conditioning. In the present study, we examined GABAergic somatostatin (Som)-, calbindin (CB)- and calretinin (CR)-positive interneurons in the cortical representation of “trained” vibrissae after training. Cells showing double immunostaining for GAD/Som, GAD/CR and GAD/CB were counted in the barrels representing vibrissae activated during the training and in control, untouched rows. We found a substantial increase of GAD/Som-containing cells in the trained row representation. No changes in the density of GAD/CR or GAD/CB neurons were observed. These results suggest that Som-containing interneurons are involved in learning-induced changes in the inhibitory cortical network.

AB  - Abstract
Cholinergic interneurons, which provide the main source of acetylcholine (ACh) in the striatum, control the striatal local circuits and deeply involve in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a crucial kinase with diverse fundamental functions and accepted that deregulation of GSK-3 activity also plays important roles in diverse neurodegenerative diseases. However, up to now, there is no direct proof indicating whether GSK-3 activation is responsible for cholinergic dysfunction. In the present study, with combined intracerebroventricular injection of Wortmannin and GF-109203X, we activated GSK-3 and demonstrated the increased phosphorylation level of microtubule-associated protein tau and neurofilaments (NFs) in the rat striatum. The activated GSK-3 consequently decreased ACh level in the striatum as a result of the reduction of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity. The alteration of ChAT activity was due to impaired ChAT distribution rather than its expression. Furthermore, we proved that cellular ChAT distribution was dependent on low phosphorylation level of NFs. Nevertheless, the cholinergic dysfunction in the striatum failed to induce significant neuronal number reduction. In summary, our data demonstrates the link between GSK-3 activation and cholinergic dysfunction in the striatum and provided beneficial evidence for the pathogenesis study of relevant neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Abstract
Müller cells are not only the main glial cell type in the retina but also latent progenitor/stem cells, which in pathological conditions can transdifferentiate to a neuronal phenotype and regenerate the neurons lost in a mature retina. Several signal transduction pathways can induce the dedifferentiation of mature Müller cells to a progenitor-like state, including that stimulated by glutamate. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which terminally differentiated cells are initially primed to acquire multipotency remain unclear. In the present study, we have characterized early genetic and epigenetic events that occur immediately after glutamate-induced dedifferentiation of fully differentiated Müller cells is initiated. Using Müller cell-enriched cultures from postnatal rats, we demonstrate that glutamate triggers a rapid dedifferentiation response characterized by changes in cell morphology coupled to the induction of progenitor cell marker gene expression (e.g., nestin, lin28 and sox2) within 1 h. Dedifferentiation involved the activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate and type II metabotropic glutamate receptors, as well as global DNA demethylation (evident through the decrease in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 immunoreactivity) and an increase in gadd45-β gene expression; although, early progenitor gene expression was only partially inhibited by pharmacological impairment of DNA methylation. Importantly, the expression of Müller glia identity genes (i.e., glutamine synthetase; cellular retinaldehyde binding protein, CRALBP) is retained through the process. Dedifferentiated Müller cells held an early neuronal differentiation potential similar to that observed in retinal progenitor-enriched cultures but, contrary to the latter, dedifferentiated Müller cells failed to further differentiate into mature photoreceptor lineages. We speculate that, in spite of the initial triggering of the dedifferentiation pathways, these cells may exhibit a certain degree of epigenetic memory that precludes them from further differentiation.

AB  - Abstract
Aged ovariectomized (OVX) female monkeys, a model for menopause in humans, show a decline in spine density in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and diminished performance in cognitive tasks requiring this brain region. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that long-term cyclic treatment with 17β-estradiol (E) produces an increase in spine density and in the proportion of thinner spines in layer III pyramidal neurons in the dlPFC of both young and aged OVX rhesus monkeys. Here we used 3D reconstruction of Lucifer yellow-loaded neurons to investigate whether clinically relevant schedules of hormone therapy would produce similar changes in prefrontal cortical neuronal morphology as long-term cyclic E treatment in young female monkeys. We found that continuously delivered E, with or without a cyclic progesterone treatment, did not alter spine density or morphology in the dlPFC of young adult OVX rhesus monkeys. We also found that the increased density of thinner spines evident in the dlPFC 24 h after E administration in the context of long-term cyclic E therapy is no longer detectable 20 days after E treatment. When compared with the results of our previously published investigations, our results suggest that cyclic fluctuations in serum E levels may cause corresponding fluctuations in the density of thin spines in the dlPFC. By contrast, continuous administration of E does not support sustained increases in thin spine density. Physiological fluctuations in E concentration may be necessary to maintain the morphological sensitivity of the dlPFC to E.

The purpose of this study was to examine the dose–response effectiveness of d-methionine (d-met) in rescuing a noise-induced permanent threshold shift (PTS) and cochlear biochemistry following noise exposure. One hour after being exposed to continuous broadband white noise at 105 dB sound pressure level (SPL) for 6 h, guinea-pigs were treated five times at 12-h intervals with 200, 400, or 600 mg/kg d-met or sterile 0.9% saline (each group, N = 6) by intraperitoneal injection. Six guinea-pigs with normal hearing that were not exposed to noise served as control animals. Although administration of d-met 200 mg/kg did not significantly reduce the mean PTS, treatment with d-met 600 mg/kg achieved a complete rescue response. The level of rescue from noise-induced PTS following treatment with 200, 400, or 600 mg/kg d-met was dose dependent. The attenuation of the noise-induced decreases in the activities of the Na+, K+-ATPase and Ca2+-ATPase following treatment with 200, 400, or 600 mg/kg d-met was also dose dependent. Likewise, d-met-dose-dependent decreases in mean lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide levels were observed in the d-met treated groups. Significant attenuation of increased oxidative stress and decreased ATPase activities was concurrent with the d-met-mediated improvements in noise-induced auditory dysfunction.

In the present study, we addressed the question of whether the distinct patterns of heat shock protein (HSP) 70 and HSP90 expressions in the brain region represents the regional specific responses to status epilepsticus (SE) in an effort to better understand the role of HSPs in epileptogenic insult. HSP70 immunoreactivity was increased in CA3 pyramidal cells as well as dentate granule cells at 12 h–1 week after SE. HSP70 immunoreactivity was transiently increased in neurons within the piriform cortex (PC) following SE. Linear regression analysis showed no correlation between the intensity of NeuN and that of HSP70. In contrast to HSP70, HSP90 immunoreactivity was decreased in CA1–3 pyramidal cells at 4 days–4 weeks after SE. In addition, HSP90 immunoreactivity was decreased in PC neurons at 12 h–4 weeks after SE. linear regression analysis showed a direct proportional relationship between the intensity of NeuN and that of HSP90. Therefore, these findings suggest that HSP90 degradation may be closely related to neuronal vulnerability to SE insult.

AB  - Abstract
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is critically involved in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission. Our lab has previously found that BDNF activation of neurotrophic tyrosine kinase, receptor, type 2 (TrkB) is required for fear memory formation and that GABAA receptor (GABAAR) subunits and the GABAA clustering protein gephyrin are dynamically regulated during fear memory consolidation. We hypothesize that TrkB-dependent internalization of GABAARs may partially underlie a transient period of amygdala hyperactivation during fear memory consolidation. We have previously reported that BDNF modulates GABAAR α1 subunit sequestration in cultured hippocampal and amygdala neurons by differential phosphorylation pathways. At present, no studies have investigated the regulation of gephyrin and GABAAR α1 subunits following BDNF activation in the amygdala. In this study, we confirm the association of GABAAR α1 and γ2 subunits with gephyrin on mouse amygdala neurons by coimmunoprecipitation and immunocytochemistry. We then demonstrate that rapid BDNF treatment, as well as suppression of gephyrin protein levels on amygdala neurons, induced sequestration of surface α1 subunits. Further, we find that rapid exposure of BDNF to primary amygdala cultures produced decreases in gephyrin levels, whereas longer exposure resulted in an eventual increase. While total α1 subunit levels remained unchanged, gephyrin was downregulated in whole cell homogenates, but enhanced in complexes with GABAARs. Our data with anisomycin suggest that BDNF may rapidly induce gephyrin protein degradation, with subsequent gephyrin synthesis occurring. Together, these findings suggest that gephyrin may be a key factor in BDNF-dependent GABAAR regulation in the amygdala. This work may inform future studies aimed at elucidating the pathways connecting BDNF, GABAA systems, gephyrin, and their role in underlying amygdala-dependent learning.

AB  - Stressful life events, especially those that induce fear, can produce a state of anxiety that is useful for avoiding similar fearful and potentially dangerous situations in the future. However, they can also lead to exaggerated states, which over time can produce mental illness. These changing states of readiness versus illness are thought to be regulated, at least in part, by alterations in dendritic and synaptic structure within brain regions known to be involved in anxiety. These regions include the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex. In this article, we review the reciprocal relationships between the expression of stress- and anxiety-related behaviors and stress-induced morphological plasticity as detected by changes in dendrites and spines in these three brain regions. We begin by highlighting the acute and chronic effects of stress on synaptic morphology in each area and describe some of the putative mechanisms that have been implicated in these effects. We then discuss the functional consequences of stress-induced structural plasticity focusing on synaptic plasticity as well as cognitive and emotional behaviors. Finally, we consider how these structural changes may contribute to adaptive behaviors as well as maladaptive responses associated with anxiety.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder whose clinical features include impairments in perception, cognition and motivation. These impairments reflect alterations in neuronal circuitry within and across multiple brain regions that are due, at least in part, to deficits in dendritic spines, the site of most excitatory synaptic connections. Dendritic spine alterations have been identified in multiple brain regions in schizophrenia, but are best characterized in layer 3 of the neocortex, where pyramidal cell spine density is lower. These spine deficits appear to arise during development, and thus are likely the result of disturbances in the molecular mechanisms that underlie spine formation, pruning, and/or maintenance. Each of these mechanisms may provide insight into novel therapeutic targets for preventing or repairing the alterations in neural circuitry that mediate the debilitating symptoms of schizophrenia.

AB  - Abstract
Neuronal differentiation, pathfinding and morphology are directed by biochemical cues that in vivo are presented in a complex scaffold of extracellular matrix. This microenvironment is three-dimensional (3D) and heterogeneous. Therefore, it is not surprising that more physiologically-relevant cellular responses are found in 3D culture environments rather than on two-dimensional (2D) flat substrates. One key difference between 2D and 3D environments is the spatial arrangement of cell–matrix interactions. Integrins and other receptor proteins link the various molecules presented in the extracellular environment to intracellular signaling cascades and thus influence a number of neuronal responses including the availability and activation of integrins themselves. We have previously reported that a 3D substrate induces an important morphological transformation of embryonic mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Here, we investigate the hypothesis that β1-integrin signaling via focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the RhoGTPases Rac and Rho influences neuronal morphology in 2D vs 3D environments. We report that β1-integrin activity and FAK phosphorylation at tyrosine 397 (FAKpY397) are linked to neuronal polarization as well as neurite outgrowth and branching. Rac and Rho expression are decreased in 3D vs 2D culture but not correlated with β1-integrin function. These results suggest that proper β1-integrin activity is required for the elaboration of physiologic DRG morphology and that 3D culture provides a more appropriate milieu to the mimic in vivo scenario. We propose that neuronal morphology may be directed during development and regeneration by factors that influence how β1-integrin, FAK and RhoGTPase molecules integrate substrate signals in the 3D microenvironment.

AB  - Abstract
Pain encompasses both a sensory as well as an affective dimension and these are differentially processed in the cortex. Animal models typically use reflexive behaviors to test nociceptive responses; these are thought to reflect the sensory dimension of pain. While several behavioral tests are available for examining the affective dimension of pain it is unclear if these are appropriate in animal models of muscle pain. We therefore tested the utility of existing paradigms as well as new avoidance paradigms in animal models of muscle pain in mice. Specifically we used an escape-avoidance test to noxious mechanical stimuli, a learned avoidance test to noxious mechanical stimuli, and avoidance of physical activity. We used three animal models of muscle pain: carrageenan-induced inflammation, non-inflammatory muscle pain, and exercise-enhanced pain. In the carrageenan model of inflammation mice developed escape-avoidance behaviors to mechanical stimuli, learned avoidance to mechanical stimulation and avoidance of physical activity – these models are associated with unilateral hyperalgesia. When both muscles were inflamed, escape-avoidance behaviors did not develop suggesting that equivalent bilateral pain behaviors cannot be tested with an escape-avoidance test. In the non-inflammatory muscle pain model mice did not show significant changes in escape-avoidance behaviors or learned avoidance, but did avoid physical activity. In the exercise-enhanced pain model, there were no changes in escape-avoidance, learned avoidance of noxious or physical activity In conclusion, we developed several testing protocols that assess supraspinal processing of pain behaviors in models of muscle pain and that are most sensitive in animals with unilateral hyperalgesia.

AB  - Abstract
Individuals are exposed to stressful events in their daily life. The effects of stress on brain function ranges from highly adaptive to increasing the risk to develop psychopathology. For example, stressful experiences are remembered well which can be seen as a highly appropriate behavioral adaptation. On the other hand, stress is an important risk factor, in susceptible individuals, for depression and anxiety. An important question that remains to be addressed is how stress regulates brain function and what determines the threshold between adaptive and maladaptive responses. Excitatory synapses play a crucial role in synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity and behavioral adaptation. In this review we discuss how brief and prolonged exposure to stress, in adulthood and early life, regulate the function of these synapses, and how these effects may contribute to behavioral adaptation and psychopathology.

AB  - Abstract
Using specific riboprobes, we characterized the expression of vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT)1–VGLUT3 transcripts in lumbar 4–5 (L4–5) dorsal root ganglions (DRGs) and the thoracolumbar to lumbosacral spinal cord in male BALB/c mice after a 1- or 3-day hindpaw inflammation, or a 7-day sciatic nerve axotomy. Sham animals were also included. In sham and contralateral L4–5 DRGs of injured mice, VGLUT1-, VGLUT2- and VGLUT3 mRNAs were expressed in ∼45%, ∼69% or ∼17% of neuron profiles (NPs), respectively. VGLUT1 was expressed in large and medium-sized NPs, VGLUT2 in NPs of all sizes, and VGLUT3 in small and medium-sized NPs. In the spinal cord, VGLUT1 was restricted to a number of NPs at thoracolumbar and lumbar segments, in what appears to be the dorsal nucleus of Clarke, and in mid laminae III–IV. In contrast, VGLUT2 was present in numerous NPs at all analyzed spinal segments, except the lateral aspects of the ventral horns, especially at the lumbar enlargement, where it was virtually absent. VGLUT3 was detected in a discrete number of NPs in laminae III–IV of the dorsal horn. Axotomy resulted in a moderate decrease in the number of DRG NPs expressing VGLUT3, whereas VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 were unaffected. Likewise, the percentage of NPs expressing VGLUT transcripts remained unaltered after hindpaw inflammation, both in DRGs and the spinal cord. Altogether, these results confirm previous descriptions on VGLUTs expression in adult mice DRGs, with the exception of VGLUT1, whose protein expression was detected in a lower percentage of mouse DRG NPs. A detailed account on the location of neurons expressing VGLUTs transcripts in the adult mouse spinal cord is also presented. Finally, the lack of change in the number of neurons expressing VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 transcripts after axotomy, as compared to data on protein expression, suggests translational rather than transcriptional regulation of VGLUTs after injury.

AB  - Abstract
The velocity of impact between an object and the human head is a critical factor influencing brain injury outcomes but has not been explored in any detail in animal models. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of the interplay between impact velocity and injury severity in a well-established weight-drop impact acceleration (WDIA) model of diffuse brain injury in rodents. We modified the standard WDIA model to produce impact velocities of 5.4, 5.85 and 6.15 m/s while keeping constant the weight and the drop height. Gradations in impact velocity produced progressive degrees of injury severity measured behaviourally, electrophysiologically and anatomically, with the former two methods showing greater sensitivity to changes in impact velocity. There were impact velocity-dependent reductions in sensorimotor performance and in cortical depth-related depression of sensory cortex responses; however axonal injury (demonstrated by immunohistochemistry for β-amyloid precursor protein and neurofilament heavy-chain) was discernible only at the highest impact velocity. We conclude that the WDIA model is capable of producing graded axonal injury in a repeatable manner, and as such will prove useful in the study of the biomechanics, pathophysiology and potential treatment of diffuse axonal injury.

AB  - Abstract
Progranulin (PGRN) is known to play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, it has been demonstrated that patients with the homozygous mutation in the GRN gene present with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, and there is growing evidence that PGRN is related to lysosomal function. In the present study, we investigated the possible role of PGRN in the lysosomes of activated microglia in the cerebral cortex after traumatic brain injury (TBI). We showed that the mouse GRN gene has two possible coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation (CLEAR) sequences that bind to transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal genes. PGRN was colocalized with Lamp1, a lysosomal marker, and Lamp1-positive areas in GRN-deficient (KO) mice were significantly expanded compared with wild-type (WT) mice after TBI. Expression of all the lysosome-related genes examined in KO mice was significantly higher than that in WT mice. The number of activated microglia with TFEB localized to the nucleus was also significantly increased in KO as compared with WT mice. Since the TFEB translocation is regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity in the lysosome, we compared ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) phosphorylation that reflects mTORC1 activity. S6K1 phosphorylation in KO mice was significantly lower than that in WT mice. In addition, the number of nissl-positive and fluoro-jade B-positive cells around the injury was significantly decreased and increased, respectively, in KO as compared with WT mice. These results suggest that PGRN localized in the lysosome is involved in the activation of mTORC1, and its deficiency leads to increased TFEB nuclear translocation with a resultant increase in lysosomal biogenesis in activated microglia and exacerbated neuronal damage in the cerebral cortex after TBI.

AB  - Abstract
Neurotrophic factors delivered from target muscles are essential for motoneuronal survival, mainly during development and early postnatal maturation. It has been shown that the disconnection between motoneurons and their innervated muscle by means of axotomy produces a vast neuronal death in neonatal animals. In the present work, we have evaluated the effects of different neurotrophic factors on motoneuronal survival after neonatal axotomy, using as a model the motoneurons innervating the extraocular eye muscles. With this purpose, neonatal rats were monocularly enucleated at the day of birth (postnatal day 0) and different neurotrophic treatments (NGF, BDNF, NT-3, GDNF and the mixture of BDNF + GDNF) were applied intraorbitally by means of a Gelfoam implant (a single dose of 5 μg of each factor). We first demonstrated that extraocular eye muscles of neonatal rats expressed these neurotrophic factors and therefore constituted a natural source of retrograde delivery for their innervating motoneurons. By histological and immunocytochemical methods we determined that all treatments significantly rescued extraocular motoneurons from axotomy-induced cell death. For the dose used, NGF and GDNF were the most potent survival factors for these motoneurons, followed by BDNF and lastly by NT-3. The simultaneous administration of BDNF and GDNF did not increase the survival-promoting effects above those obtained by GDNF alone. Interestingly, the rescue effects of all neurotrophic treatments persisted even 30 days after lesion. The administration of these neurotrophic factors, with the exception of NT-3, also prevented the loss of the cholinergic phenotype observed by 10 days after axotomy. At the dosage applied, NGF and GDNF were revealed again as the most effective neuroprotective agents against the axotomy-induced decrease in ChAT. Two remarkable findings highlighted in the present work that contrasted with other motoneuronal types after neonatal axotomy: first, the extremely high efficacy of NGF as a neuroprotective agent and, second, the long-lasting effects of neurotrophic administration on cell survival and ChAT expression in extraocular motoneurons.

To examine the effect of glucose on the cerebral metabolism of glutamine, rat brain slices were incubated with 5 mM [3-13C]glutamine without and with 5 mM unlabeled glucose. Tissue plus medium extracts were analyzed by using enzymatic and 13C NMR techniques and fluxes through the enzymatic steps involved were calculated with a mathematical model. We demonstrate that glucose increased alanine, pyruvate and glutamate accumulations and decreased ammonium ions accumulation, aspartate accumulation and labeling, and GABA labeling. In order to determine the participation of glutamine synthetase when glucose was added to the incubation medium, we incubated rat brain slices with 5 mM [3-13C]glutamine plus 5 mM unlabeled glucose without and with 2 mM methionine sulfoximine (MSO). The results indicate that 77% of the newly appeared glutamine was formed via glutamine synthetase and 23% from endogenous sources; the stimulation of [3-13C]glutamine removal by MSO also strongly suggests the existence of a cycle between [3-13C]glutamine and [3-13C]glutamate. This work also demonstrates that glucose increased fluxes through hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, pyruvate carboxylase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, flux from α-ketoglutarate to glutamate and flux through glutamine synthetase whereas it inhibited fluxes through aspartate aminotransferase, glutamic acid decarboxylase and GABA aminotransferase.

An increasing number of studies indicate that there exists greater diversity of cortical neurons than previously appreciated. In the present report, we use a combination of physiological and morphological methods to characterize cortical neurons in infragranular layers with apical dendrites pointing toward the white-matter compared to those neurons with apical dendrites pointing toward the pia in both mouse and rat neocortex. Several features of the dendritic morphology and intrinsic and synaptic physiology of these “inverted” neurons revealed numerous differences among this cell type between species. We also found differences between the different cell types within the same species. These data reveal that similar cell types in the rat and mouse may not always share similar physiological and morphological properties. These data are relevant to models of information processing through micro- and larger neocortical circuits and indicate that different cell types found within similar lamina can have different functional properties.

AB  - Abstract
D2 receptor null mutant (Drd2−/−) mice have altered responses to the rewarding and locomotor effects of psychostimulant drugs, which is evidence of a necessary role for D2 receptors in these behaviors. Furthermore, work with mice that constitutively express only the D2 receptor short form (D2S), as a result of genetic deletion of the long form (D2L), provides the basis for a current model in which D2L is thought to be the postsynaptic D2 receptor on medium spiny neurons in the basal forebrain, and D2S the autoreceptor that regulates the activity of dopamine neurons and dopamine synthesis and release. Because constitutive genetic deletion of the D2 or D2L receptor may cause compensatory changes that influence functional outcomes, our approach is to identify aspects of the abnormal phenotype of a Drd2−/− mouse that can be normalized by virus-mediated D2 receptor expression. Drd2−/− mice are deficient in basal and methamphetamine-induced locomotor activation and lack D2 receptor agonist-induced activation of G protein-regulated inward rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs) in dopaminergic neurons. Here we show that virus-mediated expression of D2L in the nucleus accumbens significantly restored methamphetamine-induced locomotor activation, but not basal locomotor activity, compared to mice receiving the control virus. It also restored the effect of methamphetamine to decrease time spent in the center of the activity chamber in female but not male Drd2−/− mice. Furthermore, the effect of expression of D2S was indistinguishable from D2L. Similarly, virus-mediated expression of either D2S or D2L in substantia nigra neurons restored D2 agonist-induced activation of GIRKs. In this acute expression system, the alternatively spliced forms of the D2 receptor appear to be equally capable of acting as postsynaptic receptors and autoreceptors.

AB  - Abstract
Non-invasive brain imaging requires comprehensive interpretation of hemodynamic signals. In functional magnetic resonance imaging, blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals are used to infer neural processes. This necessitates a clear understanding of how BOLD signals and neural activity are related. One fundamental question concerns the relative importance of synaptic activity and spiking discharge. Although these two components are related, most previous work shows that synaptic activity is better reflected in the BOLD signal. However, the mechanisms of this relationship are not clear. The BOLD signal depends on relative changes in cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen. Oxygen metabolism changes are difficult to measure with current imaging techniques, but it is possible to obtain direct quantitative simultaneous in vivo measurement of tissue oxygen and co-localized underlying neural activity. Here, we use this approach with a specific binocular stimulus protocol in order to activate inhibitory and excitatory neuronal pathways in the visual cortex. During excitatory binocular interaction, we find that metabolic, spiking, and local field potential responses are correlated. However, during suppressive binocular interaction, spiking activity and local field potentials (LFP) are dissociated while only the latter is coupled with metabolic response. These results suggest that inhibitory connections may be a key factor in the dissociation between LFP and spiking activity, which may contribute substantially to the close coupling between the BOLD signal and synchronized synaptic activity in the brain.

AB  - Abstract
The neuregulin 1 gene has repeatedly been identified as a susceptibility gene for schizophrenia, thus mice with genetic mutations in this gene offer a valuable tool for studying the role of neuregulin 1 in schizophrenia-related neurotransmission. In this study, slide-based receptor autoradiography was used to quantify glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), dopaminergic D2, cannabinoid CB1 and acetylcholine M1/4 receptor levels in the brains of male heterozygous transmembrane domain neuregulin 1 mutant (Nrg1+/−) mice at two ages. Mutant mice expressed small but significant increases in NMDA receptor levels in the cingulate cortex (7%, p = 0.044), sensory cortex (8%, p = 0.024), and motor cortex (8%, p = 0.047), effects that were independent of age. In the nucleus accumbens and thalamus Nrg1+/− mice exhibited age-dependent alterations in NMDA receptors. Nrg1+/− mice showed a statistically significant increase in NMDA receptor levels in the nucleus accumbens of 14-week-old Nrg1+/− mice compared to control littermates of the same age (12%, p = 0.026), an effect that was not seen in 20-week-old mice. In contrast, NMDA receptor levels in the thalamus, while initially unchanged in 14-week-old mice, were then decreased in the 20-week-old Nrg1+/− mice compared to control littermates of the same age (14%, p = 0.011). Nrg1+/− mutant mice expressed a significant reduction in D2 receptor levels (13–16%) in the striatum compared to controls, independent of age. While there was a borderline significant increase (6%, p = 0.058) in cannabinoid CB1 receptor levels in the substantia nigra of Nrg1+/− mice compared to controls, CB1 as well as acetylcholine M1/4 receptors showed no change in Nrg1+/− mice in any other brain region examined. These data indicate that a Nrg1 transmembrane mutation produces selective imbalances in glutamatergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission, which are two key systems believed to contribute to schizophrenia pathogenesis. While the effects on these systems are subtle, they may underlie the susceptibility of these mutants to further impacts.

AB  - Abstract
The role of inflammation in inducing visceral hypersensitivity (VHS) in ulcerative colitis patients remains unknown. We tested the hypothesis that acute ulcerative colitis-like inflammation does not induce VHS. However, it sets up molecular conditions such that chronic stress following inflammation exaggerates single-unit afferent discharges to colorectal distension. We used dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce ulcerative colitis-like inflammation and a 9-day heterotypic chronic stress protocol in rats. DSS upregulated Nav1.8 mRNA in colon-responsive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, TRPV1 in colonic muscularis externae (ME) and BDNF in spinal cord without affecting the spike frequency in spinal afferents or VMR to CRD. By contrast, chronic stress did not induce inflammation but it downregulated Kv1.1 and Kv1.4 mRNA in DRG neurons, and upregulated TRPA1 and nerve growth factor in ME, which mediated the increase of spike frequency and VMR to CRD. Chronic stress following inflammation exacerbated spike frequency in spinal afferent neurons. TRPA1 antagonist suppressed the sensitization of afferent neurons. DSS-inflammation did not affect the composition or excitation thresholds of low-threshold and high-threshold fibers. Chronic stress following inflammation increased the percent composition of high-threshold fibers and lowered the excitation threshold of both types of fibers. We conclude that not all types of inflammation induce VHS, whereas chronic stress induces VHS in the absence of inflammation.

AB  - Abstract
Cognitive dysfunction is relatively frequent in multiple sclerosis (MS) and it happens from the early stages of the disease. There is increasing evidence that the grey matter may be involved in autoimmune inflammation during relapses of MS. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if a single transfer of encephalitogenic T cells, mimicking a relapse of MS, may cause hippocampal damage and memory disturbances in rats. Lewis rats were injected with anti-MBP CD4+ T cells, that induced one-phase autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) with full recovery from motor impairments at 10–15 days. The spatial learning and memory were tested by the Morris water maze test in control and EAE animals, 30 and 90 days post-induction (dpi). The neural injury and inflammation was investigated in the hippocampus by immunohistochemistry and quantitative analyses. There was a marked decrease in the number of CA1 and CA4 pyramidal neurons 5 dpi. The loss of neurons then aggravated till the 90 dpi. An increase in microglial and astroglial activation and in pro-inflammatory cytokines mRNA expression in the hippocampus, were present 30 and 90 dpi. Nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA levels were also significantly elevated. The water maze test, however, did not reveal memory deficits. The present data indicate that a single transfer of autoimmune T cells results in preserved inflammation and probable on-going neuronal injury in the hippocampus, long after recovery from motor disturbances. These findings suggest that any relapse of the MS may start the neurodegenerative process in the hippocampus, which is not necessarily connected with memory deficits.

AB  - Abstract
The cortical area located in the lateral portion of the posteromedial suprasylvian sulcus (PMLS) is considered a key area for motion processing. It receives major projections from areas 17 and 18 but also from the lateral posterior-pulvinar complex where neurons exhibit, for the most part, complex receptive fields (RF). Based on these inputs, complex-like RFs would be expected for PMLS neurons and results from hand-plot mapping support this idea. However, PMLS neurons’ first-order spatiotemporal RF profiles and their role in shaping neuronal response characteristics is currently unknown. In this study, the first-order spatiotemporal characteristics of PMLS cells were revealed using reverse correlation analysis, based on responses elicited by coarse white noise stimuli. Experiments were carried out in adult anesthetized cats. Detailed RF profiles were obtained by analyzing bright and dark subfields separately. Results indicate that the average maximal spike probability is higher for dark subfields than for their paired bright subfields. Spatial RF analysis shows that neurons exhibit oval RF subfields and that their size is larger for dark subfields. The majority of cells have complex-like profiles, with spatially overlapping RF subfields. Temporal analysis showed that for the majority of cells, subfields are coincidentally activated; however, a subset of neurons exhibit time-dissociated subfield peak activity windows. Correlation analysis between spatial and temporal parameters of RF subfields and their neuron’s response characteristics to gratings was also performed. The data show that the direction index is positively correlated with subfield size difference and negatively correlated with spatial subfield overlap. Modulation index is negatively correlated with the degree of temporal subfield activity overlap. We conclude that first-order RF structures are important functional factors that shape PMLS neurons response characteristics.

AB  - Abstract
The maximum rate (Vmax) of some enzymatic activities related to energy consumption was evaluated in synaptic plasma membranes from rat brain striatum, the synaptic energy state being a crucial factor in neurodegenerative diseases etiopathogenesis. Two types of synaptic plasma membranes were isolated from rats subjected to in vivo treatment with l-acetylcarnitine at two different doses (30 and 60 mg × kg−1 i.p., 28 days, 5 days/week). The following enzyme activities were evaluated: acetylcholinesterase (AChE); Na+, K+, Mg2+-ATP-ase; ouabain insensitive Mg2+-ATP-ase; Na+, K+-ATP-ase; direct Mg2+-ATP-ase; Ca2+, Mg2+-ATP-ase; and low- and high-affinity Ca2+-ATP-ase. In control (vehicle-treated) animals, enzymatic activities are differently expressed in synaptic plasma membranes type I (SPM1) with respect to synaptic plasma membranes type II (SPM2), the evaluated enzymatic activities being higher in SPM2. Subchronic treatment with l-acetylcarnitine decreased AChE on SPM1 and SPM2 at the dose of 30 mg × kg−1. Pharmacological treatment decreased ouabain insensitive Mg2+-ATP-ase activity and high affinity Ca2+-ATP-ase activity at the doses of 30 and 60 mg × kg−1 respectively on SPM1, while it decreased Na+, K+-ATP-ase, direct Mg2+-ATP-ase and Ca2+, Mg2+-ATP-ase activities at the dose of 30 mg × kg−1 on SPM2. These results suggest that the sensitivity to drug treatment is different between these two populations of synaptic plasma membranes from the striatum, confirming the micro-heterogeneity of these subfractions, possessing different metabolic machinery with respect to energy consumption and utilization and the regional selective effect of l-acetylcarnitine on cerebral tissue, depending on the considered area. The drug potential effect at the synaptic level in Parkinson’s Disease neuroprotection is also discussed with respect to acetylcholine and energy metabolism.

AB  - Abstract
Status epilepticus (SE) triggers abnormal expression of genes in the hippocampus, such as glutamate receptor subunit epsilon-2 (Grin2b/Nr2b) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), that is thought to occur in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). We examined the underlying DNA methylation mechanisms and investigated whether these mechanisms contribute to the expression of these gene targets in the epileptic hippocampus. Experimental TLE was provoked by kainic acid-induced SE. Bisulfite sequencing analysis revealed increased Grin2b/Nr2b and decreased Bdnf DNA methylation levels that corresponded to decreased Grin2b/Nr2b and increased Bdnf mRNA and protein expression in the epileptic hippocampus. Blockade of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity with zebularine decreased global DNA methylation levels and reduced Grin2b/Nr2b, but not Bdnf, DNA methylation levels. Interestingly, we found that DNMT blockade further decreased Grin2b/Nr2b mRNA expression whereas GRIN2B protein expression increased in the epileptic hippocampus, suggesting that a posttranscriptional mechanism may be involved. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis we found that DNMT inhibition restored the decreases in AP2alpha transcription factor levels at the Grin2b/Nr2b promoter in the epileptic hippocampus. DNMT inhibition increased field excitatory postsynaptic potential in hippocampal slices isolated from epileptic rats. Electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring confirmed that DNMT inhibition did not significantly alter the disease course, but promoted the latency to seizure onset or SE. Thus, DNA methylation may be an early event triggered by SE that persists late into the epileptic hippocampus to contribute to gene expression changes in TLE.

AB  - Abstract
Nuclear factor (NF)-κB acetylation has been shown to participate in a number of neurological processes by regulating the expression of certain genes. We have previously demonstrated the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) expression and nitric oxide (NO) production may be regulated by NF-κB acetylation via an NF-κB responsive element within the nNOS promoter in neuronal cells. p300 is a ubiquitous transcription coactivator with intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, which is important in the nervous system. In the present study, we aimed at probing if p300 participated in regulating the nNOS expression through the NF-κB-mediated way. As a result, we found p300 enhanced the nNOS protein and mRNA levels in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells by enhancing the binding of NF-κB to the nNOS promoter and NF-κB-mediated nNOS transcription. Meanwhile, p300 was shown to directly acetylate NF-κB p65 and p50 subunits, interact with NF-κB and bind to the NF-κB responsive element region within the nNOS promoter. Taken together, our results indicate p300 acts as both an HAT and a coactivator in regulating NF-κB-mediated nNOS expression, which provide some correlations between p300 and nNOS in neuronal cell, and suggest that some p300-related neurological disorders may be partially based on its effect on the nNOS expression.

Early exposure to stressful life events plays a significant role in adolescent depression. Clinical studies have identified a number of factors that increase the risk of depression, including sex of the subject, duration of the stressor, and genetic polymorphisms that elevate serotonin levels. In this study we used the maternal separation (MS) model to investigate to what extent these factors interacted during development to manifest in depressive-like behavior in male and female rats. The triadic model of learned helplessness parses depressive-like behavior into aspects of controllable, uncontrollable, and motivational behaviors. This model was used to investigate how the timing of MS between the ages of postnatal day (P) 2–9 and P9–16 interacted with either simultaneous vehicle (saline; 1 ml/kg; i.p.) or fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) exposure, which was used to enhance serotonin levels; these experiments also compared the effect of a vehicle injection during these developmental periods to a no injection control. Vehicle injections alone increased helplessness in the controllable condition in male rats when injected between P9–16 only, and did not interact further with MS. MS at both ages decreased controllability in male adolescents; females demonstrated an increase in controllability after MS. Elevated serotonin at P2–9 increased escape latencies in male and female control and MS subjects. Fluoxetine exposure at P9–16 increased helplessness in controls. Fluoxetine decreased helplessness in MS males independent of age, but increases helplessness in MS females. This study highlights the importance of age of MS (MS between P2–9 increases helplessness in males more than females), the duration of the stressor (previous results show females are effected by longer MS [P2–20], but not shorter [this study]), and that elevated serotonin increases escape latencies to a greater extent in females.

AB  - Abstract
Phrenic long-term facilitation (pLTF) is a form of serotonin-dependent respiratory plasticity induced by acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH). pLTF requires spinal Gq protein-coupled serotonin-2 receptor (5-HT2) activation, new synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and activation of its high-affinity receptor, TrkB. Intrathecal injections of selective agonists for Gs protein-coupled receptors (adenosine 2A and serotonin-7; 5-HT7) also induce long-lasting phrenic motor facilitation via TrkB “trans-activation.” Since serotonin released near phrenic motor neurons may activate multiple serotonin receptor subtypes, we tested the hypothesis that 5-HT7 receptor activation contributes to AIH-induced pLTF. A selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonist (SB-269970, 5 mM, 12 μl) was administered intrathecally at C4 to anesthetized, vagotomized and ventilated rats prior to AIH (3, 5-min episodes, 11% O2). Contrary to predictions, pLTF was greater in SB-269970 treated versus control rats (80 ± 11% versus 45 ± 6% 60 min post-AIH; p &lt; 0.05). Hypoglossal LTF was unaffected by spinal 5-HT7 receptor inhibition, suggesting that drug effects were localized to the spinal cord. Since 5-HT7 receptors are coupled to protein kinase A (PKA), we tested the hypothesis that PKA inhibits AIH-induced pLTF. Similar to 5-HT7 receptor inhibition, spinal PKA inhibition (KT-5720, 100 μM, 15 μl) enhanced pLTF (99 ± 15% 60 min post-AIH; p &lt; 0.05). Conversely, PKA activation (8-br-cAMP, 100 μM, 15 μl) blunted pLTF versus control rats (16 ± 5% versus 45 ± 6% 60 min post-AIH; p &lt; 0.05). These findings suggest a novel mechanism whereby spinal Gs protein-coupled 5-HT7 receptors constrain AIH-induced pLTF via PKA activity.

AB  - Abstract
Central nervous system neurons fail to regenerate after birth, which greatly hampers the effective treatment of many neurodegenerative diseases. Neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells have been considered a possible option for cell-based therapies. Recent discoveries have revealed that fibroblasts can be directly converted into neurons without a transition through a pluripotent state. This approach might serve as a more efficient and convenient method for the cellular therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. Currently, several types of neurons have been directly generated from fibroblasts, including dopamine neurons, motor neurons and neural progenitor cells. In our study, by screening a series of candidate genes, we found that the adenovirus-mediated transduction of Ascl1, Brn3b and Ngn2 can directly convert mouse fibroblasts to retinal ganglion-like cells. The induced retinal ganglion-like cells co-express multiple retinal ganglion cell markers, and exhibit membrane properties of functional neurons. The reprogramming mediated by adenoviruses occurs much sooner than that mediated by lentiviruses. Furthermore, the induced retinal ganglion-like cells that are produced via adenoviral gene delivery are free of exogenous gene integration. Retinal ganglion-like cells that are induced by adenoviruses demonstrate great potential applicability in clinical therapy and provide a novel platform for the research of retinal degenerative diseases.

AB  - Abstract
Persistent exposure to environmental stressors causes dysregulation of the limbic–hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (LHPA) axis and alters GABAA receptor (GABAAR) levels throughout the brain. Social subordination in socially housed female rhesus results in distinctive stress-related physiological and behavioral phenotypes that are dependent on the ovarian hormone estradiol (E2). In the present study, we utilized ovariectomized adult female rhesus monkeys undergoing hormone replacement with E2 to test the hypothesis that the chronic psychosocial stress of subordination alters GABAAR binding potential (GABAAR BPND) in limbic regions implicated in emotional processing including the prefrontal cortex, temporal lobe (amygdala and hippocampus), and hypothalamus. Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis that peripheral administration of a corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) receptor antagonist (astressin B) would reverse the alterations in GABAAR binding within these regions in subordinate females. After subjects received astressin B or saline for three consecutive days, GABAAR BPND was determined by positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-flumazenil as a radioligand. T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were also acquired for PET scan co-registration, in order to perform a region of interest analysis using the pons as a reference region. Compared to socially dominant females, subordinate females exhibited increased GABAAR BPND in the prefrontal cortex but not in the temporal lobe or the hypothalamus. Administration of astressin B eliminated the status difference in GABAAR BPND in the prefrontal cortex, suggesting that the chronic stressor of social subordination modulates GABAergic tone via effects on CRH and the LHPA axis, at least in prefrontal regions.

AB  - Abstract
Abnormal plasticity in the cortico-basal ganglia–thalamocortical loop has been suggested to represent a key factor in the pathophysiology of dystonia. In a model of primary paroxysmal dystonia, the dtsz mutant hamster, previous experiments have shown a strongly increased long-term potentiation (LTP) in comparison to non-dystonic control hamsters. These basal changes, i.e. in the absence of dystonia, were found in young animals at an age of 5 weeks, when the age-dependent dystonia in dtsz mutant reaches highest severity. In the present study we examined in corticostriatal slices (1) whether the increases in synaptic plasticity can be modulated by stressful stimuli which induce dystonic episodes in young mutant hamsters, and (2) whether increases of LTP persist after spontaneous remission of dystonia in animals older than 10 weeks. The present data show that in slices of young mutant hamsters the extent of LTP was not influenced by the presence of dystonia: In comparison to age-matched control hamsters, LTP was increased in mutant hamsters independent of preceding stressful stimulation. After remission of dystonia, i.e., in older dtsz mutant hamsters &gt;10 weeks, only LTP could be elicited, while in preparations from age-matched control hamsters, either LTP or long-term depression developed, depending on previous behavioral challenge. We conclude that in mature brain, corticostriatal connections have the potential for changes in metaplasticity, while in dtsz mutant hamsters this metaplasticity is persistently infringed even though stress-inducible dystonic symptoms are lost.

AB  - Abstract
In both perceptual and motor learning, numerous studies have shown specificity of learning to the trained eye or hand and to the physical features of the task. However, generalization of learning is possible in both perceptual and motor domains. Here, I review evidence for perceptual and motor learning generalization, suggesting that generalization patterns are affected by the way in which the original memory is encoded and consolidated. Generalization may be facilitated during fast learning, with possible engagement of higher-order brain areas recurrently interacting with the primary visual or motor cortices encoding the stimuli or movements’ memories. Such generalization may be supported by sleep, involving functional interactions between low and higher-order brain areas. Repeated exposure to the task may alter generalization patterns of learning and overall offline learning. Development of unifying frameworks across learning modalities and better understanding of the conditions under which learning can generalize may enable to gain insight regarding the neural mechanisms underlying procedural learning and have useful clinical implications.

AB  - Abstract
The rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (rNST) receives orosensory information from taste bud cells in the tongue and palate via cranial nerves VII and IX. These nerves enter the brainstem, form the solitary tract (ST) and synapse with neurons in the rNST, which then relay incoming sensory information to other brain areas to process external gustatory stimuli. Factors that direct or regulate the trajectory of the developing ST are largely unknown. We used 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) to identify ST projections originating from cells in the geniculate ganglia of embryonic rats from embryonic day 14 through 18 (E14–E18). After identifying the ST fibers, immunolabeling for and protein expression analysis of the axon guidance molecules neuropilin-1 (Npn-1) and neuropilin-2 (Npn-2) and their binding partners, semaphorin-3A (Sema-3A) and semaphorin-3F (Sema-3F) were performed. The results detail the formation of ST projections into the gustatory brainstem and their relationship to developing rNST neurons. DiI-labeled ST fibers were present in the brainstem as early as E14. Npn-1 was expressed in the ST and in the trigeminal tract at E14, but levels of the protein declined through E18. The expression levels of the binding partner of Npn-1, Sema-3A, increased from E14 to E18. Npn-2 was expressed in the ST and, additionally, in radially oriented, tuft-like structures within the brainstem at E14. Expression levels of Npn-2 also declined through E18, in contrast to the expression levels of its binding partner, Sema-3F, which increased during this time period. For the first time, the time course and particular molecular components involved in development of the ST have been identified. These results indicate that the neuropilin and semaphorin families of axon guidance molecules are potential molecular participants in ST formation.

AB  - Abstract
Organic cation transporters (OCTs) are expressed mainly in the kidney and liver. OCTs transport intrinsic organic cations, including monoamine, dopamine, serotonine and choline, across the plasma membrane. Here, we demonstrate that OCT2 (SLC22A2) is expressed in cholinergic neurons, motoneurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, and is implicated in acetylcholine (Ach) recycling in presynaptic terminals. Application of rabbit anti-peptide antibody revealed that OCT2 was expressed in the anterior horn of the spinal cord. Double immunostaining of muscle sections with anti-OCT2 and alpha-bungarotoxin (BTX) revealed that OCT2 was localized in the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that OCT2 was localized both in synaptic vesicles (SVs) in presynaptic terminals around the motoneurons (C-terminals) and in SVs in nerve terminals in NMJs. The similarity in the distribution of OCT2 in cholinergic neurons and that of vesicular acetyl choline transporter (VAchT), and the fact that OCT2 can transport choline suggest that OCT2 could work as a low-affinity and high-capacity choline transporter at presynaptic terminals in cholinergic neurons in a firing-dependent manner.

AB  - Abstract
Temporary neuronal inactivation of the ventral hippocampus with the GABAA agonist muscimol suppresses unconditioned fear behavior (anxiety) but inactivation of the dorsal hippocampus does not. On the other hand, inactivating the dorsal hippocampus disrupts fear memory, while inactivating the ventral hippocampus does not. Here we investigate the roles of hippocampal GABAA receptor sub-units in mediating these anxiolytic and amnesic effects of GABAA receptor agonists. We microinfused TPA023 (α2 agonist) or TB-21007 (inverse α5 agonist) into the dorsal or ventral hippocampus prior to testing rats in two animal models of anxiety: the elevated plus-maze and shock-probe burying test. Twenty-four hours later rats were re-tested in the shock-probe chamber with a non-electrified probe to assess their memory of the initial shock-probe experience (i.e., fear memory). We found that TPA023 was anxiolytic in the plus-maze and shock-probe burying tests when microinfused into the ventral hippocampus. However, TPA023 did not affect anxiety-related behavior when infused into the dorsal hippocampus. Conversely, we found that the α5 sub-unit inverse agonist TB-21007 impaired rats’ memory of the initial shock-probe experience when infused into the dorsal hippocampus, but not when infused into the ventral hippocampus. This double dissociation suggests that α2 GABAA receptor sub-units in the ventral hippocampus mediate unconditioned fear or anxiety, while α5 GABAA receptor sub-units in the dorsal hippocampus mediate conditioned fear memory.

This paper on Rita Levi-Montalcini (1909–2012), who received in 1986 the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of nerve growth factor, focuses on aspects of her advocacy and her commitment to education in which she has been especially active in the last part of her long life. With passionate confidence on the capabilities of the aging brain (together with severe admonition against the pursuit of immortality), she encouraged contributions of senior citizens to the society. Always projected into the future, with enduring faith in the potential of young individuals, in education as a key to development, in the capabilities of women, in the importance of gender equality, Rita established in 2001 the Rita Levi-Montalcini Foundation for the education of African women. Her legacy on engagement for a better ‘global village’ should not be forgotten by the neuroscience community.

AB  - Abstract
Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is reported to protect neurons from apoptosis induced by various stresses including hypoxia–ischemia (HI). However, the mechanisms by which TERT exerts its anti-apoptotic role in neurons with HI injury remain unclear. In this study, we examined the protective role and explored the possible mechanisms of TERT in neurons with HI injury in vitro. Primary cultured neurons were exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) for 3 h followed by reperfusion to mimic HI injury in vivo. Plasmids containing TERT antisense, sense nucleotides, or mock were transduced into neurons at 48 h before OGD. Expression and distribution of TERT were measured by immunofluorescence labeling and western blot. The expression of cleaved caspase 3 (CC3), Bcl-2 and Bax were detected by western blot. Neuronal apoptosis was measured with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL). The mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by MitoSOX Red staining. Fluorescent probe JC-1 was used to measure the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). We found that TERT expression increased at 8 h and peaked at 24 h in neurons after OGD. CC3 expression and neuronal apoptosis were induced and peaked at 24 h after OGD. TERT inhibition significantly increased CC3 expression and neuronal apoptosis after OGD treatment. Additionally, TERT inhibition decreased the expression ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, and enhanced ROS production and ΔΨm dissipation after OGD. These data suggest that TERT plays a neuroprotective role via anti-apoptosis in neurons after OGD. The underlying mechanisms may be associated with regulating Bcl-2/Bax expression ratio, attenuating ROS generation, and increasing mitochondrial membrane potential.

Experience-dependent plasticity is an ongoing process that can be observed and measured at multiple levels. The first goal of this study was to examine the effects of prenatal nicotine on the performance of rats in three behavioral tasks (elevated plus maze (EPM), Morris water task (MWT), and Whishaw tray reaching). The second goal of this experiment sought to examine changes in dendritic organization following exposure to the behavioral training paradigm and/or low doses of prenatal nicotine. Female Long-Evans rats were administered daily injections of nicotine for the duration of pregnancy and their pups underwent a regimen of behavioral training in early adulthood (EPM, MWT, and Whishaw tray reaching). All offspring exposed to nicotine prenatally exhibited substantial increases in anxiety. Male offspring also showed increased efficiency in the Whishaw tray-reaching task and performed differently than the other groups in the probe trial of the MWT. Using Golgi-Cox staining we examined the dendritic organization of the medial and orbital prefrontal cortex as well as the nucleus accumbens. Participation in the behavioral training paradigm was associated with dramatic reorganization of dendritic morphology and spine density in all brain regions examined. Although both treatments (behavior training and prenatal nicotine exposure) markedly altered dendritic organization, the effects of the behavioral experience were much larger than those of the prenatal drug exposure, and in some cases interacted with the drug effects.

AB  - Abstract
In recent years, both major depression and antidepressant therapy have been linked to adult hippocampal neurogenesis. The hippocampus is not a homogeneous brain area, and a converging body of evidence indicates a functional dissociation along its septo-temporal axis, the dorsal part being involved more in learning/memory and spatial navigation, while the ventral sub-region is linked more to emotional behavior and regulation of the neuroendocrine stress axis. Research has therefore been conducted in an attempt to relate effects of models of depression and of antidepressant therapies to adult neurogenesis along the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus. The present paper reviews the current literature addressing this question and discusses the possible mechanisms involved and the functional significance of such regional effects. This review shows that animal models of depression elicit an effect restricted to the ventral hippocampus more frequently than a dorsal-specific effect. However, this is also stage specific, and concerns neurogenesis, rather than cell proliferation or survival. Surprisingly, the same does not apply regarding the effects of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors that act in a more uniform way on dorsal and ventral adult neurogenesis in most studies. Some recently introduced clinical compounds (e.g., agomelatine) or putative antidepressants have a specific action on the ventral sub-region, indicating that an action restricted to this part of the brain may be sufficient to achieve remission. Finally, non-pharmacological manipulations that are also endowed with antidepressant effects, such as environmental enrichment or physical exercise, also act on both subdivisions, although some studies pointed to specificity of dorsal neurogenesis. The different treatments, acting either on the dorsal or on the ventral sub-regions, could promote recovery by improving either ventral- or dorsal-related functions, both contributing in a different way to treatment efficacy.

AB  - Abstract
Perineuronal net (PNN) is a specialized aggregate of the extracellular matrix, which is considered to be involved in regulation of structural plasticity of neuronal circuits. Here we examined the spatial and temporal differences in Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-labeled PNN intensity in single cells in the mouse hippocampus, where the neuronal circuits engaged in cognition and emotion are embedded in the dorsal and ventral parts, respectively. In young mice, the intensity of PNN was very low, and there were no significant dorsoventral differences in all hippocampal regions. Developmental increase in PNN intensity was larger in the dorsal part than in the ventral part. As a result, PNN intensity was higher in the dorsal part than in the ventral part in adult mice. Aging dissimilarly affects different regions of the dorsal hippocampus. Namely, PNN intensity in the dorsal part of old mice declined in the CA1 region, remained unchanged in the CA3 region, increased in the dentate gyrus. By contrast, there were no significant aging-related changes in PNN intensity in the ventral hippocampus. We also examined the intensity of parvalbumin (PV), an EF-hand calcium-binding protein, because it has been shown that PNNs are closely related to PV-containing GABAergic inhibitory neurons. Contrary to expectations, developmental and aging-related changes in PV intensity were not comparable to those seen in PNN intensity. The correlation coefficients between PNN and PV intensities in single cells showed gradual decline during development and aging in the CA1 and CA3 regions, while there were little correlations in the dentate gyrus regardless of age. In summary, PNNs are differentially expressed in the dorsal and ventral hippocampal circuits during development and aging, indicating their possible role for cognition and emotion control.

AB  - Abstract
Activation of glutamate receptors within the ventral tegmental area (VTA) stimulates extrasynaptic (basal) dopamine release in terminal regions, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Hindbrain inputs from the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT) are critical for elicitation of phasic VTA dopamine cell activity and consequent transient dopamine release. This study investigated the role of VTA ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) stimulation on both basal and LDT electrical stimulation-evoked dopamine efflux in the NAc using in vivo chronoamperometry and fixed potential amperometry in combination with stearate-graphite paste and carbon fiber electrodes, respectively. Intra-VTA infusion of the iGluR agonists (±)-α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA; 1 μg/μl) or N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA; 2 μg/μl) enhanced basal NAc dopamine efflux. This iGluR-mediated potentiation of basal dopamine efflux was paralleled by an attenuation of LDT-evoked transient NAc dopamine efflux, suggesting that excitation of basal activity effectively inhibited the capacity of hindbrain afferents to elicit transient dopamine efflux. In line with this, post-NMDA infusion of the dopamine D2 autoreceptor (D2R) agonist quinpirole (1 μg/μl; intra-VTA) partially recovered NMDA-mediated attenuation of LDT-evoked NAc dopamine, while concurrently attenuating NMDA-mediated potentiation of basal dopamine efflux. Post-NMDA infusion of quinpirole (1 μg/μl) alone attenuated basal and LDT-evoked dopamine efflux. Taken together, these data reveal that hyperstimulation of basal dopamine transmission can stunt hindbrain burst-like stimulation-evoked dopamine efflux. Inhibitory autoreceptor mechanisms within the VTA help to partially recover the magnitude of phasic dopamine efflux, highlighting the importance of both iGluRs and D2 autoreceptors in maintaining the functional balance of tonic and phasic dopamine neurotransmission. Dysregulation of this balance may have important implications for disorders of dopamine dysregulation such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

AB  - Abstract
Cocaine addiction is driven by genetic, neurologic and environmental components. The D1-like (D1 and D5) and D2-like (D2, D3 and D4) families of dopamine receptors play an important role in modulating the effects of cocaine administration on drug-seeking behavior. The advent of bacterial artificial chromosome-eGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) transgenic mice that express eGFP driven by the endogenous D1-receptor (D1-r) or D2-receptor (D2-r) promoters provides a unique opportunity to distinguish between these subpopulations of cells. In an effort to identify cocaine-induced alterations in D1-r- versus D2-r-expressing cells during the initial stages of addiction, we examined cells that expressed D1-rs in Drd1-eGFP mice, or D2-rs in Drd2-eGFP mice, after an acute, 1-day binge pattern of cocaine administration. We used multiphoton confocal microscopy and Visiopharm© software, to conduct unbiased stereological counts of D1-r-labeled or D2-r-labeled cells in various striatal regions. Mice were sacrificed at 30 min and 24-h post cocaine or saline administration. Compared to saline controls, Drd1-eGFP mice that received cocaine had a higher count of D1-r-labeled cells in the dorsolateral (DL) striatum, at the 30-min and 24-h time-points. No changes in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core or shell were observed in Drd1-eGFP mice. Drd2-eGFP mice that received cocaine had fewer D2-r-labeled cells in the DL striatum and NAc core compared to saline controls. This effect was observed at the 30-min time-point but not at 24 h. Drd2-eGFP mice that received cocaine also had fewer numbers of D2-r-labeled cells in the NAc core compared to saline controls, but no significant differences in the number of D2-r-labeled cells in the NAc shell. These results suggest that acute binge pattern cocaine administration may induce region-specific alterations in D1-r or D2-receptor gene expression, and may help elucidate the differential role of dopamine receptors in the initial stages of the addiction cycle.

AB  - Abstract
Methamphetamine (METH) is an addictive stimulant drug. In addition to drug craving and lethargy, METH withdrawal is associated with stress-triggered anxiety. However, the cellular basis for this stress-triggered anxiety is not understood. The present results suggest that during METH withdrawal (24 h) following chronic exposure (3 mg/kg, i.p. for 3–5 weeks) of adult, male mice, the effect of one neurosteroid released by stress, 3α,5α-THP (3α-OH-5α-pregnan-20-one), and its 3α,5β isomer reverse to trigger anxiety assessed by the acoustic startle response (ASR), in contrast to their usual anti-anxiety effects. This novel effect of 3α,5β-THP was due to increased (three-fold) hippocampal expression of α4βδ GABAA receptors (GABARs) during METH withdrawal (24 h–4 weeks) because anxiogenic effects of 3α,5β-THP were not seen in α4−/− mice. 3α,5β-THP reduces current at these receptors when it is hyperpolarizing, as observed during METH withdrawal. As a result, 3α,5β-THP (30 nM) increased neuronal excitability, assessed with current clamp and cell-attached recordings in CA1 hippocampus, one CNS site which regulates anxiety. α4βδ GABARs were first increased 1 h after METH exposure and recovered 6 weeks after METH withdrawal. Similar increases in α4βδ GABARs and anxiogenic effects of 3α,5β-THP were noted in rats during METH withdrawal (24 h). In contrast, the ASR was increased by chronic METH treatment in the absence of 3α,5β-THP administration due to its stimulant effect. Although α4βδ GABARs were increased by chronic METH treatment, the GABAergic current recorded from hippocampal neurons at this time was a depolarizing, shunting inhibition, which was potentiated by 3α,5β-THP. This steroid reduced neuronal excitability and anxiety during chronic METH treatment, consistent with its typical effect. Flumazenil (10 mg/kg, i.p., 3×) reduced α4βδ expression and prevented the anxiogenic effect of 3α,5β-THP after METH withdrawal. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism underlying stress-triggered anxiety after METH withdrawal mediated by α4βδ GABARs.

AB  - Abstract
Neural plasticity has been observed in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) following exposure to both cocaine and androgenic–anabolic steroids. Here we investigated the involvement of the BNST on changes in cardiovascular function and baroreflex activity following either single or combined administration of cocaine and testosterone for 10 consecutive days in rats. Single administration of testosterone increased values of arterial pressure, evoked rest bradycardia and reduced baroreflex-mediated bradycardia. These effects of testosterone were not affected by BNST inactivation caused by local bilateral microinjections of the nonselective synaptic blocker CoCl2. The single administration of cocaine as well as the combined treatment with testosterone and cocaine increased both bradycardiac and tachycardiac responses of the baroreflex. Cocaine-evoked baroreflex changes were totally reversed after BNST inactivation. However, BNST inhibition in animals subjected to combined treatment with cocaine and testosterone reversed only the increase in reflex tachycardia, whereas facilitation of reflex bradycardia was not affected by local BNST treatment with CoCl2. In conclusion, the present study provides the first direct evidence that the BNST play a role in cardiovascular changes associated with drug abuse. Our findings suggest that alterations in cardiovascular function following subchronic exposure to cocaine are mediated by neural plasticity in the BNST. The single treatment with cocaine and the combined administration of testosterone and cocaine had similar effects on baroreflex activity, however the association with testosterone inhibited cocaine-induced changes in the BNST control of reflex bradycardia. Testosterone-induced cardiovascular changes seem to be independent of the BNST.

AB  - Abstract
Although surgical trauma activates the anterior pituitary gland and elicits an increase in prolactin (PRL) serum levels that can modulate nociceptive responses, the role of PRL and the PRL-receptor (PRL-R) in thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia in postoperative pain is unknown. Acute postoperative pain condition was generated with the use of the hindpaw plantar incision model. Results showed endogenous PRL levels were significantly increased in serum, operated hindpaw and spinal cords of male and female rats 24 h after incision. These alterations were especially pronounced in females. We then examined the role of the PRL system in thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia in male and female mice 3–168 h after plantar incision with the use of knock-out (KO) mice with PRL or PRL-R gene ablations and in wild-type (WT) mice. WT mice showed postoperative cold hyperalgesia in a sex-dependent manner (only in females), but with no effect on heat hyperalgesia or mechanical allodynia in either sex. Studies in KO mice showed no effect of PRL and PRL-R gene ablation on heat and cold hyperalgesia in male mice, while heat hyperlgesia were reduced 3–72 h post-surgery in female PRL and PRL-R KO mice. In contrast, PRL and PRL-R ablations significantly attenuated mechanical allodynia 3–72 h post-surgery in both male and female mice. Overall, we found elevated PRL levels in serum, hindpaws and spinal cords after incision, and identify a contributory role for the PRL system in postoperative pain responses to thermal stimuli in females and to mechanical stimuli in both males and females.

AB  - Abstract
In rodents as well as in many other mammalian and non-mammalian species, the arginine-vasopressin (AVP) system includes a parvocellular sexually dimorphic portion located within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), the medial amygdaloid nucleus (MeA) and the lateral septum. In this system, males have more cells and denser projections than females, neurons show androgen and estrogen receptors, and gonadal hormones are required for the activation. However, the role of these hormones for the differentiation of the system is not clear. Previous studies performed on aromatase knockout mice suggested that estradiol is not necessary for the differentiation of the system, but it is important for its activation in adulthood.

To elucidate the role of androgens on differentiation and functioning of AVP parvocellular system, we compared male and female rats with a non-functional mutation of androgen receptor (Tfm, testicular feminization mutation) to their control littermates. Our data show that the lack of a functional androgen receptor significantly decreases the expression of AVP immunoreactivity within the BST and MeA of male Tfm. Thus supporting the hypothesis that androgens, through the action of their receptor, should have a relevant role in the organization and modulation of the AVP parvocellular sexually dimorphic system.

AB  - Abstract
Molecular and cellular mechanisms of brain injury after exposure to blast overpressure (BOP) are not clearly known. The present study hypothesizes that pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory pathways in the brain may be responsible for neuronal loss and behavioral deficits following BOP exposure. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were anesthetized and exposed to calibrated BOP of 129.23 ± 3.01 kPa while controls received only anesthesia. In situ dihydroethidium fluorescence staining revealed that BOP significantly increased the production of reactive oxygen species in the brain. In addition, real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated a significant up-regulation of mRNA and protein expressions of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as interferon-γ and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, in brains collected from BOP-exposed animals compared with the controls. Furthermore, immunoreactivity of neuronal nuclei in brains indicated that fewer neurons were present following BOP exposure. Moreover, novel object recognition paradigm showed a significant impairment in the short-term memory at 2 weeks following BOP exposure. These results suggest that pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory environments in the brain could play a potential role in BOP-induced neuronal loss and behavioral deficits. It may provide a foundation for defining a molecular and cellular basis of the pathophysiology of blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT). It will also contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches selectively targeting these pathways, which have great potential in the diagnosis and therapy of BINT.

AB  - Abstract
Prior adverse experience alters behavioral responses to subsequent stressors. For example, exposure to a brief swim increases immobility in a subsequent swim test 24 h later. In order to determine if qualitative differences (e.g. 19 °C versus 25 °C) in an initial stressor (15-min swim) impact behavioral, physiological, and associated neural responses in a 5-min, 25 °C swim test 24 h later, rats were surgically implanted with biotelemetry devices 1 week prior to experimentation then randomly assigned to one of six conditions (Day 1 (15 min)/Day 2 (5 min)): (1) home cage (HC)/HC, (2) HC/25 °C swim, (3) 19 °C swim/HC, (4) 19 °C swim/25 °C swim, (5) 25 °C swim/HC, (6) 25 °C swim/25 °C swim. Core body temperature (Tb) was measured on Days 1 and 2 using biotelemetry; behavior was measured on Day 2. Rats were transcardially perfused with fixative 2 h following the onset of the swim on Day 2 for analysis of c-Fos expression in midbrain serotonergic neurons. Cold water (19 °C) swim on Day 1 reduced Tb, compared to both 25 °C swim and HC groups on Day 1, and, relative to rats exposed to HC conditions on Day 1, reduced the hypothermic response to the 25 °C swim on Day 2. The 19 °C swim on Day 1, relative to HC exposure on Day 1, increased immobility during the 5-min swim on Day 2. Also, 19 °C swim, relative to HC conditions, on Day 1 reduced swim (25 °C)-induced increases in c-Fos expression in serotonergic neurons within the dorsal and interfascicular parts of the dorsal raphe nucleus. These results suggest that exposure to a 5-min 19 °C cold water swim, but not exposure to a 5-min 25 °C swim alters physiological, behavioral and serotonergic responses to a subsequent stressor.

AB  - Abstract
The auditory system continuously monitors the environment for irregularities in an automatic, preattentive fashion. This is presumably accomplished by two mechanisms: a sensory mechanism detects a deviant sound on the basis of differential refractoriness of neural populations sensitive to the standard and deviant sounds, whereas the cognitive mechanism reveals deviance by comparing incoming auditory information with a template derived from previous input. Using fast event-related high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging at 7 Tesla we show that both mechanisms can be mapped to different parts of the auditory cortex both at the group level and the single-subject level. The sensory mechanism is supported by primary auditory areas in Heschl’s gyrus whereas the cognitive mechanism is implemented in more anterior secondary auditory areas. Both mechanisms are equally engaged by simple sine-wave tones and speech-related phonemes indicating that streams of speech and non-speech stimuli are processed in a similar fashion.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic neuropathic pain is a frequent comorbidity following spinal cord injury (SCI) and often fails to respond to conventional pain management strategies. Preventive administration of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or the consumption of a diet rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (O3PUFAs) confers potent prophylaxis against SCI and improves functional recovery. The present study examines whether this novel dietary strategy provides significant antinociceptive benefits in rats experiencing SCI-induced pain. Rats were fed control chow or chow enriched with O3PUFAs for 8 weeks before being subjected to sham or cord contusion surgeries, continuing the same diets after surgery for another 8 more weeks. The paw sensitivity to noxious heat was quantified for at least 8 weeks post-SCI using the Hargreaves test. We found that SCI rats consuming the preventive O3PUFA-enriched diet exhibited a significant reduction in thermal hyperalgesia compared to those consuming the normal diet. Functional neurometabolomic profiling revealed a distinctive deregulation in the metabolism of endocannabinoids (eCB) and related N-acyl ethanolamines (NAEs) at 8 weeks post-SCI. We found that O3PUFAs consumption led to a robust accumulation of novel NAE precursors, including the glycerophospho-containing docosahexaenoyl ethanolamine (DHEA), docosapentaenoyl ethanolamine (DPEA), and eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamine (EPEA). The tissue levels of these metabolites were significantly correlated with the antihyperalgesic phenotype. In addition, rats consuming the O3PUFA-rich diet showed reduced sprouting of nociceptive fibers containing CGRP and dorsal horn neuron p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) expression, well-established biomarkers of pain. The spinal cord levels of inositols were positively correlated with thermal hyperalgesia, supporting their role as biomarkers of chronic neuropathic pain. Notably, the O3PUFA-rich dietary intervention reduced the levels of these metabolites. Collectively, these results demonstrate the prophylactic value of dietary O3PUFA against SCI-mediated chronic pain.

AB  - Abstract
Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are pressing medical issues for the Warfighter. Symptoms of mTBI can overlap with those of PTSD, suggesting the possibility of a causal or mediating role of mTBI in PTSD. To address whether mTBI can exacerbate the neurobiological processes associated with traumatic stress, we evaluated the impact of mTBI from a blast overpressure (BOP) on the expression of a conditioned fear. In the rat, conditioned fear models are used to evaluate the emotional conditioning processes that are known to become dysfunctional in PTSD. Rats were first trained on a variable interval (VI), food maintained, operant conditioning task that established a general measure of performance. Inescapable electric shock (IES) was paired with an audio-visual conditioned stimulus (CS) and followed 1 day later by three daily exposures to BOP (75 kPa). Subsequently, the CS alone was presented once every 7 days for 2 months, beginning 4 days following the last BOP. The CS was presented during the VI sessions allowing a concurrent measure of performance. Treatment groups (n = 10, each group) received IES + BOP, IES + sham-BOP, sham-IES + BOP or sham-IES + sham-BOP. As expected, pairing the CS with IES produced a robust conditioned fear that was quantified by a suppression of responding on the VI. BOP significantly decreased the expression of the conditioned fear. No systematic short- or long-term performance deficits were observed on the VI from BOP. These results show that mTBI from BOP can affect the expression of a conditioned fear and suggests that BOP caused a decrease in inhibitory behavioral control. Continued presentation of the CS produced progressively less response suppression in both fear conditioned treatments, consistent with extinction of the conditioned fear. Taken together, these results show that mTBI from BOP can affect the expression of a conditioned fear but not necessarily in a manner that increases the conditioned fear or extends the extinction process.

AB  - Abstract
Ras homolog enriched in striatum (Rhes), is a highly conserved small guanosine-5′-triphosphate (GTP) binding protein belonging to the Ras superfamily. Rhes is involved in the dopamine receptor-mediated signaling and behavior though adenylyl cyclase. The striatum-specific GTPase share a close homology with Dexras1, which regulates iron trafficking in the neurons when activated though the post-translational modification called s-nitrosylation by nitric oxide (NO). We report that Rhes physiologically interacted with Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor-associated protein7 and participated in iron uptake via divalent metal transporter 1 similar to Dexras1. Interestingly, Rhes is not S-nitrosylated by NO-treatment, however phosphorylated by protein kinase A at the site of serine-239. Two Rhes mutants – the phosphomimetic form (serine 239 to aspartic acid) and constitutively active form (alanine 173 to valine) – displayed an increase in iron uptake compared to the wild-type Rhes. These findings suggest that Rhes may play a crucial role in striatal iron homeostasis.

AB  - Abstract
Intake of a Western diet (WD), which is high in saturated fat and sugar, is associated with deficits in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory processes as well as with markers of hippocampal pathology. In the present study, rats were trained to asymptote on hippocampal-dependent serial feature negative (FN) and hippocampal-independent simple discrimination problems. Performance was then assessed following 7 days on ad libitum chow and after 10, 24, 40, 60, and 90 days of maintenance on WD, on ketogenic (KETO) diet, which is high in saturated fat and low in sugar and other carbohydrates, or continued maintenance on chow (CHOW). Confirming and extending previous findings, diet-induced obese (DIO) rats fed WD showed impaired FN performance, increased blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and increased fasting blood glucose levels compared to CHOW controls and to diet-resistant (DR) rats that did not become obese when maintained on WD. For rats fed the KETO diet, FN performance and BBB integrity were more closely associated with level of circulating ketone bodies than with obesity phenotype (DR or DIO), with higher levels of ketones appearing to provide a protective effect. The evidence also indicated that FN deficits preceded and predicted increased body weight and adiposity. This research (a) further substantiates previous findings of WD-induced deficits in hippocampal-dependent FN discriminations, (b) suggests that ketones may be protective against diet-induced cognitive impairment, and (c) provides evidence that diet-induced cognitive impairment precedes weight gain and obesity.

AB  - Abstract
The commission of an error triggers cognitive control processes dedicated to error correction and prevention. Post-error adjustments leading to response slowing following an error (“post-error slowing”; PES) might be driven by changes in excitability of the motor regions and the corticospinal tract (CST). The time-course of such excitability modulations of the CST leading to PES is largely unknown. To track these presumed excitability changes after an error, single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied to the motor cortex ipsilateral to the responding hand, while participants were performing an Eriksen flanker task. A robotic arm with a movement compensation system was used to maintain the TMS coil in the correct position during the experiment. Magnetic pulses were delivered over the primary motor cortex ipsilateral to the active hand at different intervals (150, 300, 450 ms) after correct and erroneous responses, and the motor-evoked potentials (MEP) of the first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) contralateral to the stimulated hemisphere were recorded. MEP amplitude was increased 450 ms after the error. Two additional experiments showed that this increase was neither associated to the correction of the erroneous responses nor to the characteristics of the motor command. To the extent to which the excitability of the motor cortex ipsi- and contralateral to the response hand are inversely related, these results suggest a decrease in the excitability of the active motor cortex after an erroneous response. This modulation of the activity of the CST serves to prevent further premature and erroneous responses. At a more general level, the study shows the power of the TMS technique for the exploration of the temporal evolution of post-error adjustments within the motor system.

AB  - Abstract
Crush injuries of peripheral nerves typically lead to axonotmesis, axonal damage without disruption of connective tissue sheaths. Generally, human patients and experimental animals recover well after axonotmesis and the favorable outcome has been attributed to precise axonal reinnervation of the original peripheral targets. Here we assessed functionally and morphologically the long-term consequences of facial nerve axonotmesis in rats. Expectedly, we found that 5 months after crush or cryogenic nerve lesion, the numbers of motoneurons with regenerated axons and their projection pattern into the main branches of the facial nerve were similar to those in control animals suggesting precise target reinnervation. Unexpectedly, however, we found that functional recovery, estimated by vibrissal motion analysis, was incomplete at 2 months after injury and did not improve thereafter. The maximum amplitude of whisking remained substantially, by more than 30% lower than control values even 5 months after axonotmesis. Morphological analyses showed that the facial motoneurons ipsilateral to injury were innervated by lower numbers of glutamatergic terminals (−15%) and cholinergic perisomatic boutons (−26%) compared with the contralateral non-injured motoneurons. The structural deficits were correlated with functional performance of individual animals and associated with microgliosis in the facial nucleus but not with polyinnervation of muscle fibers. These results support the idea that restricted CNS plasticity and insufficient afferent inputs to motoneurons may substantially contribute to functional deficits after facial nerve injuries, possibly including pathologic conditions in humans like axonotmesis in idiopathic facial nerve (Bell’s) palsy.

AB  - Abstract
In nocturnal rodents, brain areas that promote wakefulness have a circadian pattern of neural activation that mirrors the sleep/wake cycle, with more neural activation during the active phase than during the rest phase. To investigate whether differences in temporal patterns of neural activity in wake-promoting regions contribute to differences in daily patterns of wakefulness between nocturnal and diurnal species, we assessed Fos expression patterns in the tuberomammillary (TMM), supramammillary (SUM), and raphe nuclei of male grass rats maintained in a 12:12 h light–dark cycle. Day–night profiles of Fos expression were observed in the ventral and dorsal TMM, in the SUM, and in specific subpopulations of the raphe, including serotonergic cells, with higher Fos expression during the day than during the night. Next, to explore whether the cerebrospinal fluid is an avenue used by the TMM and raphe in the regulation of target areas, we injected the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit beta (CTB) into the ventricular system of male grass rats. While CTB labeling was scarce in the TMM and other hypothalamic areas including the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which contains the main circadian pacemaker, a dense cluster of CTB-positive neurons was evident in the caudal dorsal raphe, and the majority of these neurons appeared to be serotonergic. Since these findings are in agreement with reports for nocturnal rodents, our results suggest that the evolution of diurnality did not involve a change in the overall distribution of neuronal connections between systems that support wakefulness and their target areas, but produced a complete temporal reversal in the functioning of those systems.

AB  - Abstract
Tetrabenazine (TBZ) is a reversible inhibitor of vesicular monoamine storage that is used to treat Huntington’s disease. TBZ preferentially depletes striatal dopamine (DA), and patients being treated with TBZ often experience parkinsonian side effects. The present studies were conducted to investigate the ability of TBZ to induce tremulous jaw movements (TJMs), which are a rodent model of parkinsonian tremor, and to determine if interference with adenosine A2A receptor transmission can attenuate TJMs and other motor effects of TBZ. In rats, TBZ (0.25–2.0 mg/kg) significantly induced TJMs, which primarily occurred in the 3.0–7.5-Hz frequency range. The adenosine A2A antagonist MSX-3 (1.25–10.0 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the TJMs induced by 2.0 mg/kg TBZ in rats, and also significantly reduced the display of catalepsy and locomotor suppression induced by TBZ. In mice, TBZ (2.5–10.0 mg/kg) dose dependently induced TJMs, and adenosine A2A receptor knockout mice showed significantly fewer TJMs compared to wild-type controls. MSX-3 (2.5–10.0 mg/kg) also significantly reduced TBZ-induced TJMs in CD1 mice. To provide a cellular marker of these pharmacological conditions, we examined c-Fos expression in the ventrolateral neostriatum (VLS). TBZ (2.0 mg/kg) significantly increased the number of c-Fos-positive cells in the VLS, which is indicative of reduced DA D2 receptor transmission, and 10.0 mg/kg MSX-3 significantly attenuated the TBZ-induced c-Fos expression. These results indicate that TBZ induces tremor as measured by the TJM model, and that pharmacological antagonism and genetic deletion of adenosine A2A receptors are capable of attenuating this oral tremor.

Substantial epidemiological evidence shows an increased risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in people with diabetes. Yet the underlying molecular mechanisms still remain to be elucidated. This article reviews the current studies on common pathological processes of Alzheimer’s disease and diabetes with particular focus on potential mechanisms through which diabetes affects the initiation and progression of Alzheimer’s disease. Impairment of insulin signaling, inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, advanced glycation end products, APOEɛ4 and cholesterol appear to be important mediators and are likely to act synergistically in promoting AD pathology.

AB  - Abstract
Bradykinin (BK) and its receptors (B1 and B2) may exert a role in the pathophysiology of certain CNS diseases, including epilepsy. In healthy tissues, B2 receptors are constitutively and widely expressed and B1 receptors are absent or expressed at very low levels, but both receptors, particularly B1, are up-regulated under many pathological conditions. Available data support the notion that up-regulation of B1 receptors in brain areas like the amygdala, hippocampus and entorhinal cortex favors the development and maintenance of an epileptic condition. The role of B2 receptors, instead, is still unclear. In this study, we used two different models to investigate the susceptibility to seizures of B1 knockout (KO) and B2 KO mice. We found that B1 KO are more susceptible to seizures compared with wild-type (WT) mice, and that this may depend on B2 receptors, in that (i) B2 receptors are overexpressed in limbic areas of B1 KO mice, including the hippocampus and the piriform cortex; (ii) hippocampal slices prepared from B1 KO mice are more excitable than those prepared from WT controls, and this phenomenon is B2 receptor-dependent, being abolished by B2 antagonists; (iii) kainate seizure severity is attenuated by pretreatment with a non-peptide B2 antagonist in WT and (more effectively) in B1 KO mice. These data highlight the possibility that B2 receptors may have a role in the responsiveness to epileptogenic insults and/or in the early period of epileptogenesis, that is, in the onset of the molecular and cellular events that lead to the transformation of a normal brain into an epileptic one.

AB  - Abstract
This study characterizes the different response patterns of sleep and wakefulness (W) to short light–dark (LD) cycles in albino mice and examines whether retinal degeneration resulting from prolonged bright light treatment and/or rd/rd mutation alters such response patterns. Eight young male Institute for Cancer Research (ICR) mice with normal eyes, seven young male rd/rd Friend Virus B type (FVB) mice, six young ICR and five young rd/rd FVB mice receiving 48-h bright light treatment, and five older rd/rd FVB mice were implanted with skull and muscle electrodes to record sleep and W. All the mice were maintained in 12-h–12-h LD cycles at baseline and received 2 days of short LD cycle treatment, which included 5-min–5-min LD cycles for a total of 24 cycles presented 4 h after lights-on and again 4 h after lights-off. All the five mouse groups maintained photo-entrainment of sleep and W rhythms at the baseline and showed a preference for paradoxical sleep (PS) occurrence in the 5-min dark period and non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) in the 5-min light period and a brief alerting effect of light onset on experimental days. Retinal degeneration rising from bright light treatment and/or genetic mutation failed to eliminate or reduce the response of PS and NREMS to short LD cycles, although it enhanced the LD contrast of W, i.e., bright light treatment prolonged the alerting effect of light and the rd mutation increased the suppressing effect of the dark on W. These results suggest that sleep responses to short LD cycles and the brief alerting effect of light were independent of the photoreceptors in the outer retina. Furthermore, the residual photoreceptors in the outer retina and/or the photosensitive cells in the inner retina may actively modulate the effect of light and dark signals on W.

AB  - Abstract
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent debilitating psychiatric mood that contributes to increased rates of disability and suicide. However, the pathophysiology underlying MDD remains poorly understood. A growing number of studies have associated dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) with depression, but no proteomic study has been conducted to assess PFC protein expression in a preclinical model of depression.

Using the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rat model of depression, differential protein expression between the PFC proteomes of CUMS and control rats was assessed through two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-tandem mass spectrometry. Differential protein expression was analyzed for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway over-representation. Four differential proteins were selected for Western blotting validation.

Twenty-nine differential proteins were identified in the PFC of CUMS rats relative to control rats. Through KEGG analysis, energy and glutathione metabolic pathways were determined to be the most significantly altered biological pathways. Two of the four differential proteins selected for Western blotting validation – glyoxalase 1 and dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 – were found to be significantly downregulated in CUMS relative to control rats.

In conclusion, proteomic analysis reveals that energy and glutathione metabolism are the most significantly altered biological pathways in the CUMS rat model of depression. Further investigation on these processes and proteins in the PFC is key to a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of MDD.

AB  - Abstract
Sex differences in brain and behavior exist across vertebrates, but the molecular factors regulating their development are largely unknown. Songbirds exhibit substantial sexual dimorphisms. In zebra finches, only males sing, and the brain areas regulating song learning and production are much larger in males. Recent data suggest that sex chromosome genes (males ZZ; females ZW) may play roles in sexual differentiation. The present studies tested the hypothesis that a Z-gene, tubulin-specific chaperone protein A (TBCA), contributes to sexual differentiation of the song system. This taxonomically conserved gene is integral to microtubule synthesis, and within the song system, its mRNA is specifically increased in males compared to females in the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (LMAN), a region critical for song learning and plasticity. Using in situ hybridization, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry, we observed effects of both age and sex on TBCA mRNA and protein expression. The transcript is increased in males compared to females at three juvenile ages, but not in adults. TBCA protein, both the number of immunoreactive cells and relative concentration in LMAN, is diminished in adults compared to juveniles. The latter was also increased in males compared to females at post-hatching day 25. With double-label immunofluorescence and retrograde tract tracing, we also document that the majority of TBCA+ cells in LMAN are neurons, and that they include robust nucleus of the arcopallium-projecting cells. These results indicate that TBCA is both temporally and spatially primed to facilitate the development of a sexually dimorphic neural pathway critical for song.

AB  - Abstract
Numerous studies have shown that human endogenous retrovirus W family (HERV-W) envelope gene (env) is related to various diseases but the underlying mechanism has remained poorly understood. Our previous study showed that there was abnormal expression of HERV-W env in sera of patients with schizophrenia. In this paper, we reported that overexpression of the HERV-W env elevated the levels of small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel protein 3 (SK3) in human neuroblastoma cells. Using a luciferase reporter system and RNA interference method, we found that functional cAMP response element site was required for the expression of SK3 triggered by HERV-W env. In addition, it was also found that the SK3 channel was activated by HERV-W env. Further study indicated that cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) was required for the activation of the SK3 channel. Thus, a novel signaling mechanism of how HERV-W env influences neuronal activity and contributes to mental illnesses such as schizophrenia was proposed.

AB  - Abstract
Therapeutic strategies for the fatal neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are actually minimally effective on patients’ survival and quality of life. Although stem cell therapy has raised great expectations, information on the involved molecular mechanisms is still limited. Here we assessed the efficacy of the systemic administration of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASC), a previously untested stem cell population, in superoxide-dismutase 1 (SOD1)-mutant transgenic mice, the animal model of familial ALS. The administration of ASC to SOD1-mutant mice at the clinical onset significantly delayed motor deterioration for 4–6 weeks, as shown by clinical and neurophysiological tests. Neuropathological examination of ASC-treated SOD1-mutant mice at day 100 (i.e. the time of their best motor performance) revealed a higher number of lumbar motorneurons than in phosphate-buffered saline-treated SOD1-mutant mice and a restricted number of undifferentiated green fluorescent protein-labeled ASC in the spinal cord. By examining the spinal cord tissue factors that may prolong neuronal survival, we found a significant up-regulation in levels of glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) after ASC treatment. Considering that ASC produce bFGF but not GDNF, these findings indicate that ASC may promote neuroprotection either directly and/or by modulating the secretome of local glial cells toward a neuroprotective phenotype. Such neuroprotection resulted in a strong and long-lasting effect on motor performance and encourages the use of ASC in human pathologies, in which current therapies are not able to maintain a satisfying neurological functional status.

AB  - Abstract
Recent studies indicate that adiponectin can attenuate cerebral ischemic lesions via its functional area located in the C-terminal globular domain, which is called globular adiponectin (gAD). However, the mechanisms underlying this action remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the antioxidant properties of gAD during cerebral ischemia. Adult male C57BL/6 mice received an intracerebral injection of gAD with or without tetrabromocinnamic acid (TBCA, a NADPH oxidase activator). Mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) after gAD injection. Infarct volume, neurological function, the activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase [SOD], catalase), the content of malondialdehyde (MDA), and the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3 and NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) were examined at 24 h after MCAO. Infarct volume was attenuated in gAD-transduced mice when compared with mice in the MCAO group, with significant improvement in neurological function. In addition, neuronal apoptosis was attenuated, along with the expression of Bax/Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase 3. Furthermore, the activities of SOD and catalase increased, and the content of MDA reduced. However, TBCA blocked the effect of gAD on cerebral protection and its antioxidant abilities. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the neuroprotective action of gAD may result from the promotion of antioxidant capacity by inhibiting the NOX2 signaling system.

AB  - Abstract
In the present study we examined the effects of normal aging in the hippocampus and cerebellum, as well as behaviors associated with these substrates. A total of 67 CB6F1 hybrid mice were tested at one of five ages (4, 8, 12, 18 or 25 months) on the context pre-exposure facilitation effect (CPFE) modification of fear conditioning, rotorod, Barnes maze, acoustic startle, Morris water maze (MWM) and 500-ms trace eyeblink classical conditioning (EBCC). Behavioral tasks were chosen to increase the ability to detect age-related changes in learning, as trace EBCC is considered a more difficult paradigm (compared to delay EBCC) and the CPFE has been found to be more sensitive to hippocampus insults than standard contextual fear conditioning. To assess the effects of age on the brain, hippocampus volume was calculated and unbiased stereology was used to estimate the number of Purkinje neurons in the cerebellar cortex. A significant, age-related loss of Purkinje neurons was found—beginning at 12 months of age—and hippocampus volume remained stable over the adult life span. Age-related impairment was found, beginning at 12–18 months in the rotorod, and mice with fewer Purkinje neurons showed greater impairment in this task. CB6F1 mice retained auditory acuity across the life span and mice aged 25 months showed significant age-related impairment in the EBCC task; however, deficits were not associated with the loss of Purkinje neurons. Although the CPFE task is considered more sensitive to hippocampus insult, no age-related impairment was found. Spatial memory retention was impaired in the Barnes maze at 25 months, but no significant deficits were seen in the MWM. These results support the finding of differential aging in the hippocampus and cerebellum.

AB  - Abstract
Selected morphological, molecular and functional aspects of various microglial cell populations were characterized in cell cultures established from the forebrains of E18 rat embryos. The mixed primary cortical cultures were maintained for up to 28 days using routine culturing techniques when the microglial cells in the culture were not stimulated or immunologically challenged. During culturing, expansion of the microglial cell populations was observed, as evidenced by quantitative assessment of selected monocyte/macrophage/microglial cell-specific markers (human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DP, DQ, DR, CD11b/c and Iba1) via immunocyto- and histochemistry and Western blot analysis. The Iba1 immunoreactivity in Western blots steadily increased about 750-fold, and the number of Iba1-immunoreactive cells rose at least 67-fold between one day in vitro (DIV1) and DIV28. Morphometric analysis on binary (digital) silhouettes of the microglia revealed their evolving morphology during culturing. Microglial cells were mainly ameboid in the early stages of in vitro differentiation, while mixed populations of ameboid and ramified cell morphologies were characteristic of older cultures as the average transformation index (TI) increased from 1.96 (DIV1) to 15.17 (DIV28). Multiple immunofluorescence labeling of selected biomarkers revealed different microglial phenotypes during culturing. For example, while HLA DP, DQ, DR immunoreactivity was present exclusively in ameboid microglia (TI &lt; 3) between DIV1 and DIV10, CD11b/c- and Iba1-positive microglial cells were moderately (TI &lt; 13) and progressively (TI &lt; 81) more ramified, respectively, and always present throughout culturing. Regardless of the age of the cultures, proliferating microglia were Ki67-positive and characterized by low TI values (TI &lt; 3). The microglial function was assessed by an in vitro phagocytosis assay. Unstimulated microglia with low TI values were significantly more active in phagocytosing fluorescent microspheres than the ramified forms. In vitro studies on microglial population dynamics combined with phenotypic characterization can be of importance when different in vivo pathophysiological situations are modeled in vitro.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic exposure to opiates leads to maladaptive changes in various functions of the mammalian brain, including properties of neuronal response in the visual pathway. In the present study, we used multibarreled microelectrodes to study the effects of electrophoretic application of GABA or the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline on the properties of individual V1 neurons in cats which were chronically treated with morphine (MTCs) or saline (STCs). The results showed that the application of either GABA or bicuculline significantly altered spontaneous activity as well as orientation selectivity and signal-to-noise ratios of visually evoked responses in both MTCs and STCs. While administration of bicuculline exerted a much stronger effect on neuronal responses of V1 neurons of the STCs, administration of GABA resulted in improved visual function mainly in MTCs. Most importantly, GABA-treated cells in area V1 of the MTCs displayed similar responses to those in STCs. These results are consistent with the idea that: (1) there is a decrease in GABA-mediated inhibition in area V1 of cats exposed chronically to morphine, and (2) this decrease contributes strongly to the apparent degradation of neuronal function observed in animals exposed chronically to morphine.

AB  - Abstract
The opiate system has long been implicated in the rewarding properties of social interactions. In particular, the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) mediates multiple forms of social attachment, including the attachment of offspring to the mother and social bonding between mates. We have previously shown that MOR in the caudate-putamen is involved in partner preference formation in monogamous prairie voles. Here, using in situ hybridization and receptor autoradiography, we mapped in detail the distribution of MOR mRNA and ligand binding in monogamous prairie vole brains and compared MOR binding density with that of promiscuous meadow vole brains. Comparison of MOR binding in these closely related species with distinctly different social behavior revealed that while the distribution of MOR is similar, prairie voles have significantly higher densities of MOR than meadow voles in a majority of regions in the forebrain, including the caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens shell, lateral septum and several thalamic nuclei, including the anteroventral and anteromedial thalamic nuclei. These differences in MOR expression between prairie and meadow voles could potentially contribute to species differences in behavior, including social attachment.

AB  - Abstract
Relay cells of dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) receive a Class 1 glutamatergic input from the retina and a Class 2 input from cortical layer 6. Among the properties of Class 2 synapses is the ability to activate metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), and mGluR activation is known to affect thalamocortical transmission via regulating retinogeniculate and thalamocortical synapses. Using brain slices, we studied the effects of Group I (dihydroxyphenylglycine) and Group II ((2S,2′R,3′R)-2-(2′,3′-dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine) mGluR agonists on retinogeniculate synapses. We showed that both agonists inhibit retinogeniculate excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) through presynaptic mechanisms, and their effects are additive and independent. We also found high-frequency stimulation of the layer 6 corticothalamic input produced a similar suppression of retinogeniculate EPSCs, suggesting layer 6 projection to LGN as a plausible source of activating these presynaptic mGluRs.

AB  - Recent functional imaging studies that examined functional connectivity in the resting brain have demonstrated various intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs). Certain patterns of over- and underactivity in various ICNs have been hypothesized to form the neural basis of psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, activity in the ICNs does not reflect ongoing mental activity but the maintenance of neural circuits in a ready state suggesting not only relationships between ICNs and disorders but also correlations between ICNs and personality. In the present study, we assess the relationship between trait anxiety, a well established endophenotype of anxiety disorders, and functional connectivities within the insular salience ICN in a sample of healthy female subjects. Based on a previous study that demonstrated the functional relevance of the insular salience ICN for state anxiety, we used the harm avoidance scale from the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) as a trait marker to demonstrate increased functional connectivity within the insular salience ICN. Specifically, the functional connectivity between the anterior insula and the anterior cingulate and between the anterior insula and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were positively correlated with individual harm avoidance scores. The results fit into previous work, provide evidence for a potential biomarker of anxiety disorders and, most importantly, demonstrate a direct neural correlate of the personality trait harm avoidance in the absence of external stimulation.

AB  - Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8), a neuropeptide, plays an important role in morphine dependence and several addictive behaviors. We have previously reported that CCK-8 attenuates the acquisition of morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP), but the possible functions of CCK-8 on drug relapse remain unclear. Here we evaluated the effects of CCK-8 on the reinstatement of extinguished morphine-induced CPP and behavioral sensitization. A single injection of 0.1 and 1 μg CCK-8 (i.c.v.) significantly attenuated both drug- (morphine) and stress- (foot shock) primed reinstatement of CPP and reduced the escalated locomotor activity in reinstatement tests. Additionally, CCK-8 blocked the expression of morphine-induced behavioral sensitization. However, administration of CCK-8 (0.01, 0.1 and 1 μg) alone to morphine-pretreated rats could not trigger reinstatement of CPP and had no significant effect on threshold sensitivity to foot shock. In conclusion, our study identifies a distinct inhibitory effect of CCK-8 on the reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior and provides a potential application to the medication of drug relapse.

AB  - Abstract
People with Parkinson’s disease (PD) perceive that their movement amplitude is greater than what they actually perform. The neural mechanisms underlying one’s perception of movement are believed to involve the sensorimotor integration process (SIP). How PD affects the SIP is not well understood. A previous study interrogating the SIP showed healthy adults (HAs) overestimated their limb position in the direction of movement and the error and its variance (VOE) depended on movement duration. We asked if PDs showed errors in perceived limb position and if the dependence on movement duration was different from HAs. We used an existing computational model of the SIP to explore mechanisms for the error and VOE as a function of movement duration. Twenty PDs, off medication, and 20 age-matched HAs were asked to estimate the position of their hand after performing 50, slow, non-visually guided wrist flexion or extension movements for a random period of time (&lt;4.0 s). Both groups overestimated the amount they moved; however, the PDs’ error and VOE were larger (p &lt; 0.001). HAs showed increasing error/VOE for small movement durations that reduced/stabilized for longer movement durations. PDs however showed increasing error/VOE with increasing movement duration that did not significantly improve/stabilize. The model suggested that the basis for such perceptual deficits may be abnormal proprioceptive feedback and/or processing of an abnormal internal impression (prediction) that underestimates movement amplitude. Simulation results imply that the PD’s SIP could no longer effectively access sensory (proprioceptive) feedback to correct errors in other components of the SIP due to the abnormal processing of sensory feedback. We suggest from this study that an impaired perception of movement amplitude and sensory processing deficits contribute to hypokinesia in PD.

AB  - Abstract
Anxiety disorders are associated with abnormalities in the neural processing of threat-related stimuli. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying threat bias in anxiety are not well understood. We recently reported that a Prkar1a heterozygote (Prkar1a+/−) mouse with haploinsufficiency for the main regulatory subunit (R1α) of protein kinase A (PKA) exhibits an anxiety-like phenotype associated with increased cAMP signaling in the amygdala. Prkar1a+/− mice provide a novel model to test the direct effect of altered PKA expression and subsequent anxiety-like behavioral phenotype on the response to threat. We hypothesized that Prkar1a+/−mice would exhibit a bias in threat detection since increased amygdala activity during emotional stimuli is associated with a maladaptive response. We measured behavior and PKA activity in brain areas after exposure to predator or control odor exposure in male Prkar1a+/− and wild-type (WT) littermates. Indeed, there were significant differences in the behavioral response to threat detection; WT mice showed the expected response of decrease in exploratory behavior during predator vs. control odor exposure, while Prkar1a+/− mice did not alter their behavior between conditions. Basal and total PKA activity was independently associated with genotype, with an interaction between genotype and threat condition. Prkar1a+/− mice had higher PKA activity in amygdala and ventromedial hypothalamus in response to predator odor. In contrast, WT mice had higher PKA activity in amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex after exposure to control odor.

Dysregulated PKA activity in the amygdala–prefrontal cortex circuitry in Prkar1a+/− mice is associated with behavioral phenotype of anxiety and a bias for threat. This is likely related to a failure to inhibit the amydgala response, which is an effect of the genotype. These results suggest that the alteration in PKA signaling in Prkar1a+/− mice is not ubiquitous in the brain; tissue-specific effects of the cAMP/PKA pathway are related to threat detection and fear sensitization.

AB  - AbstractBackground
Ischemic postconditioning (IPostC) has been shown to attenuate brain injury in rat stroke models, but a mouse model has not been reported. This study establishes an IPostC model in mice and investigates how IPostC affects infiltration of leukocytes in the ischemic brain and lymphopenia associated with stroke-induced immunodepression.
Material and methods
A total of 125 mice were used. IPostC was performed by a repeated series of brief occlusions of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) after reperfusion, in a focal ischemia model in mice. Infarct sizes, neurological scores, inflammatory brain cells and immune cell populations in lymph nodes, spleen and bone marrow were analyzed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).
Results
IPostC performed immediately, 2 min and 3 h after reperfusion significantly reduced infarct sizes and attenuated neurological scores as measured up to 3 days post-stroke. In the group with strongest protection, infarct sizes were reduced from 49.6 ± 2.8% (n = 16) to 27.9 ± 2.9% (n = 10, P &lt; .001). The spared infarct areas were seen in the ischemic penumbra or ischemic margins, i.e., the border zones between the cortical territories of the anterior cerebral artery and those of the MCA, as well as in the ventromedial and dorsolateral striata. FACS analyses showed that IPostC significantly blocked increases in the numbers of microglia (CD45intCD11b+), macrophages (CD45hiCD68+), CD4 T cells (CD45+CD4+) and CD8 T cells (CD45+CD8+) as well as B lymphocytes (CD45+CD19+) in the ischemic brain (n = 5/group). Reduced-immune cell numbers in the peripheral blood and spleen were increased by IPostC while immune cell populations in the bone marrow were not altered by IPostC.
Conclusions
IPostC reduced brain infarction and mitigated neurological deficits in mice, likely by blocking infiltration of both innate and adaptive immune cells in the ischemic brain. In addition, IPostC robustly attenuated peripheral lymphopenia and thus improved systemic immunodepression.

AB  - Abstract
Glutamate plays a central role in brain physiology and pathology. The involvement of excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) in neurodegenerative disorders including acute stroke has been widely studied, but little is known about the role of glial glutamate transporters in white matter injury after chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. The present study evaluated the expression of glial (EAAT1 and EAAT2) and neuronal (EAAT3) glutamate transporters in subcortical white matter and cortex, before and 3–28 days after the ligation of bilateral common carotid arteries (LBCCA) in rat brain. K-B staining showed a gradual increase of demyelination in white matter after ischemia, while there was no cortical involvement. Between 3 and 7 days after LBCCA, a significant increase in EAAT2 protein levels was observed in the ischemic brain and the number of EAAT2-positive cells also significantly increased both in the cortical and white matter lesions. EAAT2 was detected in glial-fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes in both the cortex and white matter, but not in neuronal and oligodendroglial cells. EAAT1 was slightly elevated after ischemia only in the white matter, but EAAT3 was at almost similar levels both in the cortex and white matter after ischemia. A significant increase in EAAT2 expression level was also noted in the deep white matter of chronic human ischemic brain tissue compared to the control group. Our findings suggest important roles for up-regulated EAAT2 in chronic brain ischemia especially in the regulation of high-affinity of extracellular glutamate and minimization of white matter damage.

AB  - Abstract
Mitochondrial fission has been reported to be involved in oxidative stress, apoptosis and many neurological diseases. However, the role of mitochondrial fission in seizures, which could induce oxidative stress and neuronal loss, remains unknown. In this study, we used pilocarpine to elicit seizures in rats. Meanwhile, we used mitochondrial division inhibitor 1 (mdivi-1), a selective inhibitor of mitochondrial fission protein dynamin-related protein1 (Drp1), to suppress mitochondrial fission in epileptic model of rats in vivo. We found that mitochondrial fission was increased after seizures and the inhibition of mitochondrial fission by mdivi-1 significantly attenuated oxidative stress and reduced neuronal loss after seizures, shown by the decreased 8-hydroxy deoxyguanosine (8-oHdG) content, the increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, the reduced expression of cytochrome c and caspase3 and the increased surviving neurons in the hippocampus. These results indicated that mitochondrial fission is up-regulated after seizures and the inhibition of mitochondrial fission is protective against neuronal injury in seizures, the underlying mechanism may be through the mitochondria/reactive oxygen species (ROS)/cytochrome c pathway.

AB  - Abstract
Based on two-photon calcium imaging, Histed et al. (2009) concluded that electrical microstimulation of cortical tissue in mammals activates a sparse and distributed population of neurons. This work has been cited by many as proof that electrical microstimulation is nonfocal, which means it may lack the precision needed for applications in neuroprosthetics. We affirm that the generation of stimulation-evoked behaviour is based primarily on the orthodromic conduction of signals originating mainly from the deepest layers of cortex, while the work of Histed et al. is effectively limited to investigating the antidromic activation of lateral projection neurons of the superficial cortex. The apparent sparse activation is a consequence of the pattern of axonal projections based on activating a volume of axons while imaging cell bodies transecting a single plane through the cortex. This creates the false impression that the distribution of activated neurons is sparse and nonfocal. We recommend how two-photon calcium imaging, which is superb for the study of individual and groups of neurons, might be more effectively used to ascertain how electrical stimulation affects the brains of mammals. This is a timely topic since investigators are using electrical microstimulation in animals to develop prosthetic devices to restore sensory and motor functions in disabled patients.

AB  - Abstract
The somatic marker hypothesis asserts that decision-making can be guided by feedback of bodily states to the brain. In line with this hypothesis, the present study tested whether sympathetic activity shows an association with a tonic dimension of decision-making, exploratory tendency represented by entropy in information theory, and further examined the neural mechanisms of the association. Twenty participants performed a stochastic reversal learning task that required decision-making in an unstable and uncertain situation. Regional cerebral blood flow was evaluated using 15O-water positron emission tomography (PET), and cardiovascular indices and concentrations of catecholamine in peripheral blood were also measured, during the task. In reversal learning, increased epinephrine during the task positively correlated with larger entropy, indicating a greater tendency for exploration in decision-making. The increase of epinephrine also correlated with brain activity revealed by PET in the somatosensory cortices, anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and the dorsal pons. This result is consistent with previously reported brain matrixes of representation of bodily states and interoception. In addition, activity of the anterior insula specifically correlated with entropy, suggesting possible mediation of this brain region between peripheral sympathetic arousal and exploration in decision-making. These findings shed a new light about a role of bodily states in decision-making and underlying neural mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract
Although hippocampal sclerosis is frequently identified as a possible epileptic focus in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, neuronal loss has also been observed in additional structures, including areas outside the temporal lobe. The claim from several researchers using animal models of acquired epilepsy that the immature brain can develop epilepsy without evidence of hippocampal neuronal death raises the possibility that neuronal death in some of these other regions may also be important for epileptogenesis. The present study used the lithium pilocarpine model of acquired epilepsy in immature animals to assess which structures outside the hippocampus are injured acutely after status epilepticus. Sprague–Dawley rat pups were implanted with surface EEG electrodes, and status epilepticus was induced at 20 days of age with lithium pilocarpine. After 72 h, brain tissue from 12 animals was examined with Fluoro-Jade B, a histochemical marker for degenerating neurons. All animals that had confirmed status epilepticus demonstrated Fluoro-Jade B staining in areas outside the hippocampus. The most prominent staining was seen in the thalamus (mediodorsal, paratenial, reuniens, and ventral lateral geniculate nuclei), amygdala (ventral lateral, posteromedial, and basomedial nuclei), ventral premammillary nuclei of hypothalamus, and paralimbic cortices (perirhinal, entorhinal, and piriform) as well as parasubiculum and dorsal endopiriform nuclei. These results demonstrate that lithium pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in the immature rat brain consistently results in neuronal injury in several distinct areas outside of the hippocampus. Many of these regions are similar to areas damaged in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, thus suggesting a possible role in epileptogenesis.

AB  - Abstract
Distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSP) with associated neuropathic pain is the most common neurological disorder affecting patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). Viral protein R (Vpr) is a neurotoxic protein encoded by HIV-1 and secreted by infected macrophages. Vpr reduces neuronal viability, increases cytosolic calcium and membrane excitability of cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons, and is associated with mechanical allodynia in vivo. A clinical trial with HIV/AIDS patients demonstrated that nerve growth factor (NGF) reduced the severity of DSP-associated neuropathic pain, a problem linked to damage to small diameter, potentially NGF-responsive fibers. Herein, the actions of NGF were investigated in our Vpr model of DSP and we demonstrated that NGF significantly protected sensory neurons from the effects of Vpr. Footpads of immunodeficient Vpr transgenic (vpr/RAG1−/−) mice displayed allodynia (p &lt; 0.05), diminished epidermalinnervation (p &lt; 0.01) and reduced NGF mRNA expression (p &lt; 0.001) compared to immunodeficient (wildtype/RAG1−/−) littermate control mice. Compartmented cultures confirmed recombinant Vpr exposure to the DRG neuronal perikarya decreased distal neurite extension (p &lt; 0.01), whereas NGF exposure at these distal axons protected the DRG neurons from the Vpr-induced effect on their cell bodies. NGF prevented Vpr-induced attenuation of the phosphorylated glycogen synthase-3 axon extension pathway and tropomyosin-related kinase A (TrkA) receptor expression in DRG neurons (p &lt; 0.05) and it directly counteracted the cytosolic calcium burst caused by Vpr exposure to DRG neurons (p &lt; 0.01). TrkA receptor agonist indicated that NGFacted through the TrkA receptor to block the Vpr-mediated decrease in axon outgrowth in neonatal and adult rat and fetal human DRG neurons (p &lt; 0.05). Similarly, inhibiting the lower affinity NGF receptor, p75, blocked Vpr’s effect on DRG neurons. Overall, NGF/TrkA signaling or p75 receptor inhibition protects somatic sensory neurons exposed to Vpr, thus laying the groundwork for potential therapeutic options for HIV/AIDS patients suffering from DSP.

AB  - Abstract
Regular exercise promotes brain function via a wide range of adaptive responses, including the increased expression of antioxidant and oxidative DNA damage-repairing systems. Accumulation of oxidized DNA base lesions and strand breaks is etiologically linked to for example aging processes and age-associated diseases. Here we tested whether exercise training has an impact on brain function, extent of neurogenesis, and expression of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase-1 (Ogg1) and SIRT1 (silent mating-type information regulation 2 homolog). To do so, we utilized strains of rats with low- and high-running capacity (LCR and HCR) and examined learning and memory, DNA synthesis, expression, and post-translational modification of Ogg1 hippocampal cells. Our results showed that rats with higher aerobic/running capacity had better spatial memory, and expressed less Ogg1, when compared to LCR rats. Furthermore, exercise increased SIRT1 expression and decreased acetylated Ogg1 (AcOgg1) levels, a post-translational modification important for efficient repair of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG). Our data on cell cultures revealed that nicotinamide, a SIRT1-specific inhibitor, caused the greatest increase in the acetylation of Ogg1, a finding further supported by our other observations that silencing SIRT1 also markedly increased the levels of AcOgg1. These findings imply that high-running capacity is associated with increased hippocampal function, and SIRT1 level/activity and inversely correlates with AcOgg1 levels and thereby the repair of genomic 8-oxoG.

AB  - Abstract
Experiments were done to investigate whether hypothalamic hypocretin-1 (hcrt-1; orexin-A) neurons that sent axonal projections to cardiovascular responsive sites in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) co-expressed leucine-enkephalin (L-Enk), and to determine the effects of co-administration of hcrt-1 and D-Ala2,D-Leu5-Enkephalin (DADL) into NTS on mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate. In the first series, in the Wistar rat the retrograde tract-tracer fluorogold (FG) was microinjected (50 nl) into caudal NTS sites at which l-glutamate (0.25 M; 10 nl) elicited decreases in MAP and where fibers hcrt-1 immunoreactive fibers were observed that also contained L-Enk immunoreactivity. Of the number of hypothalamic hcrt-1 immunoreactive neurons identified ipsilateral to the NTS injection site (1207 ± 78), 32.3 ± 2.3% co-expressed L-Enk immunoreactivity and of these, 2.6 ± 1.1% were retrogradely labeled with FG. Hcrt-1/L-Enk neurons projecting to NTS were found mainly within the perifornical region. In the second series, the region of caudal NTS found to contain axons that co-expressed hcrt-1 and L-Enk immunoreactivity was microinjected with a combination of hcrt-1 and DADL in α-chloralose anesthetized Wistar rats. Microinjection of DADL into NTS elicited depressor and bradycardia responses similar to those elicited by microinjection of hcrt-1. An hcrt-1 injection immediately after the DADL injection elicited an almost twofold increase in the magnitude of the depressor and bradycardia responses compared to those elicited by hcrt-1 alone. Prior injections of the non-specific opioid receptor antagonist naloxone or the specific opioid δ-receptor antagonist ICI 154,129 significantly attenuated the cardiovascular responses to the combined hcrt-1-DADL injections. Taken together, these data suggest that activation of hypothalamic-opioidergic neuronal systems contribute to the NTS hcrt-1 induced cardiovascular responses, and that this descending hypothalamo-medullary pathway may represent the anatomical substrate by which hcrt-1/L-Enk neurons function in the coordination of autonomic-cardiovascular responses during different behavioral states.

AB  - Abstract
Experimental studies show that inflammation reduces the regenerative capacity in the adult brain. Less is known about how early postnatal inflammation affects neurogenesis, stem cell proliferation, cell survival and learning and memory in young adulthood. In this study we examined if an early-life inflammatory challenge alters cell proliferation and survival in distinct anatomical regions of the hippocampus and whether learning and memory were affected. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 mg/kg) was administered to mice on postnatal day (P) 9 and proliferation and survival of hippocampal cells born either prior to (24 h before LPS), or during the inflammatory insult (48 h after LPS) was evaluated. Long-term cell survival of neurons and astrocytes was determined on P 41 and P 60 in the dorsal and ventral horns of the hippocampus. On day 50 the mice were tested in the trace fear conditioning (TFC) paradigm. There was no effect on the survival of neurons and astrocytes that were born before LPS injection. In contrast, the number of neurons and astrocytes that were born after LPS injection were reduced on P 41. The LPS-induced reduction in cell numbers was specific for the dorsal hippocampus. Neither early (48 h after LPS) or late (33 days after LPS) proliferation of cells was affected by neonatal inflammation and neonatal LPS did not alter the behavior of young adult mice in the TFC test. These data highlight that neonatal inflammation specifically affects survival of dividing neurons and astrocytes, but not post-mitotic cells. The reduction in cell survival could be attributed to less cell survival in the dorsal hippocampus, but had no effect on learning and memory in the young adult.

AB  - Abstract
Speech comprehension relies on auditory as well as visual information, and is enhanced in healthy subjects, when audiovisual (AV) information is present. Patients with schizophrenia have been reported to have problems regarding this AV integration process, but little is known about which underlying neural processes are altered. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 15 schizophrenia patients (SP) and 15 healthy controls (HC) to study functional connectivity of Broca’s area by means of a beta series correlation method during perception of audiovisually presented bisyllabic German nouns, in which audio and video either matched or did not match. Broca’s area of SP showed stronger connectivity with supplementary motor cortex for incongruent trials whereas HC connectivity was stronger for congruent trials. The right posterior superior temporal sulcus (RpSTS) area showed differences in connectivity for congruent and incongruent trials in HC in contrast to SP where the connectivity was similar for both conditions. These smaller differences in connectivity in SP suggest a less adaptive processing of audiovisually congruent and incongruent speech. The findings imply that AV integration problems in schizophrenia are associated with maladaptive connectivity of Broca’s and RpSTS area in particular when confronted with incongruent stimuli. Results are discussed in light of recent AV speech perception models.

KW  - glycine transporter type 2
AB  - AbstractBackground
Strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors are activated by glycine and facilitate chloride influx into neurons. Glycinergic transmission might be either mediated by synaptic or extrasynaptic glycine receptors. While phasic neurotransmission is provided by a synaptic pathway, activation of extrasynaptic glycine receptors induces tonic inhibition. The glycine transporter 2 (GlyT2) regulates the uptake of glycine into presynaptic boutons. It is not determined yet, whether inhibition of GlyT2 by ALX 1393 can produce inhibition of spinal motoric networks and, whether phasic or tonic glycinergic inhibition is mostly enhanced.
Methods
We investigated the effect of ALX 1393 on spontaneous action potential firing activity by extracellular recordings in the ventral horn area of organotypic spinal cultures. Additionally, using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique, we defined the influence of GlyT2 inhibition on tonic and phasic glycinergic transmission in commissural interneurons of the ventral horn.
Results
GlyT2 inhibition by ALX 1393 potently reduced neuronal action potential activity in a concentration-dependent manner (n = 211). The half maximal effect of ALX 1393 was observed at 100 ± 31 nM. Moreover, 88.3 ± 2.6% of the action potential activity was suppressed at 1 μM. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings unveiled that ALX 1393 (200 nM) induced a tonic current (−45.7 ± 11.6 pA, n = 5) that was significantly reversed by application of the competitive glycine receptor antagonist strychnine. Contrastingly, phasic glycinergic transmission was not augmented by GlyT2 inhibition (charge transferred per time period for control conditions: 1.1 ± 0.1 pC, n = 7, for ALX 1393: 0.9 ± 0.2 pC, n = 7, p &gt; 0.05).
Conclusion
GlyT2 inhibition induced glycinergic tonic currents, which might be the underlying mechanism for the observed suppression of spontaneous action potential activity by ALX 1393 in the spinal ventral horn. Silencing neuronal action potential activity by blocking GlyT2 might be a novel principle to inhibit locomotor circuits in the ventral horn area and to induce muscle relaxation.

Electromagnetic field (EMF) radiations emitted from mobile phones may cause structural damage to neurons. With the increased usage of mobile phones worldwide, concerns about their possible effects on the nervous system are rising. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the possible effects of prenatal EMF exposure on the cerebellum of offspring Wistar rats. Rats in the EMF group were exposed to 900-MHz pulse-EMF irradiation for 6 h per day during all gestation period. Ten offspring per each group were evaluated for behavioral and electrophysiological evaluations. Cerebellum-related behavioral dysfunctions were analyzed using motor learning and cerebellum-dependent functional tasks (Accelerated Rotarod, Hanging and Open field tests). Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were used for electrophysiological evaluations. The results of the present study failed to show any behavioral abnormalities in rats exposed to chronic EMF radiation. However, whole-cell patch clamp recordings revealed decreased neuronal excitability of Purkinje cells in rats exposed to EMF. The most prominent changes included afterhyperpolarization amplitude, spike frequency, half width and first spike latency. In conclusion, the results of the present study show that prenatal EMF exposure results in altered electrophysiological properties of Purkinje neurons. However, these changes may not be severe enough to alter the cerebellum-dependent functional tasks.

AB  - Abstract
Hypoxic insults during the perinatal period lead to motor and cognitive impairments that later appear during childhood. In the adult brain, hypoxic events often lead to necrotic neuronal death, depending on the region and intensity of the event. During development an active apoptotic cell death occurs and could be an important variable affecting the hypoxic insult outcome.

In the present work we performed a comparative study, in a chick embryo model, of the phenotypes and molecular markers exhibited during developmental and hypoxic cell death (HxCD). Ultrastructural analysis of optic tectum cells of embryos subjected to hypoxia (8% O2, 60 min) revealed a clear apoptotic morphology that did not differ from the one exhibited during developmental cell death. Integrity of plasma membrane, condensation of chromatin in round well-defined bodies, and gradual shrinkage of the cell are all hallmarks of the apoptotic process and were present in both control and hypoxic cells. To elucidate if hypoxic and developmental cell deaths share a common mechanism we evaluated the activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. A basal cleavage of caspase-9 and cytochrome c release was observed by co-immunofluorescence in control embryos, but hypoxic insult significantly increased the incidence of this colocalization. Caspase-8 cleavage remained unchanged after the hypoxic insult, suggesting that the extrinsic pathway would not be involved in hypoxic death. We also observed a significant decrease of Akt activation immediately after hypoxia, possibly facilitating the later release of cytochrome c. In addition we analyzed the influence of retinal ganglion cells (RGC) in neuronal survival. Transection of RGC fibers at embryonic day (ED) 3 did not induce any change in developmental and HxCD at ED12. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that a hypoxic insult in the developing brain triggers the same apoptotic pathway as the active developmental death.

AB  - Abstract
The goal of the present study was to establish the behavioral role of the nucleus accumbens (Nacc) core in the feed-forward spiraling striato-nigro-striatal circuitry that transmits information from the Nacc shell toward the dorsal subregion of the neostriatum (DS) in freely moving rats. Unilateral injection of μ-opioid receptor agonist [D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO; 1 and 2 μg), but not the δ1-opioid receptor agonist [D-Pen2,5]-enkephalin (4 μg) or the δ2-opioid receptor agonist [D-Ala2,Glu4]-deltorphin (2 μg), into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) produced contraversive circling in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of DAMGO was μ-opioid receptor-specific, because the μ-opioid receptor antagonist D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn-Thr-Phe-Thr-NH2 (0.1 and 1 μg), which alone did not elicit any turning behavior, dose-dependently inhibited the effect of DAMGO. Injection of the dopamine D1/D2 receptor antagonist cis-(Z)-flupentixol (1 and 10 μg) into the Nacc shell ipsilaterally to the VTA significantly inhibited DAMGO (2 μg)-induced circling. Similar injections of cis-(Z)-flupentixol into the Nacc core inhibited DAMGO-induced circling, but, in addition, replaced circling by pivoting, namely turning behavior during which the rat rotates around its disfunctioning hindlimb. The present findings show that unilateral stimulation of μ-, but not δ-, opioid receptors in the VTA elicits contraversive circling that requires a relatively hyperdopaminergic activity in both the shell and the core of the Nacc at the opioid-stimulated side of the brain. The Nacc core plays an essential role in the transmission of information directing the display of pivoting that is elicited by an increased dopaminergic activity in the Nacc shell. It is concluded that the Nacc core is an essential link in the feed-forward spiraling striato-nigro-striatal circuitry that transmits information from the Nacc shell toward the DS in freely moving rats.

AB  - Abstract
Prolonged and repeated periods of maternal separation produce behavioral phenotype of increased vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders and drug abuse. Most of the changes in behavior, corticosterone (CORT) and monoamine levels induced by long maternal separation (LMS) are observed after a challenge, but not in basal conditions. LMS increases ethanol-induced locomotor response and self-administration, possibly due to changes in CORT release and/or monoamine concentrations. This study examined the effects of LMS in association with chronic ethanol treatment on plasma CORT and brain monoamine concentrations in male and female Swiss mice, which were kept undisturbed (animal facility rearing – AFR) or separated from their mothers for 3 h/day, from 2 to 14 days of age (LMS). As adults, one set of male and female mice received no drug treatment to assess the effect of LMS per se. Another set of animals received saline injections for 20 days and one ethanol injection (2.2 g/kg, i.p.) on day 21 (acute) or ethanol for 21 days (chronic). Locomotor activity, plasma CORT levels and monoamines in the frontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus of AFR and LMS mice were evaluated in non-treated, acute and chronic ethanol-treated animals. In non-treated mice, no differences were found in CORT or locomotor activity, with small changes in monoamines content. In LMS females, chronic ethanol increased dopamine and serotonin concentrations in the frontal cortex, relative to acute ethanol LMS and to chronic ethanol-treated AFR groups (p &lt; 0.05). In LMS males, chronic ethanol increased hippocampal noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin and metabolites when compared to respective AFR controls, as well as acute LMS. Moreover, chronic ethanol treatment resulted in higher CORT concentrations in LMS than in AFR males. Overall, these results indicate that LMS mice were more susceptible to the effects of chronic ethanol administration on CORT and brain monoamine concentrations, and that these effects were sex-dependent.

AB  - Abstract
Phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ) is a shared downstream component of chemokine-mediated signaling pathways and regulates migration, proliferation and activation of inflammatory cells. PI3Kγ has been shown to play a crucial role in regulating inflammatory responses during the progression of several diseases. We investigated the potential function of PI3Kγ in mediating inflammatory reactions and the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis (MS). We found that systemic treatment with selective PI3Kγ inhibitor AS-604850 significantly reduced the number of infiltrated leukocytes in the CNS and ameliorated the clinical symptoms of EAE mice. Treatment with this PI3Kγ inhibitor enhanced myelination and axon number in the spinal cord of EAE mice. Consistently, we demonstrated that PI3Kγ deletion in knockout mice mitigates the clinical sign of EAE compared to PI3Kγ+/+ controls. PI3Kγ deletion increased the number of axons in the lumbar spinal cord, including descending 5-HT-positive serotonergic fiber tracts. Our results indicate that PI3Kγ contributes to development of autoimmune CNS inflammation and that PI3Kγ blockade may provide a great potential for treating patients with MS.

AB  - Abstract
Neurotransmitter release probability is related by high power to the local concentration of calcium in presynaptic terminals, which in turn is controlled by voltage-gated calcium channels. P/Q- and N-type channels trigger synaptic transmission in the majority of neurons of the central nervous system. However, whether and under which conditions both channel types act cooperatively or independently is still insufficiently understood. Previous studies suggested either a dominance of N- or P/Q-type channels, or a synergistic action of both channels, depending on the experimental paradigms. Thus, to provide insight into the properties of neurotransmitter release in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons, we used quantitative analysis of FM dye release from presynaptic boutons induced by high potassium membrane depolarization. Increasing extracellular potassium concentrations revealed a sigmoid dependence of FM dye release to the stimulation strength. Individual and combined application of the P/Q- and N-type channel-specific blockers ω-agatoxin-IVA and ω-conotoxin-GVIA, respectively, allowed us to specifically isolate the contribution of both channel types to release triggered with 40 mM KCl. Analysis of the release kinetics and the fractional release amplitude demonstrate that, whereas in only 15% of the synapses release depended exclusively on P/Q-type channels, the majority of synapses (85%) contained both N- and P/Q-type channels. Nevertheless, the kinetics of FM dye release in synapses containing both channel types was determined by the P/Q-type channels. Together, our data suggest a more direct coupling of P/Q-type channels to synaptic release compared to N-type channels, which may explain the high prevalence of neurological P/Q-type channelopathies.

AB  - Abstract
Diabetic retinopathy is one of the most frequent causes of blindness in adults in the Western countries. Although diabetic retinopathy is considered a vascular disease, several reports demonstrate that retinal neurons are also affected, leading to vision loss.

Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), an endogenous bile acid, has proven to be neuroprotective in several models of neurodegenerative diseases, including models of retinal degeneration.

Since hyperglycemia is considered to play a central role in retinal cell dysfunction and degeneration, underlying the progression of diabetic retinopathy, the purpose of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of TUDCA in rat retinal neurons exposed to elevated glucose concentration.

We found that TUDCA markedly decreased cell death in cultured retinal neural cells induced by exposure to elevated glucose concentration. In addition, TUDCA partially prevented the release of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondria, as well as the subsequent accumulation of AIF in the nucleus. Biomarkers of oxidative stress, such as protein carbonyl groups and reactive oxygen species production, were markedly decreased after TUDCA treatment as compared to cells exposed to elevated glucose concentration alone.

In conclusion, TUDCA protected retinal neural cell cultures from cell death induced by elevated glucose concentration, decreasing mito-nuclear translocation of AIF. The antioxidant properties of TUDCA might explain its cytoprotection. These findings may have relevance in the treatment of diabetic retinopathy patients.

AB  - Abstract
Alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChRs) mediate nicotine-induced burst-firing of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a limbic brain region critically involved in reward and in dopamine D2 receptor (D2R)-related cortical dysfunctions associated with psychosis. The known presence of α7nAChRs and Gi-coupled D2Rs in dopamine neurons of the VTA suggests that these receptors are targeted to at least some of the same neurons in this brain region. To test this hypothesis, we used electron microscopic immunolabeling of antisera against peptide sequences of α7nACh and D2 receptors in the mouse VTA. Dual D2R and α7nAChR labeling was seen in many of the same somata (co-localization over 97%) and dendrites (co-localization over 49%), where immunoreactivity for each of the receptors was localized to endomembranes as well as to non-synaptic or synaptic plasma membranes often near excitatory-type synapses. In comparison with somata and dendrites, many more small axons and axon terminals were separately labeled for each of the receptors. Thus, single-labeled axon terminals were predominant for both α7nAChR (57.9%) and D2R (89.0%). The majority of the immunolabeled axonal profiles contained D2R-immunoreactivity (81.6%) and formed either symmetric or asymmetric synapses consistent with involvement in the release of both inhibitory and excitatory transmitters. Of 160 D2R-labeled terminals, 81.2% were presynaptic to dendrites that expressed α7nAChR alone or together with the D2R. Numerous glial processes inclusive of those enveloping either excitatory- or inhibitory-type synapses also contained single labeling for D2R (n = 152) and α7nAChR (n = 561). These results suggest that classic antipsychotic drugs, all of which block the D2R, may facilitate α7nAChR-mediated burst-firing by elimination of D2R-dependent inhibition in neurons expressing both receptors as well as by indirect pre-synaptic and glial mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract
Autism is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction, deficits in verbal and non-verbal communication, and repetitive behavior and restricted interests. Emerging evidence suggests that aberrant neuroimmune responses may contribute to phenotypic deficits and could be appropriate targets for pharmacologic intervention. Interleukin (IL)-6, one of the most important neuroimmune factors, has been shown to be involved in physiological brain development and in several neurological disorders. For instance, findings from postmortem and animal studies suggest that brain IL-6 is an important mediator of autism-like behaviors. In this review, a possible pathological mechanism behind autism is proposed, which suggests that IL-6 elevation in the brain, caused by the activated glia and/or maternal immune activation, could be an important inflammatory cytokine response involved in the mediation of autism-like behaviors through impairments of neuroanatomical structures and neuronal plasticity. Further studies to investigate whether IL-6 could be used for therapeutic interventions in autism would be of great significance.

AB  - Abstract
Diabetes is associated with an increased risk for brain disorders, namely cognitive impairments associated with hippocampal dysfunction underlying diabetic encephalopathy. However, the impact of a prediabetic state on cognitive function is unknown. Therefore, we now investigated whether spatial learning and memory deficits and the underlying hippocampal dysfunction were already present in a prediabetic animal model. Adult Wistar rats drinking high-sucrose (HSu) diet (35% sucrose solution during 9 weeks) were compared to controls’ drinking water. HSu rats exhibited fasting normoglycemia accompanied by hyperinsulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia in the fed state, and insulin resistance with impaired glucose tolerance confirming them as a prediabetic rodent model. HSu rats displayed a poorer performance in hippocampal-dependent short- and long-term spatial memory performance, assessed with the modified Y-maze and Morris water maze tasks, respectively; this was accompanied by a reduction of insulin receptor-β density with normal levels of insulin receptor substrate-1 pSer636/639, and decreased hippocampal glucocorticoid receptor levels without changes of the plasma corticosterone levels. Importantly, HSu animals exhibited increased hippocampal levels of AMPA and NMDA receptor subunits GluA1 and GLUN1, respectively, whereas the levels of protein markers related to nerve terminals (synaptophysin) and oxidative stress/inflammation (HNE, RAGE, TNF-α) remained unaltered. These findings indicate that 9 weeks of sucrose consumption resulted in a metabolic condition suggestive of a prediabetic state, which translated into short- and long-term spatial memory deficits accompanied by alterations in hippocampal glutamatergic neurotransmission and abnormal glucocorticoid signaling.

AB  - Abstract
Axon terminals forming mixed chemical/electrical synapses in the lateral vestibular nucleus of rat were described over 40 years ago. Because gap junctions formed by connexins are the morphological correlate of electrical synapses, and with demonstrations of widespread expression of the gap junction protein connexin36 (Cx36) in neurons, we investigated the distribution and cellular localization of electrical synapses in the adult and developing rodent vestibular nuclear complex, using immunofluorescence detection of Cx36 as a marker for these synapses. In addition, we examined Cx36 localization in relation to that of the nerve terminal marker vesicular glutamate transporter-1 (vglut-1). An abundance of immunolabeling for Cx36 in the form of Cx36-puncta was found in each of the four major vestibular nuclei of adult rat and mouse. Immunolabeling was associated with somata and initial dendrites of medium and large neurons, and was absent in vestibular nuclei of Cx36 knockout mice. Cx36-puncta were seen either dispersed or aggregated into clusters on the surface of neurons, and were never found to occur intracellularly. Nearly all Cx36-puncta were localized to large nerve terminals immunolabeled for vglut-1. These terminals and their associated Cx36-puncta were substantially depleted after labyrinthectomy. Developmentally, labeling for Cx36 was already present in the vestibular nuclei at postnatal day 5, where it was only partially co-localized with vglut-1, and did not become fully associated with vglut-1-positive terminals until postnatal day 20–25. The results show that vglut-1-positive primary afferent nerve terminals form mixed synapses throughout the vestibular nuclear complex, that the gap junction component of these synapses contains Cx36, that multiple Cx36-containing gap junctions are associated with individual vglut-1 terminals and that the development of these mixed synapses is protracted over several postnatal weeks.

The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of chronic oxidative stress on mitochondrial function and its relationship to progressive neurodegeneration in the hippocampus of rats chronically exposed to ozone. Animals were exposed to 0.25 ppm ozone for 7, 15, 30, or 60 days. Each group was tested for (1) protein oxidation and, manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity using spectrophotometric techniques, (2) oxygen consumption, (3) cytochrome c, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ Co-activator 1α (PGC-1α), B-cell lymphoma (Bcl-2), and Bax expression using Western blotting, (4) histology using hematoxylin and eosin staining, and (5) mitochondrial structure using electron microscopy. Our results showed increased levels of carbonyl protein and Mn-SOD activity after 30 days of ozone exposure and decreased GPx activity. The SDH activity decreased from 7 to 60 days of exposure. The oxygen consumption decreased at 60 days. Western blotting showed an increase in cytochrome c at 60 days of ozone exposure and an increase in iNOS up to 60 days of ozone exposure. The expression of PGC-1α was decreased after 15, 30, and 60 days compared to the earlier time Bcl-2 was increased at 60 days compared to earlier time points, and Bax was increased after 30 and 60 days of exposure compared to earlier time points. We observed cellular damage, and mitochondrial swelling with a loss of mitochondrial cristae after 60 days of exposure. These changes suggest that low doses of ozone caused mitochondrial abnormalities that may lead to cell damage.

AB  - Abstract
Leptin and somatostatin (SRIF) have opposite effects on food seeking and ingestive behaviors, functions partially regulated by the frontoparietal cortex and hippocampus. Although it is known that the acute suppression of food intake mediated by leptin decreases with time, the counter-regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Our aims were to analyze the effect of acute central leptin infusion on the SRIF receptor-effector system in these areas and the implication of related intracellular signaling mechanisms in this response. We studied 20 adult male Wister rats including controls and those treated intracerebroventricularly with a single dose of 5 μg of leptin and sacrificed 1 or 6 h later. Density of SRIF receptors was unchanged at 1 h, whereas leptin increased the density of SRIF receptors at 6 h, which was correlated with an elevated capacity of SRIF to inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in both areas. The functional capacity of SRIF receptors was unaltered as cell membrane levels of αi1 and αi2 subunits of G inhibitory proteins were unaffected in both brain areas. The increased density of SRIF receptors was due to enhanced SRIF receptor subtype 2 (sst2) protein levels that correlated with higher mRNA levels for this receptor. These changes in sst2 mRNA levels were concomitant with increased activation of the insulin signaling, c-Jun and cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB); however, activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 was reduced in the cortex and unchanged in the hippocampus and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 remained unchanged in these areas. In addition, the leptin antagonist L39A/D40A/F41A blocked the leptin-induced changes in SRIF receptors, leptin signaling and CREB activation. In conclusion, increased activation of insulin signaling after leptin infusion is related to acute up-regulation of the SRIF receptor-effector system that may antagonize short-term leptin actions in the rat brain.

AB  - Abstract
Considerable evidence indicates that dopamine (DA) influences tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-mediated proteolytic processing of the precursor of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF) into mature BDNF (mBDNF). However, specific roles in this process for the dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) and the underlying molecular mechanisms are yet to be fully characterized. In the present study, we hypothesized that D3R deletion could influence tPA activity in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Using D3R knockout (D3−/−) mice, we show that receptor inactivation is associated with increased tPA expression/activity both in the prefrontal cortex and, to a greater extent, in the hippocampus. Augmented tPA expression in D3−/− mice correlated with increased BDNF mRNA levels, plasmin/plasminogen protein ratio and the conversion of proBDNF into mBDNF, as well as enhanced tPA and mBDNF immunoreactivity, as determined by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunoblot and immunohistochemistry. In addition, when compared to wild-type controls, D3−/− mice exhibited increased basal activation of the canonical cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase A (PKA)-driven Akt/cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling cascade, as determined by the increased Akt phosphorylation both at Thr304 and Ser473 residues, of DA and cAMP-regulated protein of 32 kDa (DARPP-32) at Thr34 and a phosphorylation state-dependent inhibition of glycogen synthetase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) at Ser9, a substrate of Akt whose constitutive function impairs normal CREB transcriptional activity through phosphorylation at its Ser129 residue. Accordingly, CREB phosphorylation at Ser133 was significantly increased in D3−/− mice, whereas the GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation at Ser129 was diminished. Altogether, our finding reveals that mice lacking D3Rs show enhanced tPA proteolytic activity on BDNF which may involve, at least in part, a potentiated Akt/CREB signaling, possibly due to hindered GSK-3β activity.

Hemorrhagic stroke, including intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), is a devastating subtype of stroke; yet, effective clinical treatment is very limited. Accumulating evidence has shown that mild to moderate hypothermia is a promising intervention for ischemic stroke and ICH. Current physical cooling methods, however, are less efficient and often impractical for acute ICH patients. The present investigation tested pharmacologically induced hypothermia (PIH) using the second-generation neurotensin receptor (NTR) agonist HPI-201 (formerly known as ABS-201) in an adult mouse model with ICH. Acute or delayed administrations of HPI-201 (2 mg/kg bolus injection followed by 2 injections of 1 mg/kg, i.p.) were initiated at 1 or 24 h after ICH. HPI-201 induced mild hypothermia within 30 min and body and brain temperatures were maintained at 32.7 ± 0.4 °C for at least 6 h without causing observable shivering. With the 1-h delayed treatment, HPI-201-induced PIH significantly reduced ICH-induced cell death and brain edema compared to saline-treated ICH animals. When HPI-201-induced hypothermia was initiated 24 h after the onset of ICH, it still significantly attenuated brain edema, cell death and blood–brain barrier breakdown. HPI-201 significantly decreased the expression of matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9), reduced caspase-3 activation, and increased Bcl-2 expression in the ICH brain. Moreover, ICH mice received 1-h delayed HPI-201 treatment performed significantly better in the neurological behavior test 48 h after ICH. All together, these data suggest that systemic injection of HPI-201 is an effective hypothermic strategy that protects the brain from ICH injury with a wide therapeutic window. The protective effect of this PIH therapy is partially mediated through the alleviation of apoptosis and neurovascular damage. We suggest that pharmacological hypothermia using the newly developed neurotensin analogs is a promising therapeutic treatment for ICH.

AB  - Abstract
The neural correlates of perceptual load induced attentional selection were investigated in an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment in which attentional selection was manipulated through the variation of perceptual load in target search. Participants searched for a vertically or horizontally oriented bar among heterogeneously (the high load condition) or homogeneously (the low load condition) oriented distractor bars in the central display, which was flanked by a vertical or horizontal bar presented at the left or the right periphery. The search reaction times were longer when the central display was of high load than of low load, and were longer when the flanker was incongruent than congruent with the target. Importantly, the flanker congruency effect was manifested only in the low load condition, not in the high load condition, indicating that the perceptual load in target search determined whether the task-irrelevant flanker was processed. Imaging analyses revealed a set of fronto-parietal regions having higher activations in the high than in the low load condition. Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was more activated for the incongruent than for the congruent trials. Moreover, ACC and bilateral anterior insula were sensitive to the interaction between perceptual load and flanker congruency such that the activation differences between the incongruent and congruent conditions were significant in the low, but not in the high load condition. These results are consistent with the claim that ACC and bilateral anterior insula may exert executive control by selectively biasing processing in favor of task-relevant information and this biasing depends on the resources currently available to the control system.

AB  - Abstract
High levels of homocysteine (Hcy), known as hyperhomocysteinemia are associated with neurovascular diseases. H2S, a metabolite of Hcy, has potent anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities; however, the effect of H2S has not been explored in Hcy (IC)-induced neurodegeneration and neurovascular dysfunction in mice. Therefore, the present study was designed to explore the neuroprotective role of H2S on Hcy-induced neurodegeneration and neurovascular dysfunction. To test this hypothesis we employed wild-type (WT) males ages 8–10 weeks, WT + artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), WT + Hcy (0.5 μmol/μl) intracerebral injection (IC, one time only prior to NaHS treatment), WT + Hcy + NaHS (sodium hydrogen sulfide, precursor of H2S, 30 μmol/kg, body weight). NaHS was injected i.p. once daily for the period of 7 days after the Hcy (IC) injection. Hcy treatment significantly increased malondialdehyde, nitrite level, acetylcholinestrase activity, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, glial fibrillary acidic protein, inducible nitric oxide synthase, endothelial nitric oxide synthase and decreased glutathione level indicating oxidative-nitrosative stress and neuroinflammation as compared to control and aCSF-treated groups. Further, increased expression of neuron-specific enolase, S100B and decreased expression of (post-synaptic density-95, synaptosome-associated protein-97) synaptic protein indicated neurodegeneration. Brain sections of Hcy-treated mice showed damage in the cortical area and periventricular cells. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated, dUTP nick-end labeling-positive cells and Fluro Jade-C staining indicated apoptosis and neurodegeneration. The increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) MMP9, MMP2 and decreased expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) TIMP-1, TIMP-2, tight junction proteins (zonula occulden 1) in Hcy-treated group indicate neurovascular remodeling. Interestingly, NaHS treatment significantly attenuated Hcy-induced oxidative stress, memory deficit, neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation and cerebrovascular remodeling. The results indicate that H2S is effective in providing protection against neurodegeneration and neurovascular dysfunction.

AB  - Abstract
Recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is the mainstay of acute stroke treatment and the only approved medical therapy so far. Because of its fibrinolytic action, it is presumed to aggravate intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Since clinical features do not discriminate between ischemic stroke and ICH, brain imaging is strictly required before the initiation of thrombolysis. A recent study has shown that rt-PA does not worsen (primary) ICH in two different experimental mouse models. Here, we further explored this surprising finding and examined hematoma expansion and long-term outcome after rt-PA treatment in a murine model of ICH. We induced ICH by collagenase injection into the right basal ganglia of C57BL/6 mice. At 30 min, 90 min or 4 h after ICH induction, respectively, mice were treated with vehicle or 10 mg/kg rt-PA. In parallel, we administered the vascular tracer Evans Blue (EB) and sacrificed the mice 2 h after injection to assess EB extravasation as a marker of ongoing bleeding and rt-PA induced rebleeding. Additionally, we observed mice which were treated with vehicle or rt-PA 30 min after ICH induction for 72 h and quantified functional outcome and hematoma volume. EB extravasation was highest in the groups that were treated after 30 min and decreased thereafter according to a cessation of active bleeding. At all three time points covering the early phase of ICH, treatment with rt-PA did not increase EB extravasation. In the 72 h observation, there was also no difference in functional outcome and hematoma volume. In our experimental study, we were not able to demonstrate that peracute rt-PA treatment in (primary) ICH has detrimental effects on hematoma expansion, hematoma volume or functional outcome. This finding needs careful consideration in future translational studies.

AB  - Abstract
Hyperprolinemia is an inherited disorder of proline metabolism and hyperprolinemic patients can present neurological manifestations, such as seizures, cognitive dysfunctions, and schizoaffective disorders. However, the mechanisms related to these symptoms are still unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the in vivo and in vitro effects of proline on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and gene expression in the zebrafish brain. For the in vivo studies, animals were exposed at two proline concentrations (1.5 and 3.0 mM) during 1 h or 7 days (short- or long-term treatments, respectively). For the in vitro assays, different proline concentrations (ranging from 3.0 to 1000 μM) were tested. Long-term proline exposures significantly increased AChE activity for both treated groups when compared to the control (34% and 39%). Moreover, the proline-induced increase on AChE activity was completely reverted by acute administration of antipsychotic drugs (haloperidol and sulpiride), as well as the changes induced in ache expression. When assessed in vitro, proline did not promote significant changes in AChE activity. Altogether, these data indicate that the enzyme responsible for the control of acetylcholine levels might be altered after proline exposure in the adult zebrafish. These findings contribute for better understanding of the pathophysiology of hyperprolinemia and might reinforce the use of the zebrafish as a complementary vertebrate model for studying inborn errors of amino acid metabolism.

AB  - Abstract
Previous behavioral studies have revealed that CaV3.2 T-type calcium channels support peripheral nociceptive transmission and electrophysiological studies have established the presence of T-currents in putative nociceptive sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglion (DRG). To date, however, the localization pattern of this key nociceptive channel in the soma and peripheral axons of these cells has not been demonstrated due to lack of isoform-selective anti-CaV3.2 antibodies. In the present study a new polyclonal CaV3.2 antibody is used to localize CaV3.2 expression in rodent DRG neurons using different staining techniques including confocal and electron microscopy (EM). Confocal microscopy of both acutely dissociated cells and short-term cultures demonstrated strong immunofluorescence of anti-CaV3.2 antibody that was largely confined to smaller diameter DRG neurons where it co-localized with established immuno-markers of unmyelinated nociceptors, such as, CGRP, IB4 and peripherin. In contrast, a smaller proportion of these CaV3.2-labeled DRG cells also co-expressed neurofilament 200 (NF200), a marker of myelinated sensory neurons. In the rat sciatic nerve preparation, confocal microscopy demonstrated anti-CaV3.2 immunofluorescence which was co-localized with both peripherin and NF200. Further, EM revealed immuno-gold labeling of CaV3.2 preferentially in association with unmyelinated sensory fibers from mouse sciatic nerve. Finally, we demonstrated the expression of CaV3.2 channels in peripheral nerve endings of mouse hindpaw skin as shown by co-localization with Mrgpd-GFP-positive fibers. The CaV3.2 expression within the soma and peripheral axons of nociceptive sensory neurons further demonstrates the importance of this channel in peripheral pain transmission.

AB  - Abstract
Postural support alters anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs). Efficient adaptation to changes in postural support in reactive and centrally initiated postural synergies is impaired in Parkinson’s disease (PD). This study examined whether APAs are affected differently by familiar and novel supports in people with PD, ON and OFF levodopa. The effect of PD and levodopa on the ability to immediately adapt APAs to changes in support and refine with practice was also investigated. Fourteen people with PD and 14 healthy control participants performed 20 single rapid leg lift tasks in four support conditions: unsupported, bilateral handgrip (familiar), bite plate (novel) and a combined handgrip + bite plate condition. APAs, identified from force plate data, were characterized by an increase in the vertical ground reaction force under the lifted leg as a result of a shift of weight toward the stance limb. Results showed the ability to incorporate familiar and novel external supports into the postural strategy was preserved in PD. Controls and PD patients in the OFF state further refined the postural strategy with practice as evidenced by changes in amplitude of vertical ground reaction forces and forces applied to support apparatus within conditions between the initial and final trials. In the ON state, people with PD failed to refine the use of postural supports in any condition. The results suggest that immediate postural adaptation is intact in people with PD and unaffected by levodopa administration but the ability to refine postural adaptations with task experience is compromised by dopamine therapy.

We explored the attenuating effects of NP-9 on β-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation and amyloid-induced toxicity. NP-9 is a recently reported monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. In the present study, we found that NP-9 inhibited AChE activity in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal inhibition dose of 8 mg/kg, i.p. It inhibited Aβ aggregation, observed through thioflavin-T assay (IC50 = 60 μM) and scanning electron microscopy (S.E.M.) (no fibril formation). NP-9 has shown marked protection against scopolamine and Aβ1–42-induced memory impairments. It also minimized neuronal loss and amyloid plaque deposition in the brains of Aβ1–42-induced mice model. Therefore, NP-9 could be a promising lead molecule for AD, with effects against MAO-B, AChE, Aβ aggregation, and Aβ1–42 induced toxicity.

AB  - Abstract
Obesity and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly prevalent and often comorbid health conditions. Both are associated with differences in brain structure and are genetically influenced. Yet, little is known about how obesity, MDD, and known risk genotypes might interact in the brain. Subjects were 81 patients with MDD (mean age 48.6 years) and 69 matched healthy controls (mean age 51.2 years). Subjects underwent 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging, genotyping for the fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene rs3751812 polymorphism, and measurements for body mass index (BMI). We conducted a whole brain voxelwise analysis using tensor-based morphometry (TBM) to examine the main and interaction effects of diagnosis, BMI and FTO genotype. Significant effects of BMI were observed across widespread brain regions, indicating reductions in predominantly subcortical and white matter areas associated with increased BMI, but there was no influence of MDD or FTO rs3751812 genotype. There were no significant interaction effects. Within MDD patients, there was no effect of current depressive symptoms; however the use of antidepressant medication was associated with reductions in brain volume in the frontal lobe and cerebellum. Obesity affects brain structure in both healthy participants and MDD patients; this influence may account for some of the brain changes previously associated with MDD. BMI and the use of medication should ideally be measured and controlled for when conducting structural brain imaging research in MDD.

The aim of this study was to test the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) as a neuroprotective agent in a rat model for ischemic stroke and to compare its neuroprotective effects in conscious normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats. The effects of subcutaneous IGF-I injection were investigated in both rat strains using the endothelin-1 rat model for ischemic stroke. Motor-sensory functions were measured using the Neurological Deficit Score. Infarct size was assessed by Cresyl Violet staining. Subcutaneous administration of IGF-I resulted in significantly reduced infarct volumes and an increase in motor-sensory functions in normotensive rats. In these rats, IGF-I did not modulate blood flow in the striatum and had no effect on the activation of astrocytes as assessed by GFAP staining. In hypertensive rats, the protective effects of IGF-I were smaller and not always significant. Furthermore, IGF-I significantly reduced microglial activation in the cortex of hypertensive rats, but not in normotensive rats. More detailed studies are required to find out whether the reduction by IGF-I of microglial activation contributes to an impairment IGF-I treatment efficacy. Indeed, we have shown before that microglia in hypertensive rats have different properties compared to those in control rats, as they exhibit a reduced responsiveness to ischemic stroke and lipopolysaccharide.

Oxidative stress aggravates brain injury following ischemia. The glutathione (GSH) system plays a pivotal role in combating oxidative stress in various cell types. To determine whether oral GSH administration elicits anti-oxidative effects, we assessed its potential neuroprotective effects in transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) mice. In naïve mice, acute oral administration of GSH significantly increased GSH levels by 1 h in the cortex and hippocampus. Eleven days after BCCAO, untreated mice showed significantly decreased GSH levels and an inverse elevation of glutathione-disulfide (GSSG) levels in both the cortex and hippocampus. Oral administration of GSH (100 and 500 mg/kg p.o.) for 10 consecutive days after ischemia restored reduced GSH levels and inhibited GSSG elevation. Notably, post-administration of GSH (100 and 500 mg/kg p.o.) significantly prevented neuronal cell death in the hippocampal CA1 region in BCCAO mice, an effect closely correlated with decreased levels of oxidative markers such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and nitrotyrosine in that region. Finally, GSH administration for 10 days improved memory deficits observed in BCCAO mice. Taken together, our findings indicate that the anti-oxidative effect of oral GSH administration ameliorates post-ischemia neuronal cell death and, in turn, may improve memory.

AB  - Abstract
Although extensive evidence demonstrates that repeated administration of amphetamine (AMPH) induces behavioral and neurochemical sensitization, the influence of the developmental timing of AMPH administration is unknown. This is an important issue to address because it could help clarify the influence of early drug exposure on neuronal plasticity and the involvement of dopaminergic sensitization in the etiopathology of neuropsychiatric disorders.

Thus, we decided to investigate the molecular alterations induced by the administration of AMPH during adolescence, when repeated exposure to the psychostimulant may interfere with developmental neuroplasticity. We investigated the expression of the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and of two inducible-early genes (arc and cfos) that bridge neuronal activity with long-lasting functional alterations. We found that peri-pubertal treatment with AMPH induces long-lasting changes in the expression of bdnf and of activity-regulated genes in the hippocampus and in the prefrontal/frontal cortex, and leads to alterations of their short-term modulation in response to a subsequent acute AMPH challenge. These data suggest that AMPH exposure in peri-puberty may negatively affect the maturation of brain structures, such as the prefrontal cortex, which facilitate the development of dopamine sensitization and may contribute to dopamine-dependent behavioral dysfunctions and molecular alterations in adulthood.

AB  - Abstract
We previously reported that the novel antidepressant-like effect of tipepidine may be produced at least partly through the activation of mesolimbic dopamine (DA) neurons via inhibiting G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels. In this study, we investigated the action of tipepidine on DA D2 receptor-mediated GIRK currents (IDA(GIRK)) and membrane excitability in DA neurons using the voltage clamp and current clamp modes of the patch-clamp techniques, respectively. DA neurons were acutely dissociated from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in rats and identified by the presence of the hyperpolarization-activated currents. Tipepidine reversibly inhibited IDA(GIRK) with IC50 7.0 μM and also abolished IDA(GIRK) irreversibly activated in the presence of intracellular GTPγS. Then tipepidine depolarized membrane potential and generated action potentials in the neurons current-clamped. Furthermore, the drug at 40 mg/kg, i.p. increased the number of cells immunopositive both for c-Fos and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the VTA. These results suggest that tipepidine may activate DA neurons in VTA through the inhibition of GIRK channel-activated currents.

AB  - Abstract
The rat retrosplenial granular cortex (RSG) receives cholinergic input from the medial septum–diagonal band (MS–DB) of the cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF), with projections terminating in layers I–III of RSG. The modulatory effects of acetylcholine (ACh) on cortical GABAergic interneurons in these layers are mediated by α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChRs). α7nAChRs are most abundant in the cerebral cortex and are largely localized to GABAergic interneurons. However, the CBF projection to the RSG has not been studied in detail, and the cellular or subcellular distribution of α7nAChRs in the rat RSG remains unclear. The main objective of this study was to test that α7nAChRs reside on GABAergic interneurons in CBF terminal fields of the rat RSG.

First, we set out to define the characteristics of CBF projections from the MS–DB to layers of the RSG using anterograde neural tracing and immunohistochemical labeling with cholinergic markers. These results revealed that the pattern of axon terminal labeling in layer Ia, as well as layer II/III of the RSG is remarkably similar to the pattern of cholinergic axons in the RSG. Next, we investigated the relationship between α7nAChRs, labeled using either α-bungarotoxin or α7nAChR antibody, and the local neurochemical environment by labeling surrounding cells with antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), parvalbumin (PV) and reelin (a marker of the ionotropic serotonin receptor-expressing GABAergic interneurons). α7nAChRs were found to be localized on both somatodendritic and neuronal elements within subpopulations of GABAergic PV-, reelin-stained and non PV-stained neurons in layers I–III of the RSG. Finally, electron microscopy revealed that α7nAChRs are GAD- and PV-positive cytoplasmic and neuronal elements.

These results strongly suggest that ACh released from CBF afferents is transmitted via α7nAChR to GAD-, PV-, and reelin-positive GABAergic interneurons in layers I–III of the RSG.

AB  - Abstract
GABA is thought to function as a paracrine factor in adrenal medullary (AM) cells. Thus, we electrophysiologically and immunologically examined the properties of GABAA receptors (GABAARs) in guinea-pig AM cells. Bath application of GABA produced an inward current at −60 mV in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 32.3 μM. This GABA-induced current was enhanced by allopregnanolone at concentrations of 0.01 μM and more. A prior exposure to allopregnanolone resulted in a decrease in an EC50 for GABA in activating GABAARs. The GABA-induced current was suppressed by Zn2+ in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 18 μM, whereas it was enhanced by 100 μM La3+. The benzodiazepine analog diazepam was three times more potent than zolpidem in enhancing the GABA current, and it was also augmented by L-838,417, which has no action on α1-containing GABAARs. The GABAAR α3, but not α1, and γ2 subunits were immunologically detected at the cell periphery. The expression of α3 subunits in PC12 cells was enhanced by glucocorticoid activity. The results indicated that GABAARs in guinea-pig AM cells mainly comprise α3, β, and γ2 subunits and are enhanced by allopreganalone and glucocorticoids may play a major role in the expression of α3 subunits.

AB  - Abstract
Mas oncogene-related gene (Mrg) G protein-coupled receptors are exclusively expressed in small-sized neurons in trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in mammals. The present study investigated the effect of MrgC receptor activation on morphine analgesic potency and addressed its possible mechanisms. Intrathecal (i.t.) administration of the specific MrgC receptor agonist bovine adrenal medulla 8-22 (BAM8-22, 3 nmol) increased morphine-induced analgesia and shifted the morphine dose–response curve to the left in rats. Acute morphine (5 μg) reduced the coupling of μ-opioid receptors (MORs) to Gi-, but not Gs-, protein in the spinal dorsal horn. The i.t. BAM8-22 (3 nmol) prevented this change of G-protein repertoire while the inactive MrgC receptor agonist BAM8-18 (3 nmol, i.t.) failed to do so. A double labeling study showed the co-localization of MrgC and MORs in DRG neurons. The i.t. BAM8-22 also increased the coupling of MORs to Gi-protein and recruited Gi-protein from cytoplasm to the cell membrane in the spinal dorsal horn. Application of BAM8-22 (10 nM) in the cultured ganglion explants for 30 min increased Gi-protein mRNA, but not Gs-protein mRNA. The present study demonstrated that acute administration of morphine inhibited the repertoire of MOR/Gi-protein coupling in the spinal dorsal horn in vivo. The findings highlight a novel mechanism by which the activation of MrgC receptors can modulate the coupling of MORs with Gi-protein to enhance morphine-induced analgesia. Hence, adjunct treatment of MrgC agonist BAM8-22 may be of therapeutic value to relieve pain.

AB  - Abstract
Reactive astrogliosis, a feature of neuro-inflammation is induced by a number of endogenous mediators including cytokines. Despite interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) stands out as the major inducer of this process, the underlying mechanism and its role on neuronal viability remain elusive. We investigated in human astrocytoma cells and the rat brain striatum, the role of the nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) calmodulin (CaM) and extracellular regulated mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK1/2) in IL-1β-induced expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neuronal apoptosis associated to a brain trauma. Cell data showed that IL-1β (1 ng/ml) increased NF-kB, pERK1/2 and GFAP expression. Nevertheless, further increase in IL-1β levels reversed progressively these responses. Preventing ERK1/2 activation with 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis[2-aminophenylthiol]-butadiene antagonized IL-1β-induced GFAP expression while inhibiting selectively nuclear translocation of NF-kB with caffeic-acid phenethyl-ester down-regulated both ERK1/2 and GFAP expression induced by IL-1β. The GFAP response was also prevented by antagonizing selectively increase in [Ca2+]i, CaM activity or inducible nitric oxide synthase expression with respectively ryanodine plus 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl-borate, N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalensulfonamide hydrochloride and N-[(3-(aminomethyl)-phenyl]methyl]-ethanimidamide dihydrochloride. Data in vivo supported these findings and showed that GFAP expression induced by IL-1β (50 ng/ml) correlated with attenuated glial scar formation and reduced neuronal apoptosis. Our data identified the NF-kB/Ca2+–CaM/ERK signaling pathway as a novel in vivo key regulator of IL-1β-induced astrogliosis which may represent a potential target in neurodegeneration.

AB  - Abstract
The regenerative capacity of the peripheral nervous system is largely related to Schwann cells undergoing proliferation and migration after injury and forming growth-supporting substrates for severed axons. Novel data show that fibroblasts to a certain extent regulate the pro-regenerative behavior of Schwann cells. In the setting of peripheral nerve injury, the fibroblasts that form the epineurium come into close contact with both Schwann cells and peripheral axons, but the potential influence on these latter two cell types has not been studied yet. In the present study we explored whether culture media, conditioned by epineurial fibroblasts can influence Schwann cells and/or neurite outgrowth from dorsal root ganglia neurons in vitro. Our data indicate that epineurial fibroblast-conditioned culture media substantially increase Schwann cell migration and the outgrowth of neurites. Schwann cell proliferation remained largely unaffected. These same read-out parameters were assayed in a condition where epineurial fibroblasts were subjected to stretch-cell-stress, a mechanical stressor that plays an important role in traumatic peripheral nerve injuries. Stretch-cell-stress of epineurial fibroblasts did not further change the positive effects of conditioned media on Schwann cell migration and neurite outgrowth. From these data we conclude that an as yet unknown pro-regenerative role can be attributed to epineurial fibroblasts, implying that such cells may affect the outcome of severe peripheral nerve injury.

AB  - Abstract
Sleep is an essential physiological process that underlies crucial cognitive functions as well as emotional reactivity. Thus, sleep deprivation (SD) may exert various deleterious effects.

In this study, we aimed to examine the adverse behavioral and hormonal effects of SD and a potential treatment with Plant-derived nanoparticle treatment – cocc 30c. The study was a 4-arm trial with randomization and double-blinding of verum and placebo treatments.

SD was induced by using the Multiple Platform Method for 48 h. The effects of SD were evaluated behaviorally (pre-pulse inhibition (PPI), startle response and rotor-rod) at baseline as well as at 6, 12, 24 h, and 14 days post deprivation. cocc 30c treatment was administrated Per Os every three hours starting immediately after baseline tests and for a period of 24 h. On day 14, blood samples were taken and serum levels of corticosterone, testosterone, serotonin and leptin were tested. We found that cocc 30c improved PPI 12 and 24 h post deprivation, likewise, cocc 30c improved motor learning. On day 14 SD led to increased startle response that was ameliorated by cocc 30c. Likewise, SD led to increased levels of corticosterone and serotonin while decreasing testosterone and leptin. Interestingly, cocc 30c treatment has moderated these hormonal alterations.

We conclude that the treatment with cocc 30c recovers both short-term behavioral and the long-term hormonal modulations following SD.

AB  - Abstract
Aquaporin-1 (AQP1) is the principle water channel in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and is specifically localized to Schwann cells in the PNS. However, the pathophysiological role of AQP1 in peripheral nerves is poorly understood. Here, we utilized RNA interference by lentiviral transduction to specifically down-regulate AQP1 expression and a lentiviral overexpression protocol to up-regulate AQP1 expression, in primary Schwann cell cultures. AQP1 gene silencing resulted in a cell shrinkage phenotype, while AQP1 gene overexpression caused a cell swelling phenotype, as validated by cell volume determinations. Secondly, we utilized an in vitro hypoxia model in Schwann cells to mimic in vivo facial nerve injury. We demonstrated that AQP1 expression was induced within 8 h following hypoxia injury in vitro, and that AQP1 knockdown (KD) caused the cells to resist edema following hypoxia. Finally, we investigated the hypoxic regulation of the AQP1 gene, as well as the involvement of Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in AQP1 modulation and we found that KD of HIF-1α decreased hypoxia-dependent induction of endogenous AQP1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Taken together, these results indicate that (1) AQP1 is an important factor responsible for the fast water transport of cultured Schwann cells and is involved in cell plasticity; (2) AQP1 alterations may be a primary factor in hypoxia-induced peripheral nerve edema; (3) HIF-1α participates in the hypoxic induction of the AQP1 gene; (4) AQP1 inhibition might provide a new therapeutic alternative for the treatment of some forms of peripheral nerve edema.

AB  - Abstract
Striatal dopaminergic denervation leads to a change in afferent activity within the basal ganglia. Coupled with the effect of local dopaminergic denervation in the subthalamic nucleus, this is likely to affect the responsiveness of subthalamic neurons to their hyperdirect inputs in Parkinson’s disease. Therefore, in this report, we investigated subthalamic nucleus responses to visual stimuli relayed by one such input – the superior colliculus – in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats. We used a protocol where the superior colliculus was selectively unlocked from the inhibitory effect of anesthesia with an injection of bicuculline, attenuating GABAergic inhibition in the colliculus, which arises predominantly from the substantia nigra pars reticulata. We found that visual responses in the superior colliculus were facilitated by partial or total lesions of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, once the colliculus was disinhibited by bicuculline. Responses were faster, larger in amplitude and lasted longer compared to those in control rats. In the subthalamic nucleus, visual responses were also increased in amplitude and magnitude in partial or total lesioned groups. A classic hypothesis in Parkinson’s disease suggests that following dopaminergic denervation, the discharge of cells in the substantia nigra pars reticulata increases, thereby intensifying the inhibitory influence that this structure exerts on its targets in the thalamus and brainstem. Our results suggest that neuroadaptations may have taken place within the superior colliculus in order to maintain normal function in the face of increased inhibitory tone coming from the substantia nigra pars reticulata, which once reduced, gave rise to facilitated responding. This facilitated responding in the superior colliculus then appears to lead to facilitated responding in the subthalamic nucleus.

AB  - Abstract
The voluntary control of respiration is used as a common means to regulate pain and emotions and is fundamental to various relaxation and meditation techniques. The aim of the present study was to examine how breathing frequency and phase affect pain perception, spinal nociceptive activity (RIII-reflex) and brain activity (scalp somatosensory-evoked potentials – SEP’s). In 20 healthy volunteers, painful electric shocks individually adjusted to 120% of the RIII-reflex threshold were delivered to the sural nerve near the end of inspiration or expiration phases, during three cued-breathing conditions: (1) slow breathing (0.1 Hz) with slow (4 s) inspiration (0.1 Hz-SlowIns), (2) slow breathing (0.1 Hz) with fast (2 s) inspiration (0.1 Hz-FastIns), and (3) normal breathing (0.2 Hz) with fast (2 s) inspiration (0.2 Hz). Pain ratings were not affected by breathing patterns (p = 0.3), but were significantly lower during inspiration compared with expiration (p = 0.02). This phase effect was also observed on the N100 component of SEP’s, but only in the 0.1-Hz-FastIns condition (p = 0.03). In contrast, RIII-reflex amplitude was greater during inspiration compared with expiration (p = 0.02). It was also decreased in the 0.1-Hz-SlowIns compared with the 0.2-Hz condition (p = 0.01). Slow breathing also increased the amplitude of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), although these changes were not significantly associated with changes in pain responses. In conclusion, this study shows that pain and pain-related brain activity may be reduced during inspiration but these changes are dissociated from spinal nociceptive transmission. The small amplitude of these effects suggests that factors other than respiration contribute to the analgesic effects of relaxation and meditation techniques.

AB  - Abstract
Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) may affect the excitability of brain circuits by inhibiting neurotransmitter release at central synapses. There is evidence that local delivery of BoNT serotypes A and E, which target SNAP-25, a component of the release machinery specific to excitatory synapses, can inhibit seizure generation. BoNT serotype B (BoNT/B) targets VAMP2, which is expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory terminals. Here we assessed the effects of unilateral intrahippocampal infusion of BoNT/B in the rat on intravenous pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) seizure thresholds, and on the expression of spontaneous behavioral and electrographic seizures. Infusion of BoNT/B (500 and 1000 unit) by convection-enhanced delivery caused a reduction in myoclonic twitch and clonic seizure thresholds in response to intravenous PTZ beginning about 6 days after the infusion. Handling-evoked and spontaneous convulsive seizures were observed in many BoNT/B-treated animals but not in vehicle-treated controls. Spontaneous electrographic seizure discharges were recorded in the dentate gyrus of animals that received local BoNT/B infusion. In addition, there was an increased frequency of interictal epileptiform spikes and sharp waves at the same recording site. BoNT/B-treated animals also exhibited tactile hyperresponsivity in comparison with vehicle-treated controls. This is the first demonstration that BoNT/B causes a delayed proconvulsant action when infused into the hippocampus. Local infusion of BoNT/B could be useful as a focal epilepsy model.

AB  - Abstract
The zebra finch song system provides an excellent model to study the mechanisms underlying the development of sex difference in brain structure and function. Only male zebra finches sing and the brain nuclei controlling song learning and production are considerably larger than in females. Sexual differentiation may in part be regulated by estrogen, but other molecules including neurotrophic factors likely also affect masculinization. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a crucial role in numerous aspects of vertebrate brain development and function, including neurogenesis, cell survival, growth of axonal projections, synaptogenesis and processes linked to learning and memory. The current study investigated the expression of BDNF protein in juvenile males and females at four ages, as well as in adults, to begin to evaluate the potential roles of endogenous BDNF in particular stages of structural and functional development of the song system. In both HVC and the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), males had more BDNF+ cells than females. The number of immunopositive cells increased in males and decreased in females as they matured, in a pattern generally consistent with a role for BDNF in sensorimotor integration of song learning. In addition, in HVC (but not RA) the ratio of mature BDNF compared to its precursor proBDNF was greater in adult males than those at post-hatching day 25, indicating a region-specific shift in the relative availability of the two forms. Collectively, the data suggest that changes in BDNF protein expression across development may be associated with song system maturation, particularly during the sensorimotor integration of masculine vocalizations.

AB  - Abstract
The medial perforant path (MPP) and lateral perforant path (LPP) inputs to the hippocampal dentate gyrus form two distinct laminar inputs onto the middle and distal aspects of granule cell dendrites. Previous evidence indicated that paired stimuli reliably produced paired-pulse depression (PPD) in the MPP and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) in the LPP. Despite this, several years of practical experience in our laboratory questioned the utility of using paired-pulse administration to reliably differentiate the MPP and LPP in vitro. Using visualized field and whole-cell recordings in male Sprague–Dawley rats, we demonstrate that both pathways show net PPF of the excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) at 50-ms interpulse intervals. LPP afferents did reliably exhibit greater PPF than MPP afferents. Thus, the LPP reliably exhibits a greater paired-pulse ratio than the MPP. The magnitude of the paired-pulse ratio was reduced in both afferents by raising calcium levels or lowering the temperature of the recording chamber. PPD of MPP-evoked fEPSPs was only reliably detected at moderate to high stimulus intensities when population spike activity was evident. PPD was more evident in whole cell voltage clamp recordings but nonetheless was not completely diagnostic as PPD was occasionally observed with LPP stimulation as well. We found the MPP and LPP could be reliably identified using conventional microscopy with hippocampal slices, and that they could be distinguished through the analysis of evoked waveform kinetics. This work refines our knowledge of electrophysiological differences between MPP and LPP projections and will help to facilitate the selective activation of these pathways.

AB  - Abstract
It is reported that the amyloid-β protein (Aβ)-induced impairments in synaptic plasticity coincide with memory decline and dementia. Although Aβ-induced inhibition of hippocampal long-term potentiation has been intensively investigated, the underlying mechanism of Aβ-enhanced long-term depression (LTD) is not clear. Here, we report that acute exposure of rat hippocampal slices to soluble Aβ-enhanced LTD induced by weak low-frequency stimulation (wLFS; 1 Hz for 3 min, 180 pulses) in granule cells of the dentate gyrus. Application of LY341495 (a non-selective Group I/II metrabotropic glumate receptor (mGluR) antagonist) completely blocked Aβ-enhanced LTD, whereas D-AP5 (a not selective N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist) had no effect on Aβ-enhanced LTD compared with controls. In addition, Aβ-enhanced LTD was occluded by pre-application of 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine, a Group1 mGluR (mGluR1/5) agonist, suggesting Aβ-enhanced LTD depends on mGluR1/5 but not NMDAR. We also report here that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) inhibitor SB203580 and postsynaptic protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors phenylarsine oxide and sodium orthovanadate prevented the facilitatory effect of Aβ on LTD. Application of striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) activator MG132 facilitated induction of LTD by wLFS, but did not block following Aβ-enhanced LTD induced by another wLFS. On the other hand, Aβ-enhanced LTD blocked following MG132-LTD by wLFS, suggesting Aβ-enhanced hippocampal LTD involves STEP activation. Application of either non-selective caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK or caspase-3 selective inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK prevented Aβ-enhanced LTD. However, neither the tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme inhibitor TAPI-2 nor the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor rapamycin prevented the enhancement of Aβ on LTD. Therefore, we conclude that soluble Aβ enhances LTD in the hippocampal dentate gyrus region, and the facilitatory effect of Aβ on LTD involves mGluR1/5, p38MAPK, STEP and caspase-3 activation.

AB  - Abstract
Neuronal migration during brain development sets the position of neurons for the subsequent wiring of neural circuits. To understand the molecular mechanism regulating the migrating process, we considered the migration of mouse precerebellar neurons. Precerebellar neurons originate in the rhombic lip of the hindbrain and show stereotypic, long-distance tangential migration along the circumference of the hindbrain to form precerebellar nuclei at discrete locations. To identify the molecular components underlying this navigation, we screened for genes expressed in the migrating precerebellar neurons. As a result, we identified the following three genes through the screening; Calm1, Septin 11, and Csde1. We report here functional analysis of one of these genes, Csde1, an RNA-binding protein implicated in the post-transcriptional regulation of a subset of cellular mRNA, by examining its participation in precerebellar neuronal migration. We found that shRNA-mediated inhibition of Csde1 expression resulted in a failure of precerebellar neurons to complete their migration into their prospective target regions, with many neurons remaining in migratory paths. Furthermore, those that did reach their destination failed to invade the depth of the hindbrain via radial migration. These results have uncovered a crucial role of Csde1 in the proper control of both radial and tangential migration of precerebellar neurons.

AB  - Abstract
Cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1R) signaling system is extensively distributed in the vertebrate retina. Activation of CB1Rs regulates a variety of functions of retinal neurons through modulating different ion channels. In the present work we studied effects of this receptor signaling on K+ channels in retinal ganglion cells by patch-clamp techniques. The CB1R agonist WIN55212-2 (WIN) suppressed outward K+ currents in acutely isolated rat retinal ganglion cells in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 of 4.7 μM. We further showed that WIN mainly suppressed the tetraethylammonium (TEA)-sensitive K+ current component. While CB1Rs were expressed in rat retinal ganglion cells, the WIN effect on K+ currents was not blocked by either AM251/SR141716, specific CB1R antagonists, or AM630, a selective CB2R antagonist. Consistently, cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways were unlikely involved in the WIN-induced suppression of the K+ currents because both PKA inhibitors H-89/Rp-cAMP and MAPK/ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 failed to block the WIN effects. WIN-induced suppression of the K+ currents was not observed when WIN was intracellularly applied. Furthermore, an endogenous ligand of the cannabinoid receptor anandamide, the specific CB1R agonist ACEA and the selective CB2R agonist CB65 also suppressed the K+ currents, and the effects were not blocked by AM251/SR141716 or AM630 respectively. All these results suggest that the WIN-induced suppression of the outward K+ currents in rat retinal ganglion cells, thereby regulating the cell excitability, were not through CB1R/CB2R signaling pathways.

AB  - Abstract
The spinal cord plays a key role in motor behavior. It relays major sensory information, receives afferents from supraspinal centers and integrates movement in the central pattern generators. Spinal motor output is controlled via corticofugal pathways including corticospinal and cortico-subcortical projections. Spinal cord injury damages descending supraspinal as well as ascending sensory pathways. In adult rodent models, plasticity of the spinal cord is thought to contribute to functional recovery. How much spinal cord function depends on cortical input is not well known. Here, we address this question using Celsr3/Foxg1 mice, in which cortico-subcortical connections (including corticospinal tract (CST) and the terminal sensory pathway, the thalamocortical tract) are genetically ablated during early development. Although Celsr3/Foxg1 mice are able to eat, walk, climb on grids and swim, open-field tests showed them to be hyperactive. When compared with normal littermates, mutant animals had reduced number of spinal motor neurons, with atrophic dendritic trees. Furthermore, motor axon terminals were decreased in number, and this was confirmed by electromyography. The number of cholinergic, calbindin, and calretinin-positive interneurons was moderately increased in the mutant spinal cord, whereas that of reelin and parvalbumin-positive interneurons was unchanged. As far as we know, our study provides the first genetic evidence that the spinal motor network does not mature fully in the absence of corticofugal connections, and that some motor function is preserved despite congenital absence of the CST.

AB  - Abstract
Three-dimensional changes in the angular orientation of the head were monitored during galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) delivered through electrodes implanted bilaterally in the tensor tympani muscle of the guinea-pig middle ear. Bilateral GVS was delivered by passing current between both ears with the anode situated in one ear and the cathode in the other ear. Unilateral GVS was also delivered between one ear and an indifferent electrode on the skull. Constant-current stimulation caused the head to tilt predominantly within the roll and yaw planes toward an ear stimulated with anodal current and away from an ear stimulated with cathodal current. No significant head tilt in the pitch plane was observed with either bilateral or unilateral GVS. Bilateral GVS was found to induce significantly greater roll head tilt (RHT) and yaw head tilt (YHT) than the same intensity of unilateral anodal or cathodal GVS, but not the sum of responses induced by the two polarities of unilateral GVS. Significant asymmetries were observed in the responses of YHT and RHT for unilateral anodal and cathodal GVS; unilateral cathodal stimulation generated greater head deviation compared with the same intensity of unilateral anodal stimulation. These asymmetric responses are consistent with activation of irregularly discharging afferents, which have been shown previously to exhibit asymmetric responses for anodal and cathodal GVS (Kim and Curthoys, 2004). Together with the observations of previous guinea-pig studies, the results suggest that head movements induced by GVS may be mediated by irregularly discharging afferents innervating the otoliths, and possibly the horizontal semicircular canals.

AB  - Abstract
It has been shown that the X-chromosome-linked neural cell adhesion molecule L1 plays a beneficial role in regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI) in young adult rodents when applied in various molecular and cellular forms. In an attempt to further characterize the multiple functions of L1 after severe SCI we analyzed locomotor functions and measured axonal regrowth/sprouting and sparing, glial scarring, and synaptic remodeling at 6 weeks after severe spinal cord compression injury at the T7–9 levels of L1-deficient mice (L1−/y) and their wild-type (L1+/y) littermates, as well as mice that overexpress L1 under the control of the neuron-specific Thy-1 promoter (L1tg) and their wild-type littermates (L1+/+). No differences were found in the locomotor scale score and single frame motion analysis between L1−/y and L1+/y mice during 6 weeks after SCI, most likely due to the very low expression of L1 in the adult spinal cord of wild-type mice. L1tg mice, however, showed better locomotor recovery than their L1+/+ littermates, being associated with enhanced numbers of catecholaminergic axons in the lumbar spinal cord, but not of cholinergic, GABAergic or glutamatergic terminals around motoneuron cell bodies in the lumbar spinal cord. Additionally, no difference between L1tg and L1+/+ mice was detectable in dieback of corticospinal tract axons. Neuronal L1 overexpression did not influence the size of the glial fibrillary acidic protein-immunoreactive astrocytic scar 6 weeks after injury. We conclude that neuronal overexpression of L1 improves functional recovery from SCI by increasing catecholaminergic axonal regrowth/sprouting and/or sparing of severed axons without affecting the glial scar size.

AB  - Abstract
The ventromedial spinal cord of mammals contains a neural network known as the locomotor central pattern generator (CPG) which underlies the basic generation and coordination of muscle activity during walking. To understand how this neural network operates, it is necessary to identify, characterize, and map connectivity among its constituent cells. Recently, a series of studies have analyzed the activity pattern of interneurons that are rhythmically active during locomotion and suggested that they belong to one of two functional levels; one responsible for rhythm generation and the other for pattern formation. Here we use electrophysiological techniques to identify locomotor-related interneurons in the lumbar spinal cord of the neonatal mouse. By analyzing their activity during spontaneous deletions that occur during fictive locomotion we are able to distinguish between those likely to belong to the rhythm-generating and pattern-forming levels, and determine the regional distribution of each. Anatomical tracing techniques are also employed to investigate the morphological characteristics of cells belonging to each level. Results demonstrate that putative rhythm-generating cells are medially located and extend locally projecting axons, while those with activity consistent with pattern formation are located more laterally and send axonal projections to the lateral edge of the spinal cord, in the direction of the motoneuron pools. Results of this study provide insight into the detailed anatomical organization of the locomotor CPG.

AB  - Abstract
Although the wake-promoting drug modafinil has been shown to bind quite exclusively to the dopamine transporter (DAT), its action in the brain has been thought to be partially independent from the facilitation of the dopaminergic signals. Here we used electrophysiological and amperometric techniques to investigate the effects of modafinil on the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and on the synaptic overflow of dopamine in the dorsal striatum from the sliced tissue of wild-type and cocaine-insensitive genetically modified mice (DAT-CI). Moreover, we examined the consequences of modafinil administration on the locomotor behavior of wild-type and DAT-CI mice. In in vitro experiments, modafinil inhibited the spontaneous firing discharge of the dopaminergic neurons. More consistently, it potentiated firing inhibition and the membrane responses caused by exogenously applied dopamine on these cells. Furthermore, it augmented the stimulus-evoked outflow of DA in the striatum. Noteworthy, modafinil caused locomotor activation in wild-type mice. On the other hand, neither the electrophysiological nor the behavioral effects of modafinil were detected in DAT-CI animals. These results demonstrate that modafinil potentiates brain dopaminergic signals via DAT inhibition by acting at the same binding site of cocaine. Therefore, this mechanism of action explains most of the pharmacological properties of this compound in the clinical setting.

Niemann–Pick Type C1 (NPC1) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the accumulation of cholesterol and glycosphingolipids. Combination-treatment utilizing cyclodextrin, allopregnanolone and miglustat (CYCLO/ALLO/miglustat) can ameliorate NPC1 disease in a mutant mouse model. The present study was designed to add behavioral analysis in NPC1 mutant mice upon CYCLO/ALLO/miglustat therapy.

NPC1 mutant (BALB/cJ NPC1NIH) and control mice were used. For the combination treatment mice were injected with CYCLO/ALLO weekly, starting at P7. The miglustat injection was performed daily from P10 till P23. Starting at P23, miglustat was added to the powdered chow. For the sham treatment of control and mutant mice the same schedule was used with 0.9% NaCl injection. Locomotor activity was assessed in open field, elevated plus maze and accelerod tests. For assessment of spatial learning and memory the Morris water maze test was conducted. Electron microscopy has been performed to support the behavioral data.

The sham-treated mutant mice exhibited motor impairments in all performed tests. In the water maze the sham-treated mutants exhibited impairment in remembering the location of the hidden platform. CYCLO/ALLO/miglustat treatment positively influenced motor dysfunction: total distance and number of visits significantly increased, and accelerod performance improved. The spatial learning, however, did not benefit from therapy.

At the morphological level, an excessive accumulation of electron-dense material was seen in the cerebellar Purkinje cells of mutant mice. A regression of these autophagosomal inclusions was seen upon therapy.

CYCLO/ALLO/miglustat therapy ameliorates motor but not cognitive deficits in NPC1 mutant mice, suggesting unequal vulnerability of different brain areas to the treatment.

Accumulating evidence suggests that the metabolism of l-arginine, a metabolically versatile amino acid, is critically involved in the aging process. The present study compared the activity and protein expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and arginase, and the levels of l-arginine and its eight down-stream metabolites in the brain stem (pons and medulla) and the cervical spinal cord in 3- (young) and 22- (aged) month-old male Sprague–Dawley rats. Total NOS activity was significantly reduced with age in the spinal cord (but not brain stem), and there were no age-related changes in arginase activity in both regions. Western blot revealed decreased protein expression of endothelial NOS, but not neuronal NOS, with age in both regions. Furthermore, there were significantly decreased l-arginine, glutamate, GABA and spermine levels and increased putrescine and spermidine levels with age in both regions. Although the absolute concentrations of l-arginine and six metabolites were significantly different between the brain stem and spinal cord in both age groups, there were similar clusters between l-arginine and its three main metabolites (l-citrulline, l-ornithine and agmatine) in both regions, which changed as a function of age. These findings, for the first time, demonstrate the regional variations and age-related changes in arginine metabolism in the rat brain stem and spinal cord. Future research is required to understand the functional significance of these changes and the underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract
In the striatum, the dendritic tree of the two main populations of projection neurons, called “medium spiny neurons (MSNs)”, are covered with spines that receive glutamatergic inputs from the cerebral cortex and thalamus. In Parkinson’s disease (PD), striatal MSNs undergo an important loss of dendritic spines, whereas aberrant overgrowth of striatal spines occurs following chronic cocaine exposure. This review examines the possibility that opposite dopamine dysregulation is one of the key factors that underlies these structural changes. In PD, nigrostriatal dopamine degeneration results in a significant loss of dendritic spines in the dorsal striatum, while rodents chronically exposed to cocaine and other psychostimulants, display an increase in the density of “thin and immature” spines in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). In rodent models of PD, there is evidence that D2 dopamine receptor-containing MSNs are preferentially affected, while D1-positive cells are the main targets of increased spine density in models of addiction. However, such specificity remains to be established in primates. Although the link between the extent of striatal spine changes and the behavioral deficits associated with these disorders remains controversial, there is unequivocal evidence that glutamatergic synaptic transmission is significantly altered in both diseased conditions. Recent studies have suggested that opposite calcium-mediated regulation of the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) function induces these structural defects. In conclusion, there is strong evidence that dopamine is a major, but not the sole, regulator of striatal spine pathology in PD and addiction to psychostimulants. Further studies of the role of glutamate and other genes associated with spine plasticity in mediating these effects are warranted.

AB  - Abstract
Scratching inhibits pruritogen-evoked responses of neurons in the superficial dorsal horn, implicating a spinal site for scratch inhibition of itch. We investigated if scratching differentially affects neurons depending on whether they are activated by itchy vs. painful stimuli, and if the degree of inhibition depends on the relative location of scratching. We recorded from rat lumbar dorsal horn neurons responsive to intradermal (id) microinjection of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT). During the response to 5-HT, scratch stimuli (3 mm, 300 mN, 2 Hz, 20 s) were delivered at the injection site within the mechanosensitive receptive field (on-site), or 4–30 mm away, outside of the receptive field (off-site). During off-site scratching, 5-HT-evoked firing was significantly attenuated followed by recovery. On-site scratching excited neurons, followed by a significant post-scratch decrease in 5-HT-evoked firing. Most neurons additionally responded to mustard oil (allyl isothiocyanate). Off-site scratching had no effect, while on-site scratching excited the neurons. These results indicate that scratching exerts a state-dependent inhibitory effect on responses of spinal neurons to pruritic but not algesic stimuli. Moreover, on-site scratching first excited neurons followed by inhibition, while off-site scratching immediately evoked the inhibition of pruritogen-evoked activity. This accounts for the suppression of itch by scratching at a distance from the site of the itchy stimulus.

AB  - Abstract
Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) is a ubiquitous transcription factor that regulates immune and cell-survival signaling pathways. NF-κB has been reported to be present in neurons wherein it reportedly responds to immune and toxic stimuli, glutamate, and synaptic activity. However, because the brain contains many cell types, assays specifically measuring neuronal NF-κB activity are difficult to perform and interpret. To address this, we compared NF-κB activity in cultures of primary neocortical neurons, mixed brain cells, and liver cells, employing Western blot of NF-κB subunits, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) of nuclear κB DNA binding, reporter assay of κB DNA binding, immunofluorescence of the NF-κB subunit protein p65, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of NF-κB-regulated gene expression, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of produced proteins. Assay of p65 showed its constitutive presence in cytoplasm and nucleus of neurons at levels significantly lower than in mixed brain or liver cells. EMSA and reporter assays showed that constitutive NF-κB activity was nearly absent in neurons. Induced activity was minimal—many fold lower than in other cell types, as measured by phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitor IκBα, nuclear accumulation of p65, binding to κB DNA consensus sites, NF-κB reporting, or induction of NF-κB-responsive genes. The most efficacious activating stimuli for neurons were the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin-beta (IL-β). Neuronal NF-κB was not responsive to glutamate in most assays, and it was also unresponsive to hydrogen peroxide, lipopolysaccharide, norepinephrine, ATP, phorbol ester, and nerve growth factor. The chemokine gene transcripts CCL2, CXCL1, and CXCL10 were strongly induced via NF-κB activation by TNFα in neurons, but many candidate responsive genes were not, including the neuroprotective genes SOD2 and Bcl-xL. Importantly, the level of induced neuronal NF-κB activity in response to TNFα or any other stimulus was lower than the level of constitutive activity in non-neuronal cells, calling into question the functional significance of neuronal NF-κB activity.

AB  - Abstract
The olfacto-retinal centrifugal system, a constant component of the central nervous system that appears to exist in all vertebrate groups, is part of the terminal nerve (TN) complex. TN allows the integration of different sensory modalities, and its anatomic variability may have functional and evolutionary significance. We propose that the olfacto-retinal branch of TN is an important anatomical link that allows the functional interaction between olfactory and visual systems in Austrolebias. By injecting three different neuronal tracers (biocytin, horseradish peroxidase, and 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI)) in the left eye of Austrolebias charrua fishes, we identified the olfacto-retinal branch of TN and related neuronal somas that were differentiable by location, shape, and size. The olfacto-retinal TN branch is composed of numerous thin axons that run ventrally along the olfactory bulb (OB) and telencephalic lobes, and appears to originate from a group of many small monopolar neurons located in the rostral portion of both the ipsi- and contralateral OB (referred to as region 1). Labeled cells were found in two other regions: bipolar and multipolar neurons in the transition between the OB and telencephalic lobes (region 2) and two other groups in the preoptic/pretectal area (region 3). In this last region, the most rostral group is constituted by monopolar pear-shaped neurons and may belong to the septo-preoptic TN complex. The second group, putatively located in the pretectal region, is formed by pseudounipolar neurons and coincides with a conserved vertebrate nucleus of the centrifugal retinal system not involved in the TN complex. The found that connections between the olfactory and visual systems via the olfacto-retinal TN branch suggest an early interaction between these sensory modalities, and contribute to the identification of their currently unknown circuital organization.

AB  - Abstract
The expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is found in the pro-BDNF, truncated-BDNF and mature-BDNF isoforms, changes with learning. Mature-BDNF shows a peak of late expression in the hippocampus that is involved in the persistence of aversive memory in rodents. However, the role of BDNF in the hippocampal synaptic mechanisms involved in the classical conditioning aversive memory in birds still needs clarification. This study investigated the late expression of BDNF in the hippocampus and amygdala of pigeons trained with tone-shock conditioning and the effects of intra-hippocampal infusion of anisomycin (Ani) in these changes. Seven days after implantation of intra-hippocampal microcannulae, adult pigeons trained with three tone-shock pairings were assigned to one of three groups: Conditioning and Ani (CondANI), Conditioning and saline vehicle (CondSAL) and Conditioning only (Cond). NAIVE group had no treatment or conditioning. Homogenates of tissues from the hippocampus and amygdala, obtained 12 h after training, were used to determine the content of mature-BDNF, truncated-BDNF and pro-BDNF using Western blotting. Higher values for mature-BDNF than for truncated- and pro-BDNF content were seen in the hippocampus of Cond and CondSAL birds, but not in the hippocampus of CondANI or NAIVE birds (p &lt; 0.05). The values of mature-BDNF in the amygdala of all the three conditioned groups were higher than those observed for truncated- and pro-BDNF (p &lt; 0.05), which indicates that the activation of this protein in the amygdala was not affected by the infusion of Ani in the hippocampus. The data indicate that the tone-shock conditioning induced the activation of molecular pathways of BDNF in the hippocampus and amygdala of the pigeons. The decreases in the content of truncated- and pro-BDNF isoforms found in conditioned pigeons may suggest cleavage mechanisms induced by the training. Our data confirm previous observations of rodent studies and extend these observations to pigeons, revealing that, in spite of the anatomical differences between the hippocampus of rodents and pigeons, there are functional and molecular mechanisms that are conservative between the species.

AB  - Abstract
The present study was undertaken to investigate the relative contribution of cannabinoid receptors (CBRs) subtypes and to analyze cannabimimetic mechanisms involved in the inhibition of anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol degradation on the antihyperalgesic effect of ankle joint mobilization (AJM). Mice (25–35 g) were subjected to plantar incision (PI) and 24 h after surgery animals received the following treatments, AJM for 9 min, AEA (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal [i.p.]), WIN 55,212-2 (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.), URB937 (0.01–1 mg/kg, i.p.; a fatty acid amide hydrolase [FAAH] inhibitor) or JZL184 (0.016–16 mg/kg, i.p.; a monoacylglycerol lipase [MAGL] inhibitor). Withdrawal frequency to mechanical stimuli was assessed 24 h after PI and at different time intervals after treatments. Receptor specificity was investigated using selective CB1R (AM281) and CB2R (AM630) antagonists. In addition, the effect of the FAAH and MAGL inhibitors on the antihyperalgesic action of AJM was investigated. AJM, AEA, WIN 55,212-2, URB937 and JZL184 decreased mechanical hyperalgesia induced by PI. The antihyperalgesic effect of AJM was reversed by pretreatment with AM281 given by intraperitoneal and intrathecal routes, but not intraplantarly. Additionally, intraperitoneal and intraplantar, but not intrathecal administration of AM630 blocked AJM-induced antihyperalgesia. Interestingly, in mice pretreated with FAAH or the MAGL inhibitor the antihyperalgesic effect of AJM was significantly longer. This article presents data addressing the CBR mechanisms underlying the antihyperalgesic activity of joint mobilization as well as of the endocannabinoid catabolic enzyme inhibitors in the mouse postoperative pain model. Joint mobilization and these enzymes offer potential targets to treat postoperative pain.

AB  - Abstract
Responses during a simple reaction time task are influenced by temporal expectation, or the ability to anticipate when a stimulus occurs in time. Here, we test the hypothesis that prefrontal D1 dopamine signaling is necessary for temporal expectation during simple reaction time task performance. We depleted dopamine projections to the medial prefrontal circuits by infusing 6-hydroxidopamine, a selective neurotoxin, into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of rats, and studied their performance on a simple reaction time task with two delays. VTA dopamine depletion did not change movements or learning of the reaction time task. However, VTA dopamine-depleted animals did not develop delay-dependent speeding of reaction times, suggesting that mesocortical dopamine signaling is required for temporal expectation. Next, we manipulated dopamine signaling within the medial prefrontal cortex using local pharmacology. We found that SCH23390, a D1-type dopamine receptor antagonist, specifically attenuated delay-dependent speeding, while sulpiride, a D2-type receptor antagonist, did not. These data suggest that prefrontal D1 dopamine signaling is necessary for temporal expectation during performance of a simple reaction time task. Our findings provide insight into temporal processing of the prefrontal cortex, and how dopamine signaling influences prefrontal circuits that guide goal-directed behavior.

AB  - Abstract
Not only is the inferior colliculus (IC) a highly important center of integration within the central auditory pathway, but it may also play a modulatory role in sensory-motor circuitry. Previous evidence from our laboratory relating the IC to motor behavior shows that glutamate-mediated mechanisms within the IC modulate haloperidol-induced catalepsy. The high density of GABAergic receptors in the IC led to this study of a possible link between these receptors, haloperidol-induced catalepsy, and a possible involvement of the blockade of dopaminergic receptors. Catalepsy was evaluated by positioning both forepaws of rats on an elevated horizontal wooden bar and recording the time that the animal maintained this position. The present study shows that haloperidol-induced catalepsy was enhanced by local microinjection into the IC of midazolam (20 nmol/0.5 μl), a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, whereas animals receiving a microinjection of bicuculline (40 or 80 ng/0.5 μl), a GABAergic antagonist, showed a reduction in the time of catalepsy. However, the microinjection of haloperidol (2.5 or 5.0 μg/0.5 μl) bilaterally into the IC did not induce catalepsy. Therefore, our results suggest the involvement of the IC in the modulation of catalepsy induced by haloperidol, even though the dopaminergic mechanisms of the IC are unable to induce catalepsy when blocked by the direct microinjection of haloperidol. It is thus possible that the IC plays a role in sensorimotor gating and that GABA-mediated mechanisms are involved.

Food hoarding, especially scatter hoarding and retrieving food caches, requires spatial learning and memory and is an adaptive behavior important for an animal’s survival and reproductive success. In the present study, we examined the effects of hoarding behavior on cell proliferation and survival in the hippocampus of male and female Siberian chipmunks (Tamias sibiricus). We found that chipmunks in a semi-natural enclosure displayed hoarding behavior with large individual variations. Males ate more scatter-hoarded seeds than females. In addition, the display of hoarding behavior was associated with increased cell proliferation in the hippocampus and this increase occurred in a brain region-specific manner. These data provide further evidence to support the notion that new cells in the adult hippocampus are affected by learning and memory tasks and may play an important role in adaptive behavior.

AB  - AbstractIntroduction
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) remains the leading cause of infant mortality in Western societies. A prior study identified an association between hearing suppression on the newborn hearing test and subsequent death from SIDS. This is the first finding of an abnormality in SIDS cases prior to death. A following study identified that inner ear dysfunction precipitates a marked suppression of the hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR). Failure of arousal has been proposed to be a key component in SIDS. The objective of the present study was to assess whether inner ear dysfunction not only weakens the hypercapnic response, but also plays a role in suppressing the arousal response to suffocating gas mixtures.
Methods
Wild-type mice (n = 28) received intra-tympanic gentamicin (IT-Gent) injections bilaterally or unilaterally to precipitate inner ear hair cell dysfunction. Three control groups (n = 22) received intra-tympanic saline (IT-Saline) bilaterally or unilaterally (right or left), or intra-peritoneal gentamicin (IP-Gent). The body movement arousal responses to severe hypoxia–hypercarbia combined (5% CO2 in nitrogen) were tested under light anesthesia 8 days following the administration of gentamicin or saline.
Results
After injections, the bilateral and unilateral IT-Gent-treated animals behaved similarly to controls, however the HCVR as well as the arousal movements in response to severe hypoxia–hypercarbia were suppressed in IT-Gent-treated animals compared to control animals (P &lt; 0.05). Thus the HCVR was significantly decreased in the bilateral (n = 9) and unilateral IT-Gent-treated mice (n = 19) compared to bilateral (n = 7) and unilateral IT-Saline (n = 9) control groups (p &lt; 0.05). Arousal movements were suppressed in the bilateral IT-Gent group (n = 9) compared to bilateral IT-Saline controls (n = 7, P &lt; 0.0001) and in the unilateral IT-Gent group (n = 19) compared to unilateral IT-Saline controls (n = 10, P &lt; 0.0001).
Discussion
The findings support the theory that inner ear dysfunction could be relevant in the pathophysiology of SIDS. The inner ear appears to play a key role in arousal from suffocating gas mixtures that has not been previously identified.

AB  - Abstract
Presynaptic functions of the mammalian central neurons are regulated by a network of protein interactions. Synaptic vesicle recycling in and neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic nerve terminals are altered when a glutamate-deleting mutation is present in the torsinA protein (ΔE-torsinA). This mutation is linked with a hereditary form of the movement disorder dystonia known as DYT1 dystonia. Although torsinA expression is prevalent throughout the central nervous system, its subcellular localization – in particular with respect to presynaptic nerve terminals – remains unclear. This information would be useful in narrowing down possible models for how wild-type torsinA affects presynaptic function, as well as the nature of the presynaptic dysfunction that arises in the context of ΔE-torsinA mutation. Here we report on an analysis of the presynaptic localization of torsinA in cultured neurons obtained from a knock-in mouse model of DYT1 dystonia. Primary cultures of neurons were established from heterozygous and homozygous ΔE-torsinA knock-in mice, as well as from their wild-type littermates. Neurons were obtained from the striatum, cerebral cortex and hippocampus of these mice, and were subjected to immunocytochemistry. This analysis revealed the expression of both proteins in the somata and dendrites. However, neither the nerve terminals nor axonal shafts were immunoreactive. These results were confirmed by fluorogram-based quantitation. Our findings indicate that neither the wild-type nor the ΔE-torsinA mutant protein is present at substantial levels in the presynaptic structures of cultured neurons. Thus, the effects of torsinA, in wild-type and mutant forms, appear to influence presynaptic function indirectly, without residing in presynaptic structures.

AB  - Abstract
Indirect evidence suggests the increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in migraine pathophysiology. In the current study we measured lipid peroxidation product in the rat cortex, trigeminal ganglia and meninges after the induction of cortical spreading depression (CSD), a phenomenon known to be associated with migraine aura, and tested nociceptive firing triggered by ROS in trigeminal nerves ex vivo. Application of KCl to dura mater in anesthetized rats induced several waves of CSD recorded by an extracellular electrode in the cortex. Following CSD, samples of cortex (affected regions were identified with blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)), meninges from left and right hemispheres and trigeminal ganglia were taken for biochemical analysis. We found that CSD increased the level of the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex and meninges, but also in both ipsi- and contralateral trigeminal ganglia. In order to test the pro-nociceptive action of ROS, we applied the mild oxidant hydrogen peroxide to isolated rat hemiskull preparations including preserved trigeminal innervations. Application of hydrogen peroxide to meninges transiently enhanced electrical spiking activity of trigeminal nerves showing a pro-nociceptive action of ROS. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide trigeminal nerves still responded to capsaicin by burst of spiking activity indicating integrity of neuronal structures. The action of hydrogen peroxide was mediated by TRPA1 receptors as it was abolished by the specific TRPA1 antagonist TCS-5861528. Using dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons as test system we found that hydrogen peroxide promoted the release of the migraine mediator calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which we previously identified as a trigger of delayed sensitization of trigeminal neurons. Our data suggest that, after CSD, oxidative stress spreads downstream within the trigeminal nociceptive system and could be involved in the coupling of CSD with the activation of trigeminovascular system in migraine pathology.

AB  - Abstract
We have previously shown that chloride ion flux plays an important role in receptor tyrosine kinase A (TrkA)-mediated signaling pathway during nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced differentiation in pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Here we found out that chloride channel 4 (CLC-4) is responsible for the NGF-induced neurite outgrowth in neuronal cells. Using a patch-clamp technique, we found that NGF treatment increased anionic conductance in PC12 cells, an effect which was blocked by transfection of siRNA of CLC-4. Also, the NGF-induced TrkA phosphorylation and subsequent Akt/moesin phosphorylation was suppressed in the CLC-4 knock down cells. Moreover, CLC-4 knock down also suppressed the neurite outgrowth in response to long-term treatment of NGF in PC12 cells and in primary cortical neurons. In summary, our results suggest that CLC-4 is an important mediator of the TrkA-mediated signaling pathway and thus, the NGF-induced differentiation of neuronal cells.

AB  - Abstract
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease which causes inflammation, demyelination, and axonal injury. Currently, there is no cure for the disease. The endocannabinoid system has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic target for MS. The protective mechanisms of cannabinoids are thought to be mediated by the activation of the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) and type 2 (CB2) receptors expressed primarily in neurons and immune cells, respectively. However, the molecular mechanisms and the contribution of each receptor in ameliorating disease progression are still debatable. Although CB1 and CB2 receptors are expressed in oligodendrocytes, the myelin producing cells in the central nervous system, the role of cannabinoids in oligodendrocyte survival has not been well investigated. Using primary cultures of mature oligodendrocytes, we tested the effect of a novel synthetic cannabinoid CB52 on oligodendrocyte toxicity induced by peroxynitrite, the primary toxic species released by microglia. Interestingly, we found that CB52 is more potent than a number of broad and selective CB1 and CB2 agonists in protecting oligodendrocytes against peroxynitrite-induced toxicity. The protection provided by CB52 is likely due to its reduction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in these cells. Using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, we found that CB52 reduces microglia activation, nitrotyrosine formation, T cell infiltration, oligodendrocyte toxicity, myelin loss and axonal damage in the mouse spinal cord white matter and alleviates the clinical scores when given either before or after disease onset. These effects are reversed by the CB1 receptor antagonist, but not by the CB2 receptor antagonist, suggesting that the activation of CB1 receptors contributes significantly to the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of cannabinoids on MS.

AB  - Abstract
The neurobiological mechanisms of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) when applied for neuropathic pain are still incompletely known. Previous research indicates that brainstem circuitry is pivotal for the SCS effect. The present study aims at exploring the possible contribution to the SCS effects of the pain controlling system emanating from the locus coeruleus (LC) in the brain stem. Experiments were performed on the rat-spared nerve injury pain model. After evaluation of the attenuation of mechanical hypersensitivity induced by SCS, the effects of SCS on neuronal activity in the LC and on the noradrenaline (NA) content in the dorsal spinal cord were analyzed. SCS produced a significant increase in the discharge rate of LC neurons only in rats behaviorally responding to SCS as compared to non-responding and control animals. The NA content in the dorsal quadrant of the spinal cord ipsilateral to the nerve injury was analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in responding, non-responding and intact control rats both immediately following SCS and without SCS. No differences were found between these groups. In awake animals, lidocaine silencing of the ipsilateral LC or blocking of spinal noradrenergic system by intrathecal administration of α1,2 adrenoceptor antagonists failed to influence the antihypersensitivity effect of SCS. The present results indicate that the SCS-induced control of hypersensitivity in an experimental animal model of peripheral neuropathic pain may not be explained by the activation of direct spinal projections of noradrenergic LC neurons, while supraspinal projections of LC neurons still may play a role in the SCS effect.

AB  - Abstract
Does skill with a difficult task, such as tightrope walking, lead to improved balance through altered movement strategies or through altered weighting of sensory inputs? We approached this question by comparing tandem stance (TS) data between seven tightrope walkers and 12 untrained control subjects collected under different sensory conditions.

All subjects performed four TS tasks with eyes open or closed, on a normal firm or foam surface (EON, ECN, EOF, ECF); tightrope walkers were also tested on a tightrope (EOR). Head, upper trunk and pelvis angular velocities were measured with gyroscopes in pitch and roll. Power spectral densities (PSDs) ratios, and transfer function gains (TFG) between these body segments were calculated. Center of mass (CoM) excursions and its virtual time to contact a virtual base of support boundary (VTVBS) were also estimated.

Gain nonlinearities, in the form of decreased trunk to head and trunk to pelvis PSD ratios and TFGs, were present with increasing sensory task difficulty for both groups. PSD ratios and TFGs were less in trained subjects, though, in absolute terms, trained subjects moved their head, trunk, pelvis and CoM faster than controls, and had decreased VTVBS. Head roll amplitudes were unchanged with task or training, except above 3 Hz. CoM amplitude deviations were not less for trained subjects. For the trained subjects, EOR measures were similar to those of ECF.

Training standing on a tightrope induces a velocity modification of the same TS movement strategy used by untrained controls. More time is spent exploring the limits of the base of support with an increased use of fast trunk movements to control balance. Our evidence indicates an increased reliance on neck and pelvis proprioceptive inputs. The similarity of TS on foam to that on the tightrope suggests that the foam tasks are useful for effective training of tightrope walking.

AB  - Abstract
Astrocytes are plastic cells that play key roles in brain physiology and pathology, including via their glutamate transporters, excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT)1 and EAAT2, maintaining low extracellular glutamate concentrations and protecting against excitotoxic neuronal injury. Alterations in cell surface expression of EAATs and astrocytic cytoskeleton are important for regulating transporter activity. This study employed the actions of rottlerin, to interrogate the regulation of EAAT activity, expression and localization, and interfaces with Na+/K+-ATPase and astrocytic morphology. EAAT activity and expression were determined in primary cultures of mouse astrocytes in the presence of and after rottlerin removal, with or without trafficking inhibitors, using uptake ([3H]d-aspartate, 86Rb+) and molecular analyses. Astrocytic morphology and EAAT localization were investigated using Western blotting and immunocytochemistry, in concert with image analysis of glial fibrillary acidic protein, F-actin and EAAT1/2. Rottlerin induced a time-dependent inhibition of glutamate transport (Vmax). Rapid changes in cytoskeletal arrangement were observed and immunoblotting revealed increases in EAAT2 total and cell surface expression, despite reduced EAAT activity. Rottlerin-induced inhibition was reversible and its rate was increased by monensin co-treatment. Rottlerin inhibited, while monensin stimulated Na+/K+-ATPase. Removal of rottlerin rapidly elevated Na+/K+-ATPase activity beyond control levels, while co-treatment with monensin failed to stimulate the Na+/K+-ATPase. These data reveal inhibition of EAAT activity by rottlerin is not associated with loss of EAATs at the cell surface, but rather linked to cytoskeletal rearrangement, and inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase. Rapid recovery of Na+/K+-ATPase activity, and subsequent restoration of glutamate uptake indicates that astrocytic morphology and EAAT activity are co-regulated by a tightly coupled, homeostatic relationship between l-glutamate uptake, the electrochemical gradient and the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase.

AB  - Abstract
In rodents, olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) results in several behavioral and biochemical changes, useful as a screening model for antidepressants. Recent evidences suggest that quercetin; a bioflavonoid exhibits a variety of behavioral effects including anxiolytic, antidepressant, etc. Since microglia are commonly implicated in the neuroinflammation cascade of depression, we hypothesized that quercetin might involve microglial inhibition pathway in its antidepressant-like effects. To support such a possibility, we investigated the interaction of quercetin with a known microglial inhibitor (minocycline) against OBX-induced depression in male Wistar rats. In our study, ablation of olfactory bulbs caused hyperactivity in open field arena and increased immobility time in forced swim test (FST) which was coupled with enhanced serum corticosterone levels. Additionally, there were increased oxidative–nitrosative stress markers, inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)) along with enhanced apoptotic factor (caspase-3) in both cerebral cortex and hippocampal brain regions of OBX animals. These results were further supported by reports from histopathological analysis. After a surgical recovery period of 2 weeks, treatment with quercetin (40, 80 mg/kg; per oral (p.o.) p.o., 14 days) significantly prevented OBX-induced behavioral, biochemical, molecular and histopathological alterations. Further, combination of sub effective doses of quercetin (20, 40 mg/kg; p.o.) with minocycline (25 mg/kg; p.o.) significantly potentiated their protective effects as compared to their effects alone. Based on our results, we propose that microglial inhibitory pathway might be involved in the neuroprotective effects of quercetin and suppression of oxidative–nitrosative stress mediated neuroinflammation-apoptotic cascade associated with OBX rat model of depression.

AB  - Abstract
The elongation of neuron is highly dependent on membrane trafficking. Brefeldin A (BFA)-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange protein 1 (BIG1) functions in the membrane trafficking between the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane. BFA, an uncompetitive inhibitor of BIG1 can inhibit neurite outgrowth and polarity development. In this study, we aimed to define the possible role of BIG1 in neurite development and to further investigate the potential mechanism. By immunostaining, we found that BIG1 was extensively colocalized with synaptophysin, a marker for synaptic vesicles in soma and partly in neurites. The amount of both protein and mRNA of BIG1 were up-regulated during rat brain development. BIG1 depletion significantly decreased the neurite length and inhibited the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (AKT). Inhibition of BIG1 guanine nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) activity by BFA or overexpression of the dominant-negative BIG1 reduced PI3K and AKT phosphorylation, indicating regulatory effects of BIG1 on PI3K–AKT signaling pathway is dependent on its GEF activity. BIG1 siRNA or BFA treatment also significantly reduced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. Overexpression of wild-type BIG1 significantly increased ERK phosphorylation, but the dominant-negative BIG1 had no effect on ERK phosphorylation, indicating the involvement of BIG1 in ERK signaling regulation may not be dependent on its GEF activity. Our result identified a novel function of BIG1 in neurite development. The newly recognized function integrates the function of BIG1 in membrane trafficking with the activation of PI3K–AKT and ERK signaling pathways which are critical in neurite development.

AB  - Abstract
Nerve growth factor (NGF) augments the excitability of isolated rat sensory neurons through activation of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) and its downstream sphingomyelin signaling cascade, wherein neutral sphingomyelinase(s) (nSMase), ceramide, and the atypical protein-kinase C (aPKC), protein-kinase M zeta (PKMζ), are key mediators. Here we examined these same receptor-pathways in vivo for their role in mechanical hyperalgesia from exogenous NGF. Mechanical sensitivity was tested by the number of paw withdrawals in response to 10 stimuli (PWF = n/10) by a 4-g von Frey hair (VFH, testing “allodynia”) and by 10 and 15 g VFHs (testing “hyperalgesia”). NGF (500 ng/10 μL) injected into the male rat’s plantar hind paw induced long-lasting ipsilateral mechanical hypersensitivity. Mechano-hypersensitivity, relative to baseline responses and to those of the contralateral paw, developed by 0.5–1.5 h and remained elevated at least for 21–24 h, Acute intraplantar pre-treatment with nSMase inhibitors, glutathione (GSH) or GW4869, prevented the acute hyperalgesia from NGF (at 1.5 h) but not that at 24 h. A single injection of N-acetyl sphingosine (C2-ceramide), simulating the ceramide produced by nSMase activity, induced ipsilateral allodynia that persisted for 24 h, and transient hyperalgesia that resolved by 2 h. Intraplantar injection of hydrolysis-resistant mPro-NGF, selective for the p75NTR over the tyrosine kinase (TrkA) receptor, gave very similar results to NGF and was susceptible to the same inhibitors. Hyperalgesia from both NGF and mPro-NGF was prevented by paw pre-injection with blocking antibodies to rat p75NTR receptor. Finally, intraplantar (1 day before NGF) injection of mPSI, the myristolated pseudosubstrate inhibitor of PKCζ/PKMζ, decreased the hyperalgesia resulting from NGF or C2-ceramide, although scrambled mPSI was ineffective. The findings indicate that mechano-hypersensitivity from peripheral NGF involves the sphingomyelin signaling cascade activated via p75NTR, and that a peripheral aPKC is essential for this sensitization.

AB  - Abstract
Pain has sensory-discriminative and emotional-affective dimensions. Recent studies show that the affective component can be assessed with a conditioned place avoidance (CPA) test. We hypothesized that systemic morphine before a post-conditioning test would more potently attenuate the affective aspect compared to the sensory component and that [d-Ala2-N-Me-Phe4, Gly-ol5]-enkephalin (DAMGO), a μ-selective opioid receptor agonist, injected into the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) would reduce established CPA. A rat model of inflammatory pain, produced by a complete Freund adjuvant (CFA) injection into the hind paw, was combined with a CPA test. Three experiments were performed on adult male Sprague–Dawley rats. Systemic morphine (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg) in Experiment 1, intrathecal (i.t.) morphine (2.5 μg/rat) in Experiment 2, and intra-CeA DAMGO (7.7–15.4 ng/0.4 μl) in Experiment 3 were given to CFA-injected rats (n = 6–8/group) prior to a post-conditioning test. Saline-injected rats were used as control. Time spent in a pain-paired compartment was recorded twice, before conditioning and after a post-conditioning test. Paw withdrawal latency (PWL) to a noxious thermal stimulus was measured before experiment at day-1 and after the post-conditioning test; hyperalgesia was defined as a decrease in PWL. The data showed that CFA-injected rats had significantly negative CPA compared to those of saline-injected rats (P &lt; 0.05). Low-dosage systemic morphine significantly (P &lt; 0.05) reduced CFA-induced CPA but had no effect on PWL. I.t. morphine did not inhibit the display of CPA but significantly increased PWL, suppressing hyperalgesia (P &lt; 0.05). Intra-CeA DAMGO significantly inhibited the display of CPA compared to saline (P &lt; 0.05) but had no effect on PWL. The data demonstrate that morphine attenuates the affective component more powerfully than it does the sensory and suggests that the sensory and the emotional-affective dimensions are underpinned by different mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated in the regulation of sleep. The perifornical-lateral hypothalamic area (PF-LHA) is a key wake-promoting region and contains neurons that are active during behavioral or cortical activation. Recently, we found higher levels of NO metabolites (NOx), an indirect measure of NO levels, in the PF-LHA during prolonged waking (SD). However, NO is highly reactive and diffuses rapidly and the NOx assay is not sensitive enough to detect rapid-changes in NO levels across spontaneous sleep-waking states. We used a novel Nafion®-modified Platinum (NF-PT) electrode for real-time detection of NO levels in the PF-LHA across sleep–wake cycles, dark–light phases, and during SD. Sprague–Dawley male rats were surgically prepared for chronic sleep–wake recording and implantation of NF-PT electrode into the PF-LHA. Electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), and electrochemical current generated by NF-PT electrode were continuously acquired for 5–7 days including one day with 3 h of SD. In the PF-LHA, NO levels exhibited a waking &gt; rapid eye movement (REM) &gt; non-rapid eye movement (nonREM) sleep pattern (0.56 ± 0.03 μM &gt; 0.47 ± 0.02 μM &gt; 0.42 ± 0.02 μM; p &lt; 0.01). NO levels were also higher during the dark- as compared to the light-phase (0.53 ± 0.03 μM vs. 0.44 ± 0.02 μM; p &lt; 0.01). NO levels increased during 3 h of SD as compared to undisturbed control (0.58 ± 0.04 μM vs. 0.47 ± 0.01 μM; p &lt; 0.05). The findings indicate that in the PF-LHA, NO is produced during behavioral or cortical activation. Since elevated levels of NO inhibits most of the PF-LHA neurons that are active during cortical activation, these findings support a hypothesis that NO produced in conjunction with the activation of PF-LHA neurons during waking/SD, inhibits the same neuronal population to promote sleep.

AB  - Abstract
In the present study, we investigated the possible role of the dorsal hippocampal (CA1) dopamine D1 receptors on scopolamine-induced amnesia as well as scopolamine state-dependent memory in adult male Wistar rats. Animals were bilaterally implanted with chronic cannulae in the CA1 regions of the dorsal hippocampus, trained in a step-through type inhibitory avoidance task, and tested 24 h after training for their step-through latency. Results indicated that pre-training or pre-test intra-CA1 administration of scopolamine (1.5 and 3 μg/rat) dose-dependently reduced the step-through latency, showing an amnestic response. The pre-training scopolamine-induced amnesia (3 μg/rat) was reversed by the pre-test administration of scopolamine, indicating a state-dependent effect. Similarly, the pre-test administration of dopamine D1 receptor agonist, 1-phenyl-7,8-dihydroxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine hydrochloride (SKF38393; 1, 2 and 4 μg/rat, intra-CA1), could significantly reverse the scopolamine-induced amnesia. Interestingly, administration of an ineffective dose of scopolamine (0.25 μg/rat, intra-CA1) before different doses of SKF38393, blocked the reversal effect of SKF38393 on the pre-training scopolamine-induced amnesia. Moreover, while the pre-test intra-CA1 injection of the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, R(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine hydrochloride (SCH23390; 0.1 and 0.5 μg/rat, intra-CA1), resulted in apparent memory impairment, microinjection of the same doses of this agent inhibited the scopolamine-induced state-dependent memory. These results indicate that the CA1 dopamine D1 receptors may potentially play an important role in scopolamine-induced amnesia as well as the scopolamine state-dependent memory. Furthermore, our results propose that dopamine D1 receptor agonist, SKF38393 reverses the scopolamine-induced amnesia via acetylcholine release and possibly through the activation of muscarinic receptors.

AB  - Abstract
Early blindness results in occipital cortex neurons responding to a wide range of auditory and tactile stimuli. These changes in tuning properties are accompanied by an extensive reorganization of the occipital cortex that includes alterations in anatomical structure, neurochemical and metabolic pathways. Although it has been established in animal models that neurochemical pathways are heavily affected by early visual deprivation, the effects of blindness on these pathways in humans is still not well characterized. Here, using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy in nine early blind and normally sighted subjects, we find that early blindness is associated with higher levels of creatine, choline and myo-Inositol and indications of lower levels of GABA within the occipital cortex. These results suggest that the cross-modal responses associated with early blindness may, at least in part, be driven by changes within occipital biochemical pathways.

AB  - Abstract
Microglia, the resident immune cells of the CNS, are known to respond to injuries, infection and inflammation in the CNS by producing proinflammatory cytokines and phagocytosing cell debris and pathogens. In this study, we investigated the expression pattern and role of dihydropyrimidinase-like 3 (Dpysl3), a member of collapsin response mediator protein family, on the inflammatory reaction of microglia. Microarray analysis comparing the global gene expression profile of ameboid and ramified microglia has shown that Dpysl3 is mainly expressed in ameboid microglia in the 5-day postnatal rat brain. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Dpysl3 was intensely expressed in ameboid microglial cells in the rat brain till postnatal 7th day and then gradually diminished in ramified microglia of 2 weeks postnatal rat brain. Further, in vitro analysis confirmed that Dpysl3 expression was induced in activated BV-2 microglia treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). It is well documented that microglial activation by LPS increased the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and proinflammatory cytokines through the activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) activity in BV-2 microglia. However, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Dpysl3 prevented the LPS-induced expression of iNOS and cytokines including interleukin-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha as well as nuclear translocation of NF-κB in microglia. Remarkably, knockdown of Dpysl3 inhibited the migration of activated microglia coupled with deranged actin filament configuration (as revealed by F-actin cytoskeleton expression) in lamellipodia projecting from the cells. Knockdown of Dpysl3 also inhibited the phagocytic ability of activated microglia. These findings suggest that knockdown of Dpysl3 can inhibit activation, migration and phagocytic capability of microglia and consequently reduce neuroinflammation.

AB  - Abstract
The neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) regulates rodent, primate and human social behaviors and stress responses. OT binding studies employing 125I-d(CH2)5-[Tyr(Me)2,Thr4,Tyr-NH29] ornithine vasotocin (125I-OTA), has been used to locate and quantify OT receptors (OTRs) in numerous areas of the rat brain. This ligand has also been applied to locating OTRs in the human brain. The results of the latter studies, however, have been brought into question because of subsequent evidence that 125I-OTA is much less selective for OTR vs. vasopressin receptors in the primate brain. Previously we used a monoclonal antibody directed toward a region of the human OTR to demonstrate selective immunostaining of cell bodies and fibers in the preoptic-anterior hypothalamic area and ventral septum of a cynomolgus monkey (Boccia et al., 2001). The present study employed the same monoclonal antibody to study the location of OTRs in tissue blocks containing cortical, limbic and brainstem areas dissected from fixed adult, human female brains. OTRs were visualized in discrete cell bodies and/or fibers in the central and basolateral regions of the amygdala, medial preoptic area (MPOA), anterior and ventromedial hypothalamus, olfactory nucleus, vertical limb of the diagonal band, ventrolateral septum, anterior cingulate and hypoglossal and solitary nuclei. OTR staining was not observed in the hippocampus (including CA2 and CA3), parietal cortex, raphe nucleus, nucleus ambiguus or pons. These results suggest that there are some similarities, but also important differences, in the locations of OTRs in human and rodent brains. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) utilizing a monoclonal antibody provides specific localization of OTRs in the human brain and thereby provides opportunity to further study OTR in human development and psychiatric conditions.

Numerous long-term studies have investigated the circadian clock system in mammals, which organizes physiological functions, including metabolism, digestion, and absorption of food, and energy expenditure. Food or nutrition can be a synchronizer for the circadian clock systems, as potent as the external light–dark signal can be. Recent studies have investigated different kinds of food, frequency of consumption, and time of consumption for optimizing body clock and ensuring healthy habits. In this review, we discuss recent studies investigating chronobiology and nutrition, and then summarize available information as “Chrono-nutrition” for the development of a new standardized research strategy.

AB  - Abstract
Cancer pain, particularly bone cancer pain, affects the quality of life of cancer patients, and current treatments are limited. Interleukin (IL)-33, a new member of the IL-1 super family, has been reported to be involved in the modulation of inflammatory pain. However, studies focused on its role in the modulation of cancer pain have been rare. The present study was designed to investigate whether spinal IL-33/ST2 signaling was involved in bone cancer-induced pain in mice. Bone cancer was induced via intra-femoral inoculation of 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells. The mice inoculated with carcinoma cells showed mechanical allodynia, heat hyperalgesia and a reduction in limb use, whereas phosphate-buffered saline or heat-killed cells-injected mice showed no significant difference compared to non-treated mice. The pain hypersensitive behaviors worsened over time and with bone destruction. Both the mRNA and the protein levels of IL-33 and relative cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-a) were significantly increased in the spinal cord after the inoculation of carcinoma cells. Intrathecal administration of ST2 antibody to block IL-33/ST2 signaling alleviated pain behaviors in a dose-dependent manner in bone cancer pain mice compared with vehicle-injected mice. Moreover, the ST2−/− mice showed a significant amelioration of limb use and heat hyperalgesia compared to wild-type mice. Meanwhile, concentrations of spinal IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-a in the cancer-bearing ST2−/− mice had no significant changes. These data further suggested that IL-33/ST2 signaling played a vital role in cancer pain. Our results provided evidence that IL-33 and its receptor ST2 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of pain in bone cancer patients.

AB  - Abstract
This study examined which brain regions are influenced by an inhibitory lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) mechanism that affects water intake. Controls and rats with bilateral LPBN lesions were administered angiotensin II (AngII) (0.5 mg/kg subcutaneous – SC), drinking responses measured, and brains processed for Fos-immunohistochemistry. A separate group of LPBN-lesioned and non-lesioned animals were denied water for 90 min prior to perfusion to remove any confounding factor of water intake. LPBN-lesioned rats drank a cumulative volume of 9 mL compared with &lt;4 mL by controls (p &lt; 0.01). Compared with sham-lesioned animals, Fos expression was attenuated in overdrinking LPBN-lesioned rats in the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO), paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), supraoptic nucleus (SON) (p &lt; 0.001), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and central nucleus of the amygdala (p &lt; 0.01). In LPBN-lesioned rats that did not drink, greater numbers of activated neurons were detected in the PVN (p &lt; 0.001), SON (p &lt; 0.01), MnPO, nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and area postrema (p &lt; 0.05) in response to SC AngII, compared with non-lesioned rats. These data suggest that the direct effects of LPBN lesions caused an increase in AngII-induced water intake and in rats that did not drink an increase in Fos expression, while indirect secondary effects of LPBN lesions caused a reduction in Fos expression possibly related to excessive ingestion of water. An inhibitory mechanism, likely related to arterial baroreceptor stimulation, relayed by neurons located in the LPBN influences the responses of the MnPO, PVN and SON to increases in peripheral AngII.

AB  - Abstract
Noradrenaline (NA) in the hippocampus plays an important role in memory function and has been shown to modulate different forms of synaptic plasticity. Oscillations in the gamma frequency (20–80 Hz) band in the hippocampus have also been proposed to play an important role in memory functions and, evidence from both in vitro and in vivo studies, has suggested this activity can be modulated by NA. However, the role of different NA receptor subtypes in the modulation of gamma frequency activity has not been fully elucidated. We have found that NA (30 μM) exerts a bidirectional control on the magnitude of kainate-evoked (50–200 nM) gamma frequency oscillations in the cornu Ammonis (CA3) region of the rat hippocampus in vitro via activation of different receptor subtypes. Activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors (α-AR) reduced the power of the gamma frequency oscillation. In contrast, activation of beta-adrenergic receptors (β-AR) caused an increase in the power of the gamma frequency oscillations. Using specific agonists and antagonists of AR receptor subtypes we demonstrated that these effects are mediated specifically via α1A-AR and β1-AR subtypes. NA activated both receptor subtypes, but the α1A-AR-mediated effect predominated, resulting in a reversible suppression of gamma frequency activity. These results suggest that NA is able to differentially modulate on-going gamma frequency oscillatory activity that could result in either increased or decreased information flow through the hippocampus.

AB  - Abstract
Neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes arise from CNS progenitor cells at defined times and locations during development, with transcription factors serving as key determinants of these different neural cell fates. An emerging theme is that the transcription factors that specify CNS cell fates function in a context-dependent manner, regulated by post-translational modifications and epigenetic alterations that partition the genome (and hence target genes) into active or silent domains. Here we profile the critical roles of the proneural genes, which encode basic-helix–loop–helix (bHLH) transcription factors, in specifying neural cell identities in the developing neocortex. In particular, we focus on the proneural genes Neurogenin 1 (Neurog1), Neurog2 and Achaete scute-like 1 (Ascl1), which are each expressed in a distinct fashion in the progenitor cell pools that give rise to all of the neuronal and glial cell types of the mature neocortex. Notably, while the basic functions of these proneural genes have been elucidated, it is becoming increasingly evident that tight regulatory controls dictate when, where and how they function. Current efforts to better understand how proneural gene function is regulated will not only improve our understanding of neocortical development, but are also critical to the future development of regenerative therapies for the treatment of neuronal degeneration or disease.

AB  - Abstract
Ghrelin is a stomach-derived peptide hormone that acts in the brain to regulate many important physiological functions. Ghrelin receptor, named the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), is present in many brain areas with or without obvious direct access to ghrelin circulating in the bloodstream. Ghrelin is also present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) but the brain targets of CSF ghrelin are unclear. Here, we studied which brain areas are accessible to ghrelin present in the CSF. For this purpose, we centrally injected mice with fluorescein-labeled ghrelin (F-ghrelin) peptide tracer and then systematically mapped the distribution of F-ghrelin signal through the brain. Our results indicated that centrally injected F-ghrelin labels neurons in most of the brain areas where GHSR is present. Also, we detected F-ghrelin uptake in the ependymal cells of both wild-type and GHSR-null mice. We conclude that CSF ghrelin is able to reach most of brain areas expressing GHSR. Also, we propose that the accessibility of CSF ghrelin to the brain parenchyma occurs through the ependymal cells in a GHSR-independent manner.

Intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) are composed of spatial components and time courses. The spatial components of ICNs were discovered with moderate-to-high reliability. So far as we know, few studies focused on the reliability of the temporal patterns for ICNs based their individual time courses. The goals of this study were twofold: to investigate the test–retest reliability of temporal patterns for ICNs, and to analyze these informative univariate metrics. Additionally, a correlation analysis was performed to enhance interpretability. Our study included three datasets: (a) short- and long-term scans, (b) multi-band echo-planar imaging (mEPI), and (c) eyes open or closed. Using dual regression, we obtained the time courses of ICNs for each subject. To produce temporal patterns for ICNs, we applied two categories of univariate metrics: network-wise complexity and network-wise low-frequency oscillation. Furthermore, we validated the test–retest reliability for each metric. The network-wise temporal patterns for most ICNs (especially for default mode network, DMN) exhibited moderate-to-high reliability and reproducibility under different scan conditions. Network-wise complexity for DMN exhibited fair reliability (ICC &lt; 0.5) based on eyes-closed sessions. Specially, our results supported that mEPI could be a useful method with high reliability and reproducibility. In addition, these temporal patterns were with physiological meanings, and certain temporal patterns were correlated to the node strength of the corresponding ICN. Overall, network-wise temporal patterns of ICNs were reliable and informative and could be complementary to spatial patterns of ICNs for further study.

AB  - Abstract
Microglia have been implicated in disease progression for several age-related brain disorders. However, while microglia’s contribution to the progression of these disorders is accepted, the effect of aging on their endogenous cellular characteristics has received limited attention. In fact, a comprehensive study of how the structure and function of microglia changes as a function of developmental age has yet to be performed. Here, we describe the functional response characteristics of primary microglial cultures prepared from embryonic, neonatal (Neo), 2–3 month-old, 6–8 month-old, 9–11 month-old, and 13–15 month-old rats. Microglial morphology, glutamate (GLU) uptake, and release of trophic and inflammatory factors were assessed under basal conditions and in microglia activated with adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) or lipopolysaccharide. We found that microglia from different age groups were both morphologically and functionally distinct. Upon activation by ATP, Neo microglia were the most reactive, upregulating nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-α, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor release as well as GLU uptake. This upregulation translated into neurotoxicity in microglia-neuron co-cultures that were not observed with microglia of different developmental ages. Interestingly, 13–15 month-old microglia exhibited similar activation profiles to Neo microglia, whereas microglia from younger adults and embryos were activated less by ATP. Our data also identify age-dependent differences in purinergic receptor subtype expression that contribute to the regulation of neuronal survival. Combined, our data demonstrate that microglial activation and purinergic receptor profiles vary non-linearly with developmental age, a potentially important finding for studies examining the role of microglia in neurodegenerative disorders.

The role of 5-HT receptors in fluoxetine-induced nociception and antinociception in rats was assessed. Formalin produced a typical pattern of flinching and licking/lifting behaviors. Local peripheral ipsilateral, but not contralateral, pre-treatment with fluoxetine (0.3–3 nmol/paw) increased in a dose-dependent fashion 0.5% formalin-induced nociception. In contrast, intrathecal pretreatment with fluoxetine (0.3–3 nmol/rat) prevented nociception induced by formalin. The peripheral pronociceptive effect of fluoxetine was prevented by the 5-HT2A (ketanserin, 3–10 pmol/paw), 5-HT2B (3-(2-[4-(4-fluorobenzoyl)-1-piperidinyl]ethyl)-2,4(1H,3H)-quinazolinedione(+) tartrate, RS-127445, 3–10 pmol/paw), 5-HT2C (8-[5-(2,4-dimethoxy-5-(4-trifluoromethylphenylsulphonamido) phenyl-5-oxopentyl]1,3,8-triazaspiro[4.5] decane-2,4-dione hydrochloride, RS-102221, 3–10 pmol/paw), 5-HT3 (ondansetron, 3–10 nmol/paw), 5-HT4 ([1-[2-methylsulphonylamino ethyl]-4-piperidinyl]methyl 1-methyl-1H-indole-3-carboxylate, GR-113808, 3–100 fmol/paw), 5-HT6 (4-iodo-N-[4-methoxy-3-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)phenyl]benzene-sulfonamide hydrochloride, SB-258585, 3–10 pmol/paw) and 5-HT7 ((R)-3-(2-(2-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl) ethyl) pyrrolidine-1-sulfonyl) phenol hydrochloride, SB-269970, 0.3–1 nmol/paw), but not by the 5-HT1A (N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-2-pyridinylcyclohexanecarboxamide maleate, WAY-100635, 0.3–1 nmol/paw), 5-HT1B/1D (N-[4-methoxy-3-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)phenyl]-2’-methyl-4’-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-1,1’-biphenyl-4-carboxamide hydrochloride hydrate, GR-127935, 0.3–1 nmol/paw), 5-HT1B (1’-methyl-5-[[2’-methyl-4’-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)biphenyl-4-yl]carbonyl]-2,3,6,7-tetrahydrospiro[furo[2,3-f]indole-3,4’-piperidine hydrochloride, SB-224289, 0.3–1 nmol/paw), 5-HT1D (4-(3-chlorophenyl)-α-(diphenylmethyl)-1-piperazineethanol hydrochloride, BRL-15572, 0.3–1 nmol/paw) nor 5-HT5A ((N-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-N-[[4’-[[(2-phenylethyl)amino]methyl][1,1’-biphenyl]-4-yl]methyl]cyclopentanepropanamide dihydrochloride, SB-699551, 1–3 nmol/paw), receptor antagonists. In marked contrast, the spinal antinociceptive effect of fluoxetine was prevented by the 5-HT1A (WAY-100635, 0.3–1 nmol/rat), 5-HT1B/1D (GR-127935, 0.3–1 nmol/rat), 5-HT1B (SB-224289, 0.3–1 nmol/rat), 5-HT1D (BRL-15572, 0.3–1 nmol/rat) and 5-HT5A (SB-699551, 1–3 nmol/rat), but not by the 5-HT2A (ketanserin, 3–10 pmol/rat), 5-HT2B (RS-127445, 3–10 pmol/rat), 5-HT2C (RS-102221, 3–10 pmol/rat), 5-HT3 (ondansetron, 3–10 nmol/rat), 5-HT4 (GR-113808, 3–100 fmol/rat), 5-HT6 (SB-258585, 3–10 pmol/rat) nor 5-HT7 (SB-269970, 0.3–1 nmol/rat), receptor antagonists. These results suggest that fluoxetine produces nociception at the periphery by activating peripheral 5-HT2A/2B/2C/3/4/6/7 receptors. In addition, intrathecal fluoxetine produces antinociception by activation of spinal 5-HT1A/1B/1D/5A receptors.

AB  - Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) is known to regulate important processes in neuronal cell development, activity and growth. It is associated with the structural stabilization of neuronal processes and synaptic contacts during the maturation of the central nervous system. The remodeling of the ECM during both development and after central nervous system injury has been shown to affect neuronal guidance, synaptic plasticity and their regenerative responses. Particular interest has focused on the inhibitory role of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and their formation into dense lattice-like structures, termed perineuronal nets (PNNs), which enwrap sub-populations of neurons and restrict plasticity. Recent studies in mammalian systems have implicated CSPGs and PNNs in regulating and restricting structural plasticity. The enzymatic degradation of CSPGs or destabilization of PNNs has been shown to enhance neuronal activity and plasticity after central nervous system injury. This review focuses on the role of the ECM, CSPGs and PNNs; and how developmental and pharmacological manipulation of these structures have enhanced neuronal plasticity and aided functional recovery in regeneration, stroke, and amblyopia. In addition to CSPGs, this review also points to the functions and potential therapeutic value of these and several other key ECM molecules in epileptogenesis and dementia.

While considerable effort has been made to investigate the neural mechanisms of pain, much less effort has been devoted to itch, at least until recently. However, itch is now gaining increasing recognition as a widespread and costly medical and socioeconomic issue. This is accompanied by increasing interest in the underlying neural mechanisms of itch, which has become a vibrant and rapidly-advancing field of research. The goal of the present forefront review is to describe the recent progress that has been made in our understanding of itch mechanisms.

Certain patterns of neural activity can induce N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR)-dependent synaptic plasticity, one of the important foundations of memory. Here, we report that a patterned high-frequency stimulation (PHS) induces rat hippocampal long-term depression (LTD) in an NMDAR-independent manner that requires coactivation of GABAARs and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), and endocytosis of AMPARs. Thus, we disclose that a patterned high-frequency stimulation triggers GABAAR and mAChR-dependent LTD in the hippocampus.

AB  - Abstract
Understanding the endogenous survival pathways induced by ischemic tolerance may yield targets for neuroprotection from stroke. One well-studied pathway reported to be evoked by preconditioning stimuli is the transcription factor HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor). However, whether HIF induction by ischemic insults is neuroprotective or toxic is still unclear. We examined the ability of three prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitors, which induce HIF, to protect hippocampal cultures from oxygen–glucose deprivation.

Hippocampal cultures were exposed to ischemic preconditioning or various concentrations of cobalt chloride, deferoxamine (DFO) or dimethyloxylalyglycine (DMOG), prior to lethal oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD). Cell survival of neurons and astrocytes was determined with dual-label immunocytochemistry. The induction of HIF targets was assessed in mixed as well as astrocyte-enriched cultures. Ischemic preconditioning, as well as low concentrations of cobalt and DFO, enhanced the survival of neurons following OGD. However, DMOG exacerbates OGD-induced neuronal death. At low concentrations, all three prolyl-hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitors increased the survival of astrocytes. Neuroprotective concentrations of cobalt induced the transcription of the cytokine erythropoietin (EPO) in astrocyte cultures. In addition, pretreatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rH-EPO) also protected neurons from OGD.

Our data suggest that HIF-induced EPO, released from astrocytes, protects neurons from OGD. However, the three PHD inhibitors each exhibited different neuroprotective profiles at low concentrations, suggesting that not all PHD inhibitors are created equal. The protective effects at low doses is reminiscent of HIF involvement in ischemic tolerance, in which sub-lethal insults induce HIF pathways resulting in neuroprotection, whereas the high-dose toxicity suggests that over-activation of HIF is not always protective. Therefore, the choice of inhibitor and dose may determine the clinical utility of these compounds. Deferoxamine exhibited little toxicity even at higher doses, and therefore appears a promising candidate for clinical use.

AB  - Abstract
The cytoarchitecturally-homogeneous appearance of the globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra has long been said to imply a high degree of afferent convergence and sharing of inputs by nearby neurons. Moreover, axon collaterals of neurons in the external segment of the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata arborize locally and make inhibitory synapses on other cells of the same type. These features suggest that the connectivity of the basal ganglia may impose spike-time correlations among the cells, and it has been puzzling that experimental studies have failed to demonstrate such correlations. One possible solution arises from studies of firing patterns in basal ganglia cells, which reveal that they are nearly all pacemaker cells. Their high rate of firing does not depend on synaptic excitation, but they fire irregularly because a dense barrage of synaptic inputs normally perturbs the timing of their autonomous activity. Theoretical and computational studies show that the responses of repetitively-firing neurons to shared input or mutual synaptic coupling often defy classical intuitions about temporal synaptic integration. The patterns of spike-timing among such neurons depend on the ionic mechanism of pacemaking, the level of background uncorrelated cellular and synaptic noise, and the firing rates of the neurons, as well as the properties of their synaptic connections. Application of these concepts to the basal ganglia circuitry suggests that the connectivity and physiology of these nuclei may be configured to prevent the establishment of permanent spike-timing relationships between neurons. The development of highly synchronous oscillatory patterns of activity in Parkinson’s disease may result from the loss of pacemaking by some basal ganglia neurons, and accompanying breakdown of the mechanisms responsible for active decorrelation.

AB  - Abstract
Long-lasting pain may partly be a consequence of ongoing neuroinflammation, in which astrocytes play a significant role. Following noxious stimuli, increased inflammatory receptor activity, influences in Na+/K+-ATPase activity and actin filament organization occur within the central nervous system. In astrocytes, the Ca2+ signaling system, Na+ transporters, cytoskeleton, and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines change during inflammation. The aim of this study was to restore these cell parameters in inflammation-reactive astrocytes. We found that the combination of (1) endomorphin-1, an opioid agonist that stimulates the Gi/o protein of the μ-opioid receptor; (2) naloxone, an opioid antagonist that inhibits the Gs protein of the μ-opioid receptor at ultralow concentrations; and (3) levetiracetam, an anti-epileptic agent that counteracts the release of IL-1β, managed to activate the Gi/o protein and Na+/K+-ATPase activity, inhibit the Gs protein, and decrease the release of IL-1β. The cell functions of astrocytes in an inflammatory state were virtually restored to their normal non-inflammatory state and it could be of clinical significance and may be useful for the treatment of long-term pain.

AB  - Abstract
Decades of clinical and basic research indicate significant links between altered hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA)-axis hormone dynamics and major depressive disorder (MDD). Recent neuroimaging studies of MDD highlight abnormalities in stress response circuitry regions which play a role in the regulation of the HPA-axes. However, there is a dearth of research examining these systems in parallel, especially as related to potential trait characteristics. The current study addresses this gap by investigating neural responses to a mild visual stress challenge with real-time assessment of adrenal hormones in women with MDD in remission and controls. Fifteen women with recurrent MDD in remission (rMDD) and 15 healthy control women were scanned on a 3T Siemens MR scanner while viewing neutral and negative (stress-evoking) stimuli. Blood samples were obtained before, during, and after scanning for the measurement of HPA-axis hormone levels. Compared to controls, rMDD women demonstrated higher anxiety ratings, increased cortisol levels, and hyperactivation in the amygdala and hippocampus, p &lt; 0.05, family-wise error (FWE)-corrected in response to the stress challenge. Among rMDD women, amygdala activation was negatively related to cortisol changes and positively associated with the duration of remission. Findings presented here provide evidence for differential effects of altered HPA-axis hormone dynamics on hyperactivity in stress response circuitry regions elicited by a well-validated stress paradigm in women with recurrent MDD in remission.

AB  - Abstract
Neurons at higher stations of each sensory system are responsive to feature combinations not present at lower levels. As a result, the activity of these neurons becomes less redundant than lower levels. We recorded responses to speech sounds from the inferior colliculus and the primary auditory cortex neurons of rats, and tested the hypothesis that primary auditory cortex neurons are more sensitive to combinations of multiple acoustic parameters compared to inferior colliculus neurons. We independently eliminated periodicity information, spectral information and temporal information in each consonant and vowel sound using a noise vocoder. This technique made it possible to test several key hypotheses about speech sound processing. Our results demonstrate that inferior colliculus responses are spatially arranged and primarily determined by the spectral energy and the fundamental frequency of speech, whereas primary auditory cortex neurons generate widely distributed responses to multiple acoustic parameters, and are not strongly influenced by the fundamental frequency of speech. We found no evidence that inferior colliculus or primary auditory cortex was specialized for speech features such as voice onset time or formants. The greater diversity of responses in primary auditory cortex compared to inferior colliculus may help explain how the auditory system can identify a wide range of speech sounds across a wide range of conditions without relying on any single acoustic cue.

Focal cortical injuries are well known to cause changes in function and excitability of the surviving cortical areas but the cellular correlates of these physiological alterations are not fully understood. In the present study we employed a well established ex vivo–in vitro model of focal laser lesions in the rat visual cortex and we studied membrane and firing properties of the surviving layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. Patch-clamp recordings, performed in the first week post-injury, revealed an increased input resistance, a depolarized spike threshold as well as alterations in the firing pattern of neurons in the cortex ipsilateral to the lesion. Notably, the reported lesion-induced alterations emerged or became more evident when an exciting perfusing solution, known as modified artificial cerebrospinal fluid, was used to increase the ongoing synaptic activity in cortical slices. Conversely, application of glutamatergic or GABAA receptor blockers reduced the observed alterations and GABAB receptor blockers abolished the differences completely. All together the present findings suggest that changes in synaptic receptors function, following focal cortical injuries, can modulate membrane and firing properties of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. This previously unknown functional interplay between synaptic and membrane properties may constitute a novel cellular mechanism to explain alterations in neuronal network function and excitability following focal cortical injuries.

AB  - Abstract
β-Amyloid (Aβ) peptides are derived from the sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). They are enriched in plaques present in Alzheimer’s brains and thus play important roles in the pathogenesis of this disease. APP is also known to be expressed in the neurons of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and contributes to neuronal survival and axonal growth during development. However, whether APP and Aβ peptides are involved in nociception and pathological pain states is mostly unknown. In the present study, we have used behavioral, biochemical and morphological approaches to address this issue in both adult rats and APP over-expressing CRND8 transgenic mice. We observed that the Aβ peptide (17–24) was predominantly expressed in small-sized DRG neurons of rats. Following intraplantar (i.pl.) injection of complete Freud’s adjuvant (CFA), the levels of APP and Aβ peptides were significantly reduced in the ipsilateral lumbar 4–6 rat DRG. In 3-, 12- and 24-month-old CRND8 mice, pain sensitivity in response to heat and mechanical stimulation was significantly dampened compared to their age-matched wild-type littermates. In parallel with reduced pain sensitivity, the expression of pain mediators such as substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide and transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 was significantly reduced in L4–6 DRG of CRND8 mice. Although i.pl. injection of CFA induced a rather similar pattern of inflammatory pain in 3-month-old CRND8 mice and their wild-type littermates, recovery from inflammatory pain seemed faster in 12-month-old CRND8 mice than wild-type mice. These findings suggest that APP and Aβ peptides suppress both nociception and inflammatory pain and are likely involved in blunt pain perception of Alzheimer’s patients in clinical settings.

AB  - Abstract
The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) contains the presympathetic neurons involved in cardiovascular regulation that has been implicated as one of the most important central sites for the antihypertensive action of moxonidine (an α2-adrenergic and imidazoline agonist). Here, we sought to evaluate the cardiovascular effects produced by moxonidine injected into another important brainstem site, the commissural nucleus of the solitary tract (commNTS). Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), splanchnic sympathetic nerve activity (sSNA) and activity of putative sympathoexcitatory vasomotor neurons of the RVLM were recorded in conscious or urethane-anesthetized, and artificial ventilated male Wistar rats. In conscious or anesthetized rats, moxonidine (2.5 and 5 nmol/50 nl) injected into the commNTS reduced MAP, HR and sSNA. The injection of moxonidine into the commNTS also elicited a reduction of 28% in the activity of sympathoexcitatory vasomotor neurons of the RVLM. To further assess the notion that moxonidine could act in another brainstem area to elicit the antihypertensive effects, a group with electrolytic lesions of the commNTS or sham and with stainless steel guide-cannulas implanted into the 4th V were used. In the sham group, moxonidine (20 nmol/1 μl) injected into 4th V decreased MAP and HR. The hypotension but not the bradycardia produced by moxonidine into the 4th V was reduced in acute (1 day) commNTS-lesioned rats. These data suggest that moxonidine can certainly act in other brainstem regions, such as commNTS to produce its beneficial therapeutic effects, such as hypotension and reduction in sympathetic nerve activity.

The role of spinal cannabinoid systems in neuropathic pain of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice was studied. In normal mice, injection of the cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN-55,212-2 (1 and 3 μg, i.t.) dose-dependently prolonged the tail-flick latency, whereas there were no changes with the injection of either cannabinoid CB1 (AM 251, 1 μg, i.t.) or CB2 (AM 630, 4 μg, i.t.) receptor antagonists. AM 251 (1 μg, i.t.), but not AM 630 (4 μg, i.t.), significantly inhibited the prolongation of the tail-flick latency induced by WIN-55,212-2 (3 μg, i.t.). In STZ-induced diabetic mice, the tail-flick latency was significantly shorter than that in normal mice. A low dose of WIN-55,212-2 (1 μg, i.t.) significantly recovered the tail-flick latency in STZ-induced diabetic mice. The effect of WIN-55,212-2 (1 μg, i.t.) in STZ-induced diabetic mice was significantly inhibited by AM 630 (4 μg, i.t.), but not AM 251 (1 μg). The selective cannabinoid CB2 receptor agonist L-759,656 (19 and 38 μg, i.t.) also dose-dependently recovered the tail-flick latency in STZ-induced diabetic mice, and this recovery was inhibited by AM 630 (4 μg, i.t.). The protein levels of cannabinoid CB1 receptors, CB2 receptors and diacylglycerol lipase α (DGL-α), the enzyme that synthesizes endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol, in the spinal cord were examined using Western blotting. The protein levels of both cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors were increased in STZ-induced diabetic mice, whereas the protein level of DGL-α was significantly decreased. These results indicate that spinal cannabinoid systems are changed in diabetic mice and suggest that cannabinoid CB2 receptor agonists might have an ability to recover diabetic neuropathic pain.

AB  - Abstract
This review evaluates and contextualizes the behavioral studies undertaken on cetaceans in terms of the relationship of these behaviors to special levels of intelligence associated with these marine mammals and the evolution of their relatively and absolutely large brain size. Many believe that the large size of the cetacean brain and reported behaviors indicate the need to create a special status for these animals in terms of their intellect, positing that they are second to humans in terms of general intelligence. Cetacean brains became relatively large approximately 32 million years ago, at the Archaeocete–Neocete faunal transition, and have since remained stable in relative size. The behaviors reported for modern cetaceans are thought to parallel those of great apes, to the exclusion of other mammals. By creating an autocatalytic model of cetacean brain evolution, the behaviors thought to be indicative of sophisticated cognitive processes can be assessed as to their potential involvement in the evolution of larger brains in cetaceans. By contextualizing these behaviors in a broader comparative framework, and not the limited cetacean – great ape comparisons mostly used, it is evident that the behaviors used to argue for high levels of intelligence in cetaceans are found commonly across mammals and other vertebrates, and are often observed in invertebrates. This contextualization indicates that cetacean intelligence is qualitatively no different to other vertebrates. In addition, the inability of cetaceans to surpass Piaget stage 4/5 on object permanence tests and to solve an “if and only if, then” abstract task indicates the possibility that their levels of general intelligence may be less than that seen in other vertebrates. Sophisticated cognitive abilities appear to play no role in the evolution of large brain size in cetaceans, indicating that alternative theories of large brain size evolution in cetaceans should be considered in more detail.

AB  - Abstract
Compression of spinal roots is an important medical problem, which may arise from intervertebral disc herniation, tumor growth or as a result of high energy accidents. Differently from avulsion, root crushing maintains the central/peripheral nervous system (CNS/PNS) connection, although the axons are axotomized and motoneurons degenerate. Such neuronal death may decrease and delay motor function recovery. In the present study we have investigated the neuroprotective effects of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy following such proximal lesions. Motor recovery and synaptic stabilization were analyzed by the use of morphological and functional approaches. For that, crushing the ventral roots at L4, L5 and L6 was unilaterally performed in Lewis rats. Four weeks after injury, an increased motoneuron survival was observed in the MSC-treated group, coupled with a smaller decrease of inputs at the motoneuron surface and nearby neuropil, seen by synaptophysin and synapsin immunolabeling and decreased astrogliosis, seen by GFAP immunolabeling. In this sense, MSC-treated group displayed a significant preservation of GABAergic terminals, indicating a possible neuroprotection to glutamate excitotoxicity. Motor function recovery was acutely improved in MSC-treated group as compared to Dulbeco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM)-treated. Overall, we provide evidence that ventral root crushing (VRC), although milder than avulsion, results in significant loss of motoneurons (∼51%) that can be reduced by MSC administration within the spinal cord. Such treatment also improves the number of synapses immunoreactive against molecules present in inhibitory inputs. Also, an increased number of regenerated axons was obtained in the MSC-treated group, in comparison to the DMEM-treated control. Overall, MSC therapy acutely improved limb strength and gait coordination, indicating a possible clinical application of such treatment following proximal lesions at the CNS/PNS interface.

AB  - Abstract
Phoenixin-14 amide, herein referred to as phoenixin, is a newly identified peptide from the rat brain. Using a previously characterized rabbit polyclonal antiserum against phoenixin, enzyme-immunoassay detected a high level (&gt;4.5 ng/g tissue) of phoenixin-immunoreactivity (irPNX) in the rat spinal cords. Immunohistochemical studies revealed irPNX in networks of cell processes in the superficial dorsal horn, spinal trigeminal tract and nucleus of the solitary tract; and in a population of dorsal root, trigeminal and nodose ganglion cells. The pattern of distribution of irPNX in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn was similar to that of substance P immunoreactivity (irSP). Double-labeling the dorsal root ganglion sections showed that irPNX and irSP express in different populations of ganglion cells. In awake mice, intrathecal injection of phoenixin (1 or 5 μg) did not significantly affect the tail-flick latency as compared to that in animals injected with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). Intrathecal administration of phoenixin (0.5, 1.25 or 2.5 μg) significantly reduced the number of writhes elicited by intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid (0.6%, 0.3 ml/30 g) as compared to that in mice injected with aCSF. While not affecting the tail-flick latency, phoenixin antiserum (1:100) injected intrathecally 10 min prior to the intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid significantly increased the number of writhes as compared to mice pre-treated with normal rabbit serum. Intrathecal injection of non-amidated phoenixin (2.5 μg) did not significantly alter the number of writhes evoked by acetic acid. Our result shows that phoenixin is expressed in sensory neurons of the dorsal root, nodose and trigeminal ganglia, the amidated peptide is bioactive, and exogenously administered phoenixin may preferentially suppress visceral as opposed to thermal pain.

AB  - Abstract
Ethanol has been described as a teratogen in vertebrate development. During early stages of brain formation, ethanol affects the evagination of the optic vesicles, resulting in synophthalmia or cyclopia, phenotypes where the optic vesicles partially or totally fuse. The mechanisms by which ethanol affects the morphogenesis of the optic vesicles are however largely unknown. In this study we make use of in situ hybridization, electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry to show that ethanol has profound effects on cell organization and gene expression during the evagination of the optic vesicles. Exposure to ethanol during early eye development alters the expression patterns of some genes known to be important for eye morphogenesis, such as rx3/1 and six3a. Furthermore, exposure to ethanol interferes with the acquisition of neuroepithelial features by the eye field cells, which is clear at ultrastructual level. Indeed, ethanol disrupts the acquisition of fusiform cellular shapes within the eye field. In addition, tight junctions do not form and retinal progenitors do not properly polarize, as suggested by the mis-localization and down-regulation of zo1. We also show that the ethanol-induced cyclopic phenotype is significantly different to that observed in cyclopic mutants, suggesting a complex effect of ethanol on a variety of targets.

Our results show that ethanol not only disrupts the expression pattern of genes involved in retinal morphogenesis, such as rx3 and rx1, but also disrupts the changes in cell polarity that normally occur during eye field splitting. Thus, ethylic teratology seems to be related not only to modifications in gene expression and cell death but also to alterations in cell morphology.

AB  - Abstract
Focal malformations of cortical development (FMCD) are highly associated with several neurological disorders including intractable epilepsy and neurocognitive disabilities. Over the past decade, several FMCD subtypes have been linked to hyperactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling cascade. In view of the roles that mTOR plays in cell proliferation, size, motility, and stem cell phenotype, many of the features of FMCD such as cytomegaly, disorganized lamination, and expression of stem cell markers can be explained by enhanced mTOR signaling. FMCD result from several distinct and fascinating molecular mechanisms including biallelic gene inactivation, somatic mutation, and potentially, viral infection. These mechanisms have been directly linked to mTOR activation. Perhaps most compelling, pharmacological inhibition of mTOR has been implemented successfully in clinical trials for select FMCD and provides a new vista for treatment.

AB  - Abstract
To investigate the role of glutamate receptor subtypes and GABA in orofacial function, six individual topographies of orofacial movement, both spontaneous and induced by the dopamine D1-like receptor agonist [R/S]-3-methyl-6-chloro-7,8-dihydroxy-1-[3-methyl-phenyl]-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine (SKF 83959), were quantified in mutant mice with deletion of (a) GluN2A, B or D receptors, and (b) the GABA synthesizing enzyme, 65-kD isoform of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65). In GluN2A mutants, habituation of head movements was disrupted and vibrissae movements were reduced, with an overall increase in locomotion; responsivity to SKF 83959 was unaltered. In GluN2B mutants, vertical and horizontal jaw movements and incisor chattering were increased, with an overall decrease in locomotion; under challenge with SKF 83959, head and vibrissae movements were reduced. In GluN2D mutants, horizontal jaw movements, incisor chattering and vibrissae movements were increased, with reduced tongue protrusions and no overall change in locomotion; under challenge with SKF 83959, horizontal jaw movements were increased. In GAD65 mutants, vertical jaw movements were increased, with disruption to habituation of locomotion; under challenge with SKF 83959, vertical and horizontal jaw movements and incisor chattering were decreased. Effects on orofacial movements differed from their effects on regulation of overall locomotor behavior. These findings (a) indicate novel, differential roles for GluN2A, B and D receptors and for GAD65-mediated GABA in the regulation of individual topographies of orofacial movement and (b) reveal how these roles differ from and/or interact with the established role of D1-like receptors in pattern generators and effectors for such movements.

Here, we have translated from the rat to the non-human primate a unilateral lumbosacral injury as a model for cauda equina injury. In this morphological study, we have investigated retrograde effects of a unilateral L6–S2 ventral root avulsion (VRA) injury as well as the long-term effects of Wallerian degeneration on avulsed ventral roots at 6–10 months post-operatively in four adult male rhesus monkeys.

Immunohistochemistry for choline acetyl transferase and glial fibrillary acidic protein demonstrated a significant loss of the majority of the axotomized motoneurons in the affected L6–S2 segments and signs of an associated astrocytic glial response within the ventral horn of the L6 and S1 spinal cord segments. Quantitative analysis of the avulsed ventral roots showed that they exhibited normal size and were populated by a normal number of myelinated axons. However, the myelinated axons in the avulsed ventral roots were markedly smaller in caliber compared to the fibers of the intact contralateral ventral roots, which served as controls. Ultrastructural studies confirmed the presence of small myelinated axons and a population of unmyelinated axons within the avulsed roots. In addition, collagen fibers were readily identified within the endoneurium of the avulsed roots.

In summary, a lumbosacral VRA injury resulted in retrograde motoneuron loss and astrocytic glial activation in the ventral horn. Surprisingly, the Wallerian degeneration of motor axons in the avulsed ventral roots was followed by a repopulation of the avulsed roots by small myelinated and unmyelinated fibers. We speculate that the small axons may represent sprouting or axonal regeneration by primary afferents or autonomic fibers.

AB  - Abstract
A clear link exists between iron deficiency (ID) and nigrostriatal dopamine malfunction. This link appears to play an important role in at least restless legs syndrome (RLS) if not several other neurological diseases. Yet, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The effects of ID on gene expression in the brain have not been studied extensively. Here, to better understand how exactly ID alters dopamine functioning, we investigated the effects of ID on gene expression in the brain, seeking to identify any potential transcription-based mechanisms. We used six strains of recombinant inbred mice (BXD type) known to differ in susceptibility to ID in the brain. Upon weaning, we subjected mice from each strain to either an iron-deficient or iron-adequate diet. After 100 days of dietary treatment, we measured the effects of ID on gene expression in the ventral midbrain, a region containing the substantia nigra. The substantia nigra is the base of the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway and a region particularly affected by iron loss in RLS. We screened for ID-induced changes in expression, including changes in that of both iron-regulating and dopamine-related genes. Results revealed a number of expression changes occurring in ID, with large strain-dependent differences in the genes involved and number of expression changes occurring. In terms of dopamine-related genes, results revealed ID-induced expression changes in three genes with direct ties to nigrostriatal dopamine functioning, two of which have never before been implicated in an iron–dopamine pathway. These were stromal cell-derived factor 1 (Cxcl12, or SDF-1), a ferritin regulator and potent dopamine neuromodulator, and hemoglobin, beta adult chain 1 (Hbb-b1), a gene recently shown to play a functional role in dopaminergic neurons. The extent of up-regulation of these genes varied by strain. This work not only demonstrates a wide genetic variation in the transcriptional response to ID in the brain, but also reveals two novel biochemical pathways by which iron may potentially alter dopamine function.

AB  - Extracellular matrix (ECM) forms an active interface around neurons of the central nervous system (CNS). Whilst the components, chemical heterogeneity and cellular recruitment of this intercellular assembly in various parts of the brain have been discussed in detail, the spinal cord received limited attention in this context. This is in sharp contrast to its clinical relevance since the overall role of ECM especially that of its chondroitin sulphate-based proteoglycan components (CSPGs) was repeatedly addressed in neuropathology, regeneration, CNS repair and therapy models. Based on two post-mortem human specimen, this study gives the first and detailed description of major ECM components of the human spinal cord. Immunohistochemical investigations were restricted to the systematic mapping of aggrecan, brevican, proteoglycan link-protein as well as tenascin-R and hyaluronan containing matrices in the whole cranio-caudal dimension of the human spinal cord. Other proteoglycans like versican, neurocan and NG2 were exemplarily investigated in restricted areas. We show the overall presence of tenascin-R and hyaluronan in both white and grey matters whereas aggrecan, proteoglycan link-protein and brevican were restricted to the grey matter. In the grey matter, the ECM formed aggrecan-based perineuronal nets in the ventral and lateral horns but established single perisynaptic assemblies, axonal coats (ACs), containing link-protein and brevican in all regions except of the Lissauer’s zone. Intersegmental differences were reflected in the appearance of segment-specific nuclei but not in overall matrix distribution pattern or chemical heterogeneity. Perineuronal nets were typically associated with long-range projection neurons including cholinergic ventral horn motorneurons or dorsal spinocerebellar tract neurons of the Clarke–Stilling nuclei. Multiple immunolabelling revealed that nociceptive afferents were devoid of individual matrix assemblies unlike glycinergic or GABAergic synapses. The detailed description of ECM distribution in the human spinal cord shall support clinical approaches in injury and regenerative therapy.

AB  - Abstract
Neuroinflammation in the spinal cord plays a critical role in the processing of inflammatory pain. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a predominant omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid in the central nervous system, is known to modulate inflammatory responses in various neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we investigated whether DHA could reduce inflammatory pain and inhibit neuroinflammation in the spinal cord following carrageenan injection in mice. Intrathecal (i.t.) injection of DHA at 15 min before carrageenan injection blocked carrageenan-induced pain hypersensitivity for more than 6 h. In addition, i.t. injection of DHA at 3 h after carrageenan transiently reversed carrageenan-induced heat hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia. Furthermore, DHA treatment reduced carrageenan-induced activation of microglia, phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and production of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosisfactor-α – TNF-α and interleukin-1β – IL-1β) in the L4–5 spinal cord. In cultured microglial cells, DHA dose-dependently reduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced phosphorylation of p38, production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL3 and CXCL10). p38 inhibitor SB203580 inhibited LPS-induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these results provide evidence that DHA has antinociceptive effect in inflammatory pain, which may be attributed to, at least partially, suppressing a microglia-mediated inflammatory response through inhibition of p38 MAPK activation.

AB  - Abstract
The migration of subventricular zone (SVZ)-derived neural precursor cells through the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to the olfactory bulb is tightly regulated by local micro-environmental cues. Insulin-like Growth Factor-I (IGF-I) can stimulate the migration of several neuronal cell types and acts as a ‘departure’ factor in the avian SVZ. To establish whether IGF-I can also act as a migratory factor for adult neuronal precursor cells in vivo, in addition to its well established role in precursor cell proliferation and differentiation, we used AAV2-mediated gene transfer to produce ectopic expression of IGF-I in the normal adult rat striatum. We then assessed whether the expression of IGF-I would recruit SVZ-derived neuronal precursor cells from the RMS into the striatum. Ectopic expression of IGF-I in the normal adult rat brain significantly increased the number of doublecortin (Dcx)-positive cells and the extent of their migration into the striatum 4 and 8 weeks after AAV2–IGF-I injection but did not promote neuronal differentiation. In vitro migration assays confirmed that IGF-I is an inducer of migration and directs SVZ-derived adult neuronal precursor cell migration by both chemotaxis and chemokinesis. These results demonstrate that overexpression of IGF-I in the normal adult rat brain can override the normal cues directing precursor cell migration along the RMS and can redirect precursor cell migration into a non-neurogenic region. Enhanced expression of IGF-I following brain injury may therefore act as a diffusible factor mediating precursor cell migration to areas of neuronal cell damage.

AB  - Abstract
Zebrafish has emerged as an important vertebrate animal model for the study of human diseases and for developmental studies in mammals. Since there are few studies of the tachykinin 1 gene (TAC1), precursor of substance P (SP), in relation to embryonic development, we aimed to study the expression of SP transcript (mRNA) and determine the influence of cocaine and opioid receptors on the expression of this neuropeptide. In order to analyse the spatial and temporal SP mRNA expression in zebrafish, we cloned – based on human TAC1 sequence – the sequence that originates SP. Phylogenetic analyses of the precursor of SP, revealed an alignment in the fish cluster, with a clear distinction from other species (amphibians, birds and mammals). Real time PCR (qPCR) results showed that SP mRNA was expressed in several stages of embryonic development, where it increased progressively from gastrula-8 hpf (hour post-fertilisation) to the end of the embryogenesis-72 hpf. SP mRNA was expressed mainly in the spinal cord in embryos at 20–30 hpf, whereas at 36, 42 and 48 hpf embryos SP mRNA was expressed mainly in the CNS telencephalon, diencephalon, hypothalamus, rhombomeres, epiphysis and in peripheral areas (heart and somites). Exposure of embryos to 1.5 μM cocaine altered the SP mRNA expression at 24 (increasing) and 48 hpf (decreasing). We also report that knockdown of μ-opioid receptor induced an increase of SP mRNA expression while the knockdown of the two delta opioid receptors did not produce changes in SP mRNA expression.

In conclusion, SP mRNA in zebrafish is expressed during embryonic development in the CNS and peripherally, suggesting that SP would play a critical role during embryogenesis. Furthermore, cocaine exposure and the knockdown of μ-opioid receptor affect the SP mRNA expression. These observations can be important in the pain and addiction field where SP is involved.

AB  - Abstract
Central dopamine systems are key players in the cerebral organization of behavior and in various neurological and psychiatric diseases. We demonstrate the presence of a neurochemical feed-forward loop characterized by region-specific changes in dopamine efflux in serially connected striatal regions, providing evidence in favor of the existence of so-called spiraling striato–nigro–striatal connections. Using in vivo microdialysis of rats, we show that simultaneous stimulation of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the accumbal shell decreased dorsal striatal dopamine efflux via a direct or indirect feed-forward loop involving shell, core, ventrolateral and dorsal part of the striatum: simultaneous stimulation of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the shell decreased dopamine efflux in the core; flupenthixol-induced inhibition of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the core increased dopamine efflux in the ventrolateral part of the striatum, and simultaneous stimulation of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the ventrolateral part of the striatum decreased dopamine efflux in the dorsal part of the striatum. Finally, simultaneous stimulation of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in the shell decreased dopamine efflux in the dorsal part of the striatum. Thus, distinct striatal regions act also in series, providing a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying dopamine-dependent behaviors and the progression of dopamine-dependent disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and addiction.

AB  - Abstract
Elevated nerve growth factor (NGF) is believed to play a role in many types of pain. An NGF-blocking antibody (muMab 911) has been shown to reduce pain and hyperalgesia in pain models, suggesting a novel therapeutic approach for pain management. Since NGF also plays important roles in peripheral nervous system development and sensory nerve outgrowth, we asked whether anti-NGF antibodies would adversely impact peripheral nerve regeneration. Adult rats underwent a unilateral sciatic nerve crush to transect axons and were subcutaneously dosed weekly for 8 weeks with muMab 911 or vehicle beginning 1 day prior to injury. Plasma levels of muMab 911 were assessed from blood samples and foot print analysis was used to assess functional recovery. At 8-weeks post-nerve injury, sciatic nerves were prepared for light and electron microscopy. In a separate group, Fluro-Gold was injected subcutaneously at the ankle prior to perfusion, and counts and sizes of retrogradely labeled and unlabeled dorsal root ganglion neurons were obtained. There was no difference in the time course of gait recovery in antibody-treated and vehicle-treated animals. The number of myelinated and nonmyelinated axons was the same in the muMab 911-treated crushed nerves and intact nerves, consistent with observed complete recovery. Treatment with muMab 911 did however result in a small decrease in average cell body size on both the intact and injured sides. These results indicate that muMab 911 did not impair functional recovery or nerve regeneration after nerve injury in adult rats.

AB  - Abstract
Exposure to the pesticide paraquat (PQ) increases the risk of Parkinson’s disease (PD), and its effect may be modulated by genetic or other environmental factors. The neuropeptide PACAP (pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide, Adcyap1) has been shown to enhance tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and VMAT2 expression, protect dopaminergic (DA) neurons against the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine, regulate neuronal mitochondria, and inhibit inflammation. Decreased expression of PACAP may thus interact with environmental factors such as PQ to increase the risk of PD. To mimic a low level environmental exposure to PQ, wild type (WT) and PACAP knockout (KO) mice were given a single [10 mg/kg] dose of PQ, a regimen that did not induce the loss of TH expression or DA neurons in WT mice. This treatment selectively reduced the number of TH-positive cell bodies in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) selectively in PACAP KO mice. Because inflammation is also a risk factor for PD, we performed a quantitative analysis of SNpc Iba+ microglia. As expected, PQ increased the number of larger microglial profiles, indicative of activation, in WT mice. Strikingly, microglial activation was already evident in PACAP KO mice in the basal state. PQ caused no further activation in these mice, although tumor necrosis factor-α gene expression was enhanced. In the periphery, PQ had no effects on the abundance of proinflammatory Th1 or Th17 cells in WT mice, but increased the numbers of anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells (Tregs). PACAP KO mice, in contrast, had elevated numbers of Th17 cells after PQ, and the induction of Tregs was impaired. The results indicate that endogenous PACAP acts to maintain the integrity of DA neurons during exposure to PQ, an action that may be linked to its ability to regulate microglia and/or other immune cells.

AB  - Abstract
It was recently established that the stomach-derived ghrelin and the adipokine leptin promote learning and memory through actions within the hippocampus. Changes in the peripheral or brain levels of these peptides were described in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients and were shown to correlate with the severity of cognitive decline. Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that leptin or ghrelin can ameliorate amyloid and tau pathologies as well as cognitive deficits. However, the exact role of these peptides in AD is far from being elucidated. To fill this gap, our working hypothesis was that leptin and ghrelin can exert a neuroprotective role in AD suppressing hippocampal dysfunction triggered by synapto- and neurotoxic amyloid-β oligomers (AβO). Using primary cultured hippocampal neurons, we demonstrated that both peptides reduce AβO-induced production of superoxide and mitochondrial membrane depolarization, improving cell survival, and inhibit cell death through a receptor-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, it was shown that in AβO-treated neurons both leptin and ghrelin prevent glycogen synthase kinase 3β activation. Therefore, the evidence gathered in this study revealed that leptin and ghrelin can act as neuroprotective agents able to rescue hippocampal neurons from AβO toxicity, thus highlighting their potential therapeutic role in AD.

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protects hippocampal neurons from glutamate excitotoxicity as determined by analysis of chromatin condensation, through activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) signaling pathways. However, it is still unknown whether BDNF also prevents the degeneration of axons and dendrites, and the functional demise of synapses, which would be required to preserve neuronal activity. Herein, we have studied the time-dependent changes in several neurobiological markers, and the regulation of proteolytic mechanisms in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, through quantitative western blot and immunocytochemistry. Calpain activation peaked immediately after the neurodegenerative input, followed by a transient increase in ubiquitin-conjugated proteins and increased abundance of cleaved-caspase-3. Proteasome and calpain inhibition did not reproduce the protective effect of BDNF and caspase inhibition in preventing chromatin condensation. However, proteasome and calpain inhibition did protect the neuronal markers for dendrites (MAP-2), axons (Neurofilament-H) and the vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT1-2), whereas caspase inhibition was unable to mimic the protective effect of BDNF on neurites and synaptic markers. BDNF partially prevented the downregulation of synaptic activity measured by the KCl-evoked glutamate release using a Förster (Fluorescence) resonance energy transfer (FRET) glutamate nanosensor. These results translate a time-dependent activation of proteases and spatial segregation of these mechanisms, where calpain activation is followed by proteasome deregulation, from neuronal processes to the soma, and finally by caspase activation in the cell body. Moreover, PI3-K and PLCγ small molecule inhibitors significantly blocked the protective action of BDNF, suggesting an activity-dependent mechanism of neuroprotection. Ultimately, we hypothesize that neuronal repair after a degenerative insult is initiated at the synaptic level.

AB  - We investigated adjustments of control to initial posture in squat jumping. Eleven male subjects jumped from three initial postures: preferred initial posture (PP), a posture in which the trunk was rotated 18° more backward (BP) and a posture in which it was rotated 15° more forward (FP) than in PP. Kinematics, ground reaction forces and electromyograms (EMG) were collected. EMG was rectified and smoothed to obtain smoothed rectified EMG (srEMG). Subjects showed adjustments in srEMG histories, most conspicuously a shift in srEMG-onset of rectus femoris (REC): from early in BP to late in FP. Jumps from the subjects’ initial postures were simulated with a musculoskeletal model comprising four segments and six Hill-type muscles, which had muscle stimulation (STIM) over time as input. STIM of each muscle changed from initial to maximal at STIM-onset, and STIM-onsets were optimized using jump height as criterion. Optimal simulated jumps from BP, PP and FP were similar to jumps of the subjects. Optimal solutions primarily differed in STIM-onset of REC: from early in BP to late in FP. Because the subjects’ adjustments in srEMG-onsets were similar to adjustments of the model’s optimal STIM-onsets, it was concluded that the former were near-optimal. With the model we also showed that near-maximum jumps from BP, PP and FP could be achieved when STIM-onset of REC depended on initial hip joint angle and STIM-onsets of the other muscles were posture-independent. A control theory that relies on a mapping from initial posture to STIM-onsets seems a parsimonious alternative to theories relying on internal optimal control models.

AB  - Physical exercise is known to produce beneficial effects to the nervous system. In most cases, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in such effects. However, little is known on the role of BDNF in exercise-related effects on Parkinson’s disease (PD). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of intermittent treadmill exercise-induced behavioral and histological/neurochemical changes in a rat model of unilateral PD induced by striatal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), and the role of BDNF in the exercise effects. Adult male Wistar rats were divided into two main groups: (1) injection of K252a (a blocker of BDNF receptors), and (2) without BDNF receptor blockade. These groups were then subdivided into four groups: control (CLT), sedentary (SED, non-exercised with induction of PD), exercised 3×/week during four weeks before and four weeks after the induction of PD (EXB + EXA), and exercised 3×/week during four weeks after the induction of PD (EXA).

One month after 6-OHDA injections, the animals were subjected to rotational behavioral test induced by apomorphine and the brains were collected for immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting assays, in which we measured BDNF and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the striatum (caudate-putamen, CPu).

Our results showed a significant reduction of rotational asymmetry induced by apomorphine in the exercised parkinsonian rats. BDNF decreased in the SNc of the SED group, and exercise was able to revert that effect. Exercised groups exhibited reduced damage to the dopaminergic system, detected as a decreased drop of TH levels in SNc and CPu. On the other hand, BDNF blockade was capable of substantially reducing TH expression postlesion, implying enhanced dopaminergic cell loss.

Our data revealed that physical exercise is capable of reducing the damage induced by 6-OHDA, and that BDNF receptors are involved in that effect.

AB  - The inferior colliculus (IC) integrates ascending auditory input from the lower brainstem and descending input from the auditory cortex. Understanding how IC cells integrate these inputs requires identification of their synaptic arrangements. We describe excitatory synapses in the dorsal cortex, central nucleus, and lateral cortex of the IC (ICd, ICc and IClc) in guinea pigs. We used electron microscopy (EM) and post-embedding anti-GABA immunogold histochemistry on aldehyde-fixed tissue from pigmented adult guinea pigs. Excitatory synapses were identified by round vesicles, asymmetric synaptic junctions, and gamma-aminobutyric acid-immunonegative (GABA-negative) presynaptic boutons.

Excitatory synapses constitute ∼60% of the synapses in each IC subdivision. Three types can be distinguished by presynaptic profile area and number of mitochondrial profiles. Large excitatory (LE) boutons are more than 2 μm2 in area and usually contain five or more mitochondrial profiles. Small excitatory (SE) boutons are usually less than 0.7 μm2 in area and usually contain 0 or 1 mitochondria. Medium excitatory (ME) boutons are intermediate in size and usually contain 2 to 4 mitochondria. LE boutons are mostly confined to the ICc, while the other two types are present throughout the IC. Dendritic spines are the most common target of excitatory boutons in the IC dorsal cortex, whereas dendritic shafts are the most common target in other IC subdivisions. Finally, each bouton type terminates on both gamma-aminobutyric acid-immunopositive (GABA+) and GABA-negative (i.e., glutamatergic) targets, with terminations on GABA-negative profiles being much more frequent.

The ultrastructural differences between the three types of boutons presumably reflect different origins and may indicate differences in postsynaptic effect. Despite such differences in origins, each of the bouton types contact both GABAergic and non-GABAergic IC cells, and could be expected to activate both excitatory and inhibitory IC circuits.

AB  - General anesthesia is occasionally associated with postoperative complications such as sleep disorder, drowsiness, or mood alterations. Hippocampal acetylcholine (ACh), the extracellular level of which increases during the dark (active) phase and decreases during the light (rest) phase in rats, is thought to be associated with locomotor activity and be crucial for learning and memory. Propofol, an intravenous anesthetic, is known to shift the circadian rhythms of physiological parameters including locomotor activity and body temperature in both rodents and humans, while the effects of volatile anesthetics on the circadian rhythm largely remain unclear. The present study examined the effects of isoflurane anesthesia on the diurnal changes in hippocampal ACh release and locomotor activity in rats. Rats were divided into three groups: a light-phase anesthesia group (LA group), a dark-phase anesthesia group (DA group), and a control group. They were exposed to a 12-h light/12-h dark environment and anesthetized with 1.4% isoflurane for 4 h during the middle of the light phase (LA group) and dark phase (DA group). Simultaneous measurement of hippocampal ACh by microdialysis and locomotor activity were done for 60 h under free-moving conditions. Hippocampal ACh release and locomotor activity showed a clear circadian rhythm. In the DA group, but not in the LA group, the diurnal variation in ACh release was significantly disturbed and a more than 2-h phase-advance in locomotor activity was observed. There was a significant correlation between hippocampal ACh release and locomotor activity, and isoflurane anesthesia disrupted it even after anesthesia was discontinued. This study revealed that the levels and circadian rhythms of hippocampal ACh release and locomotor activity were more sensitive to isoflurane anesthesia when it was administered during the active phase. Our findings suggest that anesthesia exerts differential effects on the regulation of circadian rhythms depending on the circadian phase.

AB  - AbstractIntroduction
The startle reflex is an involuntary reaction to sudden sensory input and consists of a generalized flexion response. Startle responses in distal leg muscles occur more frequently during standing compared to sitting. We hypothesized that sensory input from load receptors modulates the occurrence of startle responses in leg muscles.
Methods
We administered sudden startling auditory stimuli (SAS) to 11 healthy subjects while (1) sitting relaxed, (2) standing relaxed, (3) standing while bearing 60% of their weight on the right leg, (4) standing while bearing 60% of their weight on the left leg, and (5) standing with 30% body weight support (‘bilateral unloaded’). The requested weight distribution for each condition was verified using force plates. Electromyography data were collected from both tibialis anterior (TA) and the left sternocleidomastoid muscles.
Results
In the TA, startle responses occurred much more frequently during normal standing (26% of trials) compared to both sitting (6% of trials, p &lt; 0.01) and bilateral unloading (3% of trials, p &lt; 0.01). In the asymmetrical stance conditions, startle responses in the TA were more common in the loaded leg (21% of trials) compared to the unloaded leg (10% of trials, p &lt; 0.05).
Discussion
The occurrence of startle responses in the leg muscles was strongly influenced by load. Hence, it is likely that information from load receptors influences startle response activity. We suggest that, in a stationary position, startling stimuli result in a descending volley from brainstem circuits, which is gated at the spinal level by afferent input from load receptors.

AB  - Abstract
Recent studies have shown genetic deletion of the gene that synthesizes 5-HT in enteric neurons (tryptophan hydroxylase-2, Tph-2) leads to a reduction in intestinal transit. However, deletion of the Tph-2 gene also leads to major developmental changes in enteric ganglia, which could also explain changes in intestinal transit. We sought to investigate this further by acutely depleting serotonin from enteric neurons over a 24-h period, without the confounding influences induced by genetic manipulation. Guinea-pigs were injected with reserpine 24 h prior to euthanasia. Video-imaging and spatio-temporal mapping was used to record peristalsis evoked by natural fecal pellets, or slow infusion of intraluminal fluid. Immunohistochemical staining for 5-HT was used to detect the presence of serotonin in the myenteric plexus. It was found that endogenous 5-HT was always detected in myenteric ganglia of control animals, but never in guinea-pigs treated with reserpine. Interestingly, peristalsis was still reliably evoked by either intraluminal fluid, or fecal pellets in reserpine-treated animals that also had their entire mucosa and submucosal plexus removed. In these 5-HT depleted animals, there was no change in the frequency of peristalsis or force generated during peristalsis. In control animals, or reserpine treated animals, high concentrations (up to 10 μM) of ondansetron and SDZ-205-557, or granisetron and SDZ-205-557 had no effect on peristalsis. In summary, acute depletion of serotonin from enteric nerves does not prevent distension-evoked peristalsis, nor propulsion of luminal content. Also, we found no evidence that 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptor activation is required for peristalsis, or propulsion of contents to occur. Taken together, we suggest that the intrinsic mechanisms that generate peristalsis and entrain propagation along the isolated guinea-pig distal colon are independent of 5-HT in enteric neurons or the mucosa, and do not require the activation of 5-HT3 or 5-HT4 receptors.

AB  - Abstract
The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has emerged as a key structure involved in the modulation of fear behavior over the past few decades. Anatomical, functional and electrophysiological studies have begun to shed light on the precise mechanisms by which different prefrontal regions regulate the expression and inhibition of fear behavior. These studies have established a canonical view of mPFC functions during fear behavior with dorsal regions selectively involved in the expression of fear behavior and ventral regions linked to the inhibition of fear behavior. Although numerous reports support this view, recent data have refined this model and suggested that dorsal prefrontal regions might also play an important role in the encoding of fear behavior itself. The recent development of sophisticated approaches such as large scale neuronal recordings, simultaneous multisite recordings of spiking activity and local field potentials (LFPs) along with optogenetic approaches will facilitate the testing of these new hypotheses in the near future. Here we provide an extensive review of the literature on the role of mPFC in fear behavior and propose further directions to dissect the contribution of specific prefrontal neuronal elements and circuits in the regulation of fear behavior.

AB  - Abstract
Recent results suggest significant cross-correlation between the spike trains of the suprageniculate nucleus (SG) of the posterior thalamus and the caudate nucleus (CN) during visual stimulation. In the present study visually evoked local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded simultaneously in the CN and the SG in order to investigate the coupling between these structures at a population level. The effect of static and dynamic visual stimulation was analyzed in 55 SG–CN LFP pairs in the frequency range 5–57 Hz. Statistical analysis revealed significant correlation of the relative powers of each investigated frequency band (5–8 Hz, 8–12 Hz, 12–35 Hz and 35–57 Hz) during both static and dynamic visual stimulation. The temporal evolution of cross-correlation showed that in the majority of the cases the SG was activated first, and in approximately one third of the cases, the CN was activated earlier. These observations suggest a bidirectional information flow. The most interesting finding of this study is that different frequency bands exhibited significant cross-correlation in a stimulation paradigm-dependent manner. That is, static stimulation usually increased the cross-correlation of the higher frequency components (12–57 Hz) of the LFP, while dynamic stimulation induced changes in the lowest frequency band (5–8 Hz). This suggests a parallel processing of dynamic and static visual information in the SG and the CN. To our knowledge we are the first to provide evidence on the co-oscillation and synchronization of the CN and the SG at a population level upon visual stimulation, which suggests a significant cooperation between these structures in visual information processing.

AB  - Abstract
Elevated smoking rates seen in schizophrenia populations may be an attempt to correct neuropathologies associated with deficient nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and/or dopaminergic systems using exogenous nicotine. However, nicotine’s effects on cognitive processing and sensory gating have been shown to be baseline-dependent. Evidence of a restorative effect on sensory gating deficits by nicotine-like agonists has been demonstrated, however, its underlying mechanisms in the context of dopamine dysregulation are unclear. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), a key dopamine regulator in the brain, contains a co-dominant allele in which a valine-to-methionine substitution causes variations in enzymatic activity leading to reduced synaptic dopamine levels in the Val/Val genotype. Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design with 57 non-smokers, this study examined the effects of COMT genotype on sensory gating and its modulation by nicotine in low vs. high suppressors. The results were consistent with the hypothesis that increased dopamine resulting from nicotine stimulation or Met allelic activity would benefit gating in low suppressors and impair gating in high suppressors, and that this gating improvement with nicotine would be more evident in Val carriers who were low suppressors, while the gating impairment would be more evident in Met carriers who were high suppressors. These findings reaffirm the importance of baseline-dependency and suggest a subtle relationship between COMT genotype and baseline-stratified levels of sensory gating, which may help to explain the variability of cognitive abilities in schizophrenia populations.

AB  - Abstract
Valproic acid (VPA) is a blocker of histone deacetylase widely used to treat epilepsy, bipolar disorders, and migraine; its administration during pregnancy increases the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the child. Thus, prenatal VPA exposure has emerged as a rodent model of ASD. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effect of prenatal administration of VPA (500 mg/kg) at E12.5 on the exploratory behavior and locomotor activity in a novel environment, as well as on neuronal morphological rearrangement in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), in the hippocampus, in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) at three different ages: immediately after weaning (postnatal day 21 [PD21]), prepubertal (PD35) and postpubertal (PD70) ages. Hyper-locomotion was observed in a novel environment in VPA animals at PD21 and PD70. Interestingly, exploratory behavior assessed by the hole board test at PD70 showed a reduced frequency but an increase in the duration of head-dippings in VPA-animals compared to vehicle-treated animals. In addition, the latency to the first head-dip was longer in prenatal VPA-treated animals at PD70. Quantitative morphological analysis of dendritic spine density revealed a reduced number of spines at PD70 in the PFC, dorsal hippocampus and BLA, with an increase in the dendritic spine density in NAcc and ventral hippocampus, in prenatal VPA-treated rats. In addition, at PD70 increases in neuronal arborization were observed in the NAcc, layer 3 of the PFC, and BLA, with retracted neuronal arborization in the ventral and dorsal hippocampus. Our results extend the list of altered behaviors (exploratory behavior) detected in this model of ASD, and indicate that the VPA behavioral phenotype is accompanied by previously undescribed morphological rearrangement in limbic regions.

AB  - AbstractObject
The aim of this study is to explore the changes of inter-hemispheric functional connectivity in patients with unilateral brachial plexus injury.
Methods
Nine patients with five roots of unilateral brachial plexus avulsion injury and 11 healthy controls were recruited in this study. Resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance image was used to study the differences of inter-hemispheric functional connectivity between patients and healthy controls. Four areas were defined as regions of interest (ROI): the two primary motor areas (M1 areas) and two supplementary motor areas (SMAs) in the two hemispheres activated when the healthy controls performed unilateral hand grasping movement of the two hands, respectively. Functional connectivity maps were generated by correlating the regional time course of each ROI with that of every voxel in the whole brain. Then, functional connectivity was calculated by correlating the functional magnetic resonance image signal time courses of every two ROIs.
Results
Resting-state inter-hemispheric functional connectivity of the primary motor areas was reduced following brachial plexus avulsion injury. The correlation coefficients of the SMAs showed no difference between the brachial plexus patients and healthy volunteers.
Conclusions
Our results indicate that brachial plexus injury decreases resting-state inter-hemispheric functional connectivity of the two primary motor areas. These results provide new insight into functional reorganization of the cerebral cortex after brachial plexus injury.

AB  - Abstract
Prolyl oligopeptidase (EC 3.4.21.26, PREP) is a serine protease that hydrolyzes proline-containing peptides shorter than 30-mer but it has also nonhydrolytic functions. PREP has been shown to accelerate aggregation of wild-type α-synuclein (α-syn) under cell-free conditions, and PREP inhibitors can block this aggregation both in vitro and in vivo. α-syn is the main component of Lewy bodies in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Lewy body dementia. To clarify the possible interaction of PREP with other markers of neurodegenerative diseases, we studied colocalizations of PREP and (1) α-syn, (2) β-amyloid, (3) tau protein and (4) astroglial and microglial cells in human post-mortem brain samples from PD, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients and in healthy control brain samples. In the substantia nigra of PD brains, an intense colocalization with PREP and α-syn was evident. PREP colocalized also with β-amyloid plaques in AD brains and with tau protein in AD and in healthy brains. PREP was also found in astroglial cells in PD, AD and control brains, but not in the microglia. Our findings are the first ones to demonstrate colocalization of PREP and pathological proteins in the human brain and support the view that, at least in spatial terms, PREP could be associated with pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Abstract
Neurotrophic factors may play a role in exercise-induced neuroprotective effects, however it is not known if exercise mediates changes in glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) protein levels in the spinal cord. The aim of the current study was to determine if 2 weeks of exercise alters GDNF protein content in the lumbar spinal cord of young and old rats. GDNF protein was quantified via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. Immunohistochemical analysis localized GDNF in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive motor neurons and cell body areas were measured. Involuntary running in the young animals appeared to elicit the greatest increase in GDNF protein content (sixfold increase), followed by swimming (threefold increase) and voluntary running (twofold increase); however there was no significant difference between the modalities of exercise. Low-intensity running of the old animals significantly increased GDNF protein content in the spinal cord. Both young and old exercised animals showed a doubling in ChAT-positive motor neuron cell body areas. These results suggest that GDNF protein content in the spinal cord is modulated by exercise.

AB  - Cholinergically differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were treated with a pathophysiologically relevant, low (300 nM), and a high (3 μM) dose of amyloid beta 1-42 (Abeta) or 42-1 (revAbeta). At early (1 and 4 h) and late (24 h) time points, the pro- and anti-apoptotic factors – caspase-3 and p53, and B-cell lymphoma 2 protein (Bcl-2), respectively – were assessed together with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release as measure of cell viability and ATP levels as marker of mitochondrial activity. The low peptide dose significantly increased Bcl-2 and, time-delayed, caspase-3 and ATP levels, but barely impacted on LDH release, while the high concentration remarkably depressed Bcl-2 levels, depleted ATP and led to increased LDH release. We also monitored acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzymatic activity and splice variant levels (tailed and readthrough AChE; AChE-T and AChE-R), and assessed choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and high-affinity choline uptake (HACU). The low Abeta concentration drastically upregulated AChE-R and increased both ChAT and HACU, while the high dose caused cholinergic toxicity. We believe this study offers the first insight into the highly concentration-dependent effects of Abeta on cholinergic dynamics. In particular, it highlights the rescuing role of AChE-R as being, together with mitochondrial activity, involved in cholinergic adaptation to low doses of Abeta.

AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced white matter injury in the neonatal rat brain is associated with inflammatory processes. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) can be induced by inflammatory stimuli, such as cytokines and pro-inflammatory molecules, suggesting that COX-2 may be considered as the target for anti-inflammation. The objective of the present study was to examine whether celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, can reduce systemic LPS-induced brain inflammation and brain damage. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of LPS (2 mg/kg) was performed in postnatal day 5 (P5) of Sprague–Dawley rat pups and celecoxib (20 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered i.p. 5 min after LPS injection. The body weight and wire-hanging maneuver test was performed 24 h after the LPS exposure, and brain injury was examined after these tests. Systemic LPS exposure resulted in an impairment of behavioral performance and acute brain injury, as indicated by apoptotic death of oligodendrocytes (OLs) and loss of OL immunoreactivity in the neonatal rat brain. Treatments with celecoxib significantly reduced systemic LPS-induced neurobehavioral disturbance and brain damage. Celecoxib administration significantly attenuated systemic LPS-induced increments in the number of activated microglia and astrocytes, concentrations of IL-1β and TNFα, and protein levels of phosphorylated-p38 MAPK in the neonatal rat brain. The protection of celecoxib was also associated with a reduction of systemic LPS-induced COX-2+ cells which were double labeled with GFAP+ (astrocyte) cells. The overall results suggest that celecoxib was capable of attenuating the brain injury and neurobehavioral disturbance induced by systemic LPS exposure, and the protective effects are associated with its anti-inflammatory properties.

AB  - The analgesic effectiveness of long-term opioid therapies is compromised by the development of antinociceptive tolerance linked to the overt production of peroxynitrite (ONOO−, PN), the product of the interaction between superoxide (O2−, SO) and nitric oxide (NO), and to neuroinflammatory processes. We have recently reported that in addition to post-translational nitration and inactivation of mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase holoenzyme (NOX) in the spinal cord is a major source for the overt production of superoxide-derived PN during the development of morphine-induced antinociceptive tolerance. However, the NOX complex involved in these processes is not known. The objective of these studies is to identify a potential role for the NOX2 complex, an enzyme involved in inflammation. Mice lacking the catalytic subunit of NOX2 (Nox2−/−) or its regulatory subunit, p47phox (p47phox−/−), developed antinociceptive tolerance similar to wildtype (wt) mice after 3 days of continuous morphine. However, while wt mice continue to develop tolerance by day six, morphine analgesia was restored in both Nox2−/− and p47phox−/− mice. Moreover, the loss of Nox2 or p47 did not affect acute morphine analgesia in naïve mice. In wt mice, antinociceptive tolerance was associated with increased activation of NOX, nitration of MnSOD, and proinflammatory cytokines production in the spinal cord. These events were markedly attenuated in Nox2−/− and p47phox−/− mice and instead, there was enhanced formation of antiinflammatory cytokine (IL4 and IL10) production. These results suggest that NOX2 activity provides a significant source of superoxide-derived PN to undertake post-translational modifications of mitochondrial MnSOD and to engage neuroinflammatory signaling in the spinal cord associated with opioid-induced antinociceptive tolerance. Thus, NOX2 may provide a potential target for adjuvant therapy to protect opioid analgesia.

AB  - Abstract
Glycine acts as a neuromodulator to regions rich in glutamatergic synapses, such as the forebrain. However, recent evidences for synaptic release of glycine in hippocampal cultured neurons and synaptosomes argue for the existence of functional glycinergic synapses in the hippocampus. It is well established that GABA and glycine act in concert at inhibitory synapses, while the existence of synapses which utilize both glutamate and glycine is less common. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the distribution of glycine and its role in hippocampal neurotransmission. Using immunohistochemistry, we demonstrate that vesicular glycine is preferentially stored in glutamatergic, rather than GABAergic presynaptic terminals. Using the sniffer patch technique, we found that glycine could be released upon presynaptic activity. Furthermore, using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we show for the first time the presence of a postsynaptic strychnine-sensitive chloride current in response to presynaptic stimulation. The small amplitude of this current is likely due to the paucity of postsynaptic glycine receptors rather than a low level of glycine release. Taken together, our results suggest that glycine is stored in glutamatergic presynaptic terminals. It is likely that the major role of glycine that is released from presynaptic terminals is to modulate N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor function but may also play a role in decreasing neuronal excitability by opposing glutamatergic neurotransmission in pathological states such as epilepsy or ischemia.

AB  - Abstract
Stress affects brain activity and promotes long-term changes in multiple neural systems. Exposure to stressors causes substantial effects on the perception and response to pain. In several animal models, chronic stress produces lasting hyperalgesia. Postmortem studies of patients with stress-related psychiatric disorders have demonstrated a decrease in the number of astrocytes and the level of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for astrocyte, in the cerebral cortex. Since astrocytes play vital roles in maintaining neuroplasticity via synapse maintenance and secretion of neurotrophins, damage of astrocytes is thought to be involved in the neuropathology. In the present study we examined GFAP, S100β and CD11b protein levels in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) after the subacute and chronic restraint stresses to clarify changes in descending pain modulatory system in the rat with stress-induced hyperalgesia. Chronic restraint stress (6 h/day for 3 weeks), but not subacute restraint stress (6 h/day for 3 days), caused a marked mechanical hypersensitivity. Subacute and chronic restraint stresses induced a significant decrease of GFAP protein level in the RVM (21.9 ± 3.6%, p &lt; 0.01 and 18.2 ± 5.1%, p &lt; 0.05 vs. control group, respectively). In the chronic stress group, the GFAP protein level in the RVM was positively correlated with the mechanical threshold (p &lt; 0.05). The immunohistochemical analysis revealed that chronic restraint stress induced a significant decrease in GFAP-immunoreactivity in the nucleus raphe magnus, a part of the RVM, compared to subacute restraint stress. In contrast there was no significant difference in the S100β and CD11b protein levels between the control and stress groups. These findings suggest that the long-lasting decrease of GFAP protein induced by chronic restraint stress causes dysfunction of astrocytes, which may be involved in the impairment of the RVM that plays pivotal roles in pain modulation.

AB  - Abstract
Autism and Asperger’s disorder (AD) are neurodevelopmental disorders primarily characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication, however motor coordination deficits are increasingly recognized as a prevalent feature of these conditions. Although it has been proposed that children with autism and AD may have difficulty utilizing visual feedback during motor learning tasks, this has not been directly examined. Significantly, changes within the cerebellum, which is implicated in motor learning, are known to be more pronounced in autism compared to AD. We used the classic double-step saccade adaptation paradigm, known to depend on cerebellar integrity, to investigate differences in motor learning and the use of visual feedback in children aged 9–14 years with high-functioning autism (HFA; IQ &gt; 80; n = 10) and AD (n = 13). Performance was compared to age and IQ matched typically developing children (n = 12). Both HFA and AD groups successfully adapted the gain of their saccades in response to perceived visual error, however the time course for adaptation was prolonged in the HFA group. While a shift in saccade dynamics typically occurs during adaptation, we revealed aberrant changes in both HFA and AD groups. This study contributes to a growing body of evidence centrally implicating the cerebellum in ocular motor dysfunction in autism. Specifically, these findings collectively imply functional impairment of the cerebellar network and its inflow and outflow tracts that underpin saccade adaptation, with greater disturbance in HFA compared to AD.

AB  - Abstract
Nicotine and methamphetamine (METH) cause addiction by triggering neuroplastic changes in brain reward pathways though they each engage distinct molecular targets (nicotine receptors and dopamine transporters respectively). Addiction to both drugs is very prevalent, with the vast majority of METH users also being smokers of cigarettes. This co-morbid occurrence thus raised questions about potential synergistic rewarding effects of the drugs. However, few studies have investigated the chronic neurobiological changes associated with co-morbid nicotine and METH addiction. Here we investigated the effects of these two drugs alone and in combination on the expression of several immediate early genes (IEGs) that are sensitive to drug exposures. Chronic exposure to either nicotine or METH caused significant decreases in the expression of fosb, fra1, and fra2 in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) but not in the dorsal striatum whereas the drug combination increased fra2 expression in both structures. Except for junB mRNA levels that were decreased by the three drug treatments in the NAc, there were no significant changes in the Jun family members. Of the Egr family members, NAc egr2 expression was decreased after nicotine and the drug combination whereas NAc egr3 was decreased after METH and the drug combination. The drug combination also increased striatal egr3 expression. The Nr4a family member, nr4a2/nurr1, showed increased striatal expression after all three drug treatments, while striatal nr4a3/nor-1 expression was increased by the drug combination whereas NAc nr4a1/nurr77 was decreased by nicotine and the drug combination. These observations suggest that, when given in combination, the two drugs exert distinct effects on the expression of IEGs in dopaminergic projection areas from those elicited by each drug alone. The significance of these changes in IEG expression and in other molecular markers in fostering co-morbid METH and nicotine abuse needs to be further evaluated.

AB  - Abstract
The hypothalamic release of glutamate and GABA regulates neurosecretory functions that may control the onset of puberty. This release may be influenced by neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone. Using superfusion experiments we examined the role of allopregnanolone on the K+-evoked and basal [3H]-glutamate and [3H]-GABA release from mediobasal hypothalamus and anterior preoptic area in prepubertal, vaginal opening and pubertal (P) rats and evaluated its modulatory effect on GABAA and NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartic acid) receptors. Also, we examined the hypothalamic activity and mRNA expression of 3α-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase (3α-HSOR) – enzyme that synthesizes allopregnanolone – using a spectrophotometric method and RT-PCR, respectively. Allopregnanolone increased both the K+-evoked [3H]-glutamate and [3H]-GABA release in P rats, being the former effect mediated by the modulation of NMDA receptors – as was reverted by Mg2+ and by the NMDA receptor antagonist AP-7 and the latter by the modulation of NMDA and GABAA receptors – as was reverted by Mg2+ and the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline. The neurosteroid also increased the basal release of [3H]-glutamate in VO rats in an effect that was dependent on the modulation of NMDA receptors as was reverted by Mg2+. On the other hand we show that allopregnanolone reduced the basal release of [3H]-GABA in P rats although we cannot elucidate the precise mechanism by which the neurosteroid exerted this latter effect. The enzymatic activity and the mRNA expression of 3α-HSOR were both increased in P rats regarding the other two studied stages of sexual development. These results suggest an important physiological function of allopregnanolone in the hypothalamus of the P rat where it might be involved in the ‘fine tuning’ of neurosecretory functions related to the biology of reproduction of the female rats.

AB  - Ideomotor theory holds that the perception or anticipatory imagination of action effects activates motor tendencies toward the action that is known to produce these effects, herein referred to as ideomotor response activation (IRA). IRA presupposes that the agent has previously learned which action produces which effects, and that this learning process has created bidirectional associations between the sensory effect codes and the motor codes producing the sensory effects. Here, we refer to this process as ideomotor learning. In the presented fMRI study, we adopted a standard two-phase ideomotor learning paradigm; a mixed between/within-subjects design allowed us to assess the neural substrate of both, IRA and ideomotor learning. We replicated earlier findings of a hand asymmetry in ideomotor processing with significantly stronger IRA by left-hand than right-hand action effects. Crucially, we traced this effect back to more pronounced associative learning for action-contingent effects of the left hand compared with effects of the right hand. In this context, our findings point to the caudate nucleus and the angular gyrus as central structures of the neural network underlying ideomotor learning.

AB  - We investigated the effect of two well characterized preclinical animal models of depression – repeated injections of corticosterone (CORT) and repeated restraint stress – on markers of GABAergic and glutamatergic activity in the hippocampus and amygdala. Stress is an identified risk factor for the onset of major depression, but the neurobiological mechanisms by which stress may produce depressogenic effects are not clear. Rats received one of the following four treatments for 21 consecutive days: daily single CORT injections (40 mg/kg), daily single vehicle injections, daily 6 h of restraint stress, or daily handling. After the 21-day stress period, all rats were sacrificed and hippocampal and amygdalar tissue was collected and prepared for Western blot analyses. We examined the effect of CORT and restraint stress on glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)-65 and GAD67, as well as the α1, α2, α3, and β2–3 GABAA receptor subunits, and the vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT)-2. We found that CORT significantly decreased GAD65 and the α2 receptor subunit and increased VGLUT2 within the hippocampus. We also found that CORT decreased GAD67 and the α2 receptor subunit in the amygdala. However, restraint stress had no significant effect on protein expression in either the hippocampus or the amygdala. These findings parallel our previous results showing that repeated CORT injections, but not restraint stress, increase depression-like behavior in rats, and suggest that the depressogenic effects of CORT may be related to alterations in GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in stress-sensitive regions of the brain.

AB  - Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides information regarding white matter microstructure; however, macroscopic fiber architectures can affect DTI measures. A larger brain (fiber tract) has a ‘relatively’ smaller voxel size, and the voxels are less likely to contain more than one fiber orientation and more likely to have higher fractional anisotropy (FA). Previous DTI studies report left-to-right differences in the white matter; however, these may reflect true microscopic differences or be caused purely by volume differences. Using tract-based spatial statistics, we investigated left-to-right differences in white matter microstructure across the whole brain. Voxel-wise analysis revealed a large number of white matter volume asymmetries, including leftward asymmetry of the arcuate fasciculus and cingulum. In many white matter regions, FA asymmetry was positively correlated with volume asymmetry. Voxel-wise analysis with adjustment for volume asymmetry revealed many white matter FA asymmetries, including leftward asymmetry of the arcuate fasciculus and cingulum. The voxel-wise analysis showed a reduced number of regions with significant FA asymmetry compared with analysis performed without adjustment for volume asymmetry; however, the overall trend of the results was unchanged. The results of the present study suggest that these FA asymmetries are not caused by volume differences and reflect microscopic differences in the white matter.

AB  - Neurological deficit following cerebral infarction correlates with not only primary injury, but also secondary neuronal apoptosis in remote loci connected to the infarction. Netrin-1 is crucial for axonal guidance by interacting with its receptors, deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) and uncoordinated gene 5H (UNC5H). DCC and UNC5H are also dependence receptors inducing cell apoptosis when unbound by netrin-1. The present study is to investigate the role of netrin-1 and its receptors in ipsilateral ventroposterior thalamic nucleus (VPN) injury secondary to stroke in hypertensive rats. Renovascular hypertensive Sprague–Dawley rats underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Continuous intracerebroventricular infusion of netrin-1 (600 ng/d for 7 days) or vehicle (IgG/Fc) was given 24 h after MCAO. Neurological function was evaluated by postural reflex 8 and 14 days after MCAO. Then, immunoreactivity was determined in the ipsilateral VPN for NeuN, glial fibrillary acidic protein, netrin-1 and its receptors (DCC and UNC5H2), apoptosis was detected with Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated digoxigenin-dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, and the expressions of caspase-3, netrin-1, DCC, and UNC5H2 were quantified by western blot analysis. MCAO resulted in the impaired postural reflex after 8 and 14 days, with decreased NeuN marked neurons and increased TUNEL-positive cells, as well as an up-regulation in the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and UNC5H2 protein in the ipsilateral VPN, without significant change in DCC or netrin-1 expression. By exogenous netrin-1 infusion, the number of neurons was increased in the ipsilateral VPN, and both TUNEL-positive cell number and caspase-3 protein level were reduced, while UNC5H2 expression remained unaffected, simultaneously, the impairment of postural reflex was improved. Taken together, the present study indicates that exogenous netrin-1 could rescue neuron loss by attenuating secondary apoptosis in the ipsilateral VPN after focal cerebral infarction, possibly via its receptor UNC5H2, suggesting that relative insufficiency of endogenous netrin-1 be an underlying mechanism of secondary injury in the VPN post stroke.

AB  - Previous studies revealed mechanisms of dendritic inputs leading to action potential initiation at the axon initial segment and backpropagation into the dendritic tree. This interest has recently expanded toward the communication between different parts of the dendritic tree which could preprocess information before reaching the soma. This study tested for effects of asymmetric voltage attenuation between different sites in the dendritic tree on summation of synaptic inputs and action potential initiation using the NEURON simulation environment. Passive responses due to the electrical equivalent circuit of the three-dimensional neuron architecture with leak channels were examined first, followed by the responses after adding voltage-gated channels and finally synaptic noise. Asymmetric attenuation of voltage, which is a function of asymmetric input resistance, was seen between all pairs of dendritic sites but the transfer voltages (voltage recorded at the opposite site from stimulation among a pair of dendritic sites) were equal and also summed linearly with local voltage responses during simultaneous stimulation of both sites. In neurons with voltage-gated channels, we reproduced the observations where a brief stimulus to the proximal ascending dendritic branch of a pyramidal cell triggers a local action potential but a long stimulus triggers a somal action potential. Combined stimulation of a pair of sites in this proximal dendrite did not alter this pattern. The attraction of the action potential onset toward the soma with a long stimulus in the absence of noise was due to the higher density of voltage-gated sodium channels at the axon initial segment. This attraction was, however, negligible at the most remote distal dendritic sites and was replaced by an effect due to high input resistance. Action potential onset occurred at the dendritic site of higher input resistance among a pair of remote dendritic sites, irrespective of which of these two sites received the synaptic input. Exploration of the parameter space showed how the gradient of voltage-gated channel densities and input resistances along a dendrite could draw the action potential onset away from the stimulation site. The attraction of action potential onset toward the higher density of voltage-gated channels in the soma during stimulation of the proximal dendrite was, however, reduced after the addition of synaptic noise.

AB  - The onset of action of antidepressants (ADs) usually takes several weeks, but first molecular responses to these drugs may appear already after acute administration. The Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase/Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (ERK/MAPK) signaling pathway is a target of ADs and an important pathway involved in cellular plasticity. In major depressive disorder (MDD), especially the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (Hip) are most likely affected in depressive patients and recent work revealed a hyperactivated ERK signaling in the rat PFC after chronic stress, a precipitating factor for MDD.

Strong evidences support that not only neurons but also astrocytes participate in neuronal activity and may therefore additionally be a substrate of AD action.

In this study, we show by Western blot that neither fluoxetine (FLX) nor desipramine (DMI) preferentially affects the activation of one of the two ERK isoforms, ERK1 and ERK2, with respect to the other. Further immunohistochemical analysis in the PFC revealed that basal levels of phospho-activated ERK (pERK) are mostly found in neurons in contrast to very few astrocytes. Both ADs can inhibit neuronal pERK as early as 15 min after drug administration with peculiar regional and layer specificities. Contrarily, at this time point none of the two ADs shows a clear modulation of astrocytic pERK. We propose that this mechanism of action of ADs may be protective against an exacerbated cortical ERK activity that may exert detrimental effects on susceptible neuronal populations. Our findings on acute effects of AD treatment in the adult mouse PFC encourage to examine further how this treatment might influence pERK in animal models of depression to identify early targets of AD action.

AB  - Previously we showed that 1-(4′-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylene-dioxy-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI-52466), an ionotropic AMPA receptor antagonist, can trigger strong, presumably metabotropic, protection against seizures and stroke at very low doses. To date, no study has determined brain and plasma concentrations of GYKI-52466 following subcutaneous administration in animals with or without brain damage. Here we developed and validated a rapid method of high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection. Chromatographic separation was achieved by a Luna C18 column using a mixture of 25 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0)–methanol–acetonitrile (40:37.5:22.5, v/v/v) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. The method showed acceptable precision and accuracy and allowed a precise quantification of 25 ng/mL GYKI-52466 in the plasma and brain. Recovery of GYKI-52466 from the plasma and brain was &gt;87%, and GYKI was stable at room temperature and during prolonged storage at −20 °C. The method was successfully applied in measuring levels of GYKI-52466 following administration of 3 and 20 mg/kg of GYKI-52466 in control and brain damaged rats. A low brain concentration of 0.56 μM GYKI-52466 was observed with 3 mg/kg compared to 10.7 μM with 20 mg/kg at 90 min post drug administration. Severe ataxia was observed with the 20 mg/kg dose for up to 90 min. Furthermore, in ischaemic animals, there was no evidence of a ‘surge’ in brain GYKI concentrations at the injury site, confirming the integrity of the blood–brain barrier in the region of infarct. Taken together, our findings support a metabotropic mode of action underlying the low-dose neuroprotective efficacy of GYKI-52466.

AB  - Depression is a common outcome for those having experienced early-life stress (ELS). For those individuals, depression typically increases during adolescence and appears to endure into adulthood, suggesting alterations in the development of brain systems involved in depression. Developmentally, the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), a limbic structure associated with reward learning and motivation, typically undergoes dramatic functional change during adolescence; therefore, age-related changes in NAcc function may underlie increases in depression in adolescence following ELS. The current study examined the effects of ELS in 38 previously institutionalized children and adolescents in comparison to a group of 31 youths without a history of ELS. Consistent with previous research, the findings showed that depression was higher in adolescents than children with a history of ELS. Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging results showed atypical NAcc development, where the ELS group did not show a typical increase in NAcc reactivity during adolescence. Consequently, the ELS group showed NAcc hypoactivation during adolescence, and lower NAcc reactivity was correlated with higher depression scores. The results have important implications for understanding how ELS may influence increases in depression via neural development during the transition to adolescence and highlight the importance of identifying at-risk individuals in childhood, a potential critical period for depression-targeted intervention.

AB  - This study investigated the involvement of the adenosinergic system in antiallodynia induced by exercise in an animal model of complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS-I). Furthermore, we analyzed the role of the opioid receptors on exercise-induced analgesia. Ischemia/reperfusion (IR) mice, nonexercised and exercised, received intraperitoneal injections of caffeine (10 mg/kg, a non selective adenosine receptor antagonist), 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX) (0.1 mg/kg, a selective adenosine A1 receptor antagonist), ZM241385 (3 mg/kg, a selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist), adenosine deaminase inhibitor erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3nonyl) adenine [(EHNA), 5 mg/kg, an adenosine deaminase inhibitor] or naloxone (1 mg/kg, a nonselective opioid receptor antagonist). The results showed that high-intensity swimming exercise reduced mechanical allodynia in an animal model of CRPS-I in mice. The antiallodynic effect caused by exercise was reversed by pretreatment with caffeine, naloxone, DPCPX but it was not modified by ZM241385 treatment. In addition, treatment with EHNA, which suppresses the breakdown of adenosine to inosine, enhanced the pain-relieving effects of the high-intensity swimming exercise. This is the first report demonstrating that repeated sessions of high-intensity swimming exercise attenuate mechanical allodynia in an animal model of CRPS-I and that the mechanism involves endogenous adenosine and adenosine A1 receptors. This study supports the use of high-intensity exercise as an adjunct therapy for CRPS-I treatment.

AB  - Throughout life, new neurons arise from the ventricular zone of the adult songbird brain and are recruited to the song control nucleus higher vocal center (HVC), from which they extend projections to its target, nucleus robustus of the arcopallium (RA). This process of ongoing parenchymal neuronal addition and circuit integration is both triggered and modulated by seasonal surges in systemic testosterone. Brain aromatase converts circulating testosterone to estradiol, so that HVC is concurrently exposed to both androgenic and estrogenic stimulation. These two signals cooperate to trigger HVC endothelial cell division and angiogenesis, by inducing the regionally-restricted expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), its matrix-releasing protease MMP9, and its endothelial receptor VEGFR2. The expanded HVC microvascular network then secretes the neurotrophic factor BDNF, which in turn supports the recruitment of newly generated neurons. This process is striking for its spatial restriction and hence functional specificity. While androgen receptors are broadly expressed by the nuclei of the vocal control system, estrogen receptor (ERα) expression is largely restricted to HVC and its adjacent mediocaudal neopallium. The geographic overlap of these receptor phenotypes in HVC provides the basis for a regionally-defined set of paracrine interactions between the vascular bed and neuronal progenitor pool that both characterize and distinguish this nucleus. These interactions culminate in the focal attraction of new neurons to the adult HVC, the integration of those neurons into the extant vocal control circuits, and ultimately the acquisition and elaboration of song.

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin (NT) known to participate in chronic somatic pain. A recent study has indicated that BDNF may participate in chronic cystitis at the peripheral level. However, the principal site of action for this NT is the central nervous system, most notably the spinal cord. The effects of centrally-acting BDNF on bladder function in normal animals and its central role during chronic cystitis are presently unknown. The present study was undertaken to clarify this issue. For that purpose, control non-inflamed animals were intrathecally injected with BDNF, after which bladder function was evaluated. This treatment caused short-lasting bladder hyperactivity; whereas chronic intrathecal administration of BDNF did not elicit this effect. Cutaneous sensitivity was assessed by mechanical allodynia as an internal control of BDNF action.

To ascertain the role of BDNF in bladder inflammation, animals with cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis received intrathecal injections of either a general Trk receptor antagonist or a BDNF scavenger. Blockade of Trk receptors or BDNF sequestration notably improved bladder function. In addition, these treatments also reduced referred pain, typically observed in rats with chronic cystitis. Reduction of referred pain was accompanied by a decrease in the spinal levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, a marker of increased sensory barrage in the lumbosacral spinal cord, and spinal BDNF expression.

Results obtained here indicate that BDNF, acting at the spinal cord level, contributes to bladder hyperactivity and referred pain, important hallmarks of chronic cystitis. In addition, these data also support the development of BDNF modulators as putative therapeutic options for the treatment of chronic bladder inflammation.

AB  - The roles of the central noradrenergic and serotonergic system in the activity-dependent regulation of ocular dominance plasticity have been a contentious issue. Using c-Fos activity mapping, we have developed a new, straightforward method to measure the strength of ocular dominance plasticity: the number of c-Fos-immunopositive cells in layer IV of rat visual cortex (Oc1B), ipsilateral to the stimulated eye, is a sensitive and reliable measure of the effects of monocular deprivation. Applying this new method, here we studied the unique modification of the degree of c-Fos expression induced in the visual cortex, in that endogenous noradrenaline (NA) and serotonin (5HT) in the cortex were significantly reduced, respectively by specific pharmacological agents. Intraperitoneal injections of N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP4) and p-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA) selectively impair NA- and 5HT-containing nerve terminals and fibers, respectively. In the visual cortex with strongly reduced NA, the number of c-Fos-immunopositive cells was found remaining significantly decreased in response to stimulation of the deprived eye, while by open eye stimulation the expected increase in c-Fos-immunoreactivity was strongly suppressed, showing values not different from those obtained by monocular stimulation in the normal rats. In contrast, in the visual cortex with strongly reduced 5HT no expected decrease was found in response to stimulation of the deprived eye, while, as is usually the case for the normal animals, a significant increase was still induced in response to open eye stimulation. These findings suggest that the noradrenergic and serotonergic system regulate ocular dominance (OD) plasticity differently: in the NA-depleted cortex the expected increase in c-Fos expression by open eye stimulation was not seen due to strong suppression, whereas in 5HT-depletion, the expected decrease in c-Fos expression was not materialized due to strong suppression. The present findings with c-Fos activity mapping method indicated a novel possibility of the differential regulation of OD plasticity by two types of common monoaminergic systems.

AB  - Increasing evidence has shown that adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) could transdifferentiate into Schwann cell (SC)-like cells to enhance nerve regeneration, suggesting potential new cell-based transplantation therapy for peripheral nerve injuries and neurodegenerative disorders. For the implementation of these results to the clinical setting, it is of great importance to establish the differentiation of human ASCs (hASCs) into a SC phenotype. In this study, we studied hASCs obtained from subcutaneous fat tissue of healthy donors. By a mixture of glial growth factors we differentiated them into Schwann cell-like cells (dhASCs). We then assessed their ability to act as Schwann cells in vitro and in vivo and also compared them with primary human Schwann cells (hSCs). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that dhASCs secreted brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/nerve growth factor (NGF) at a comparable level, and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) at a level even higher than hSCs, whereas undifferentiated hASCs (uhASCs) secreted low levels of these neurotrophic factors. In co-culture with NG108-15 neuronal cells we found that both dhASCs and hSCs significantly increased the percentage of cells with neurites, the neurite length, and the number of neurites per neuron, whereas uhASCs increased only the percentage of cells with neurites. Finally, we transplanted green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled hASCs into the crushed tibial nerve of athymic nude rats. The transplanted hASCs showed a close association with PGP9.5-positive axons and myelin basic protein (MBP)-positive myelin at 8 weeks after transplantation. Quantitative analysis revealed that dhASCs transplantation resulted in significantly improved survival and myelin formation rates (a 7-fold and a 10-fold increase, respectively) as compared with uhASCs transplantation. These findings suggest that hASCs took part in supporting and myelinating regenerating axons, and thus have achieved full glial differentiation in vivo. In conclusion, hASCs can differentiate into SC-like cells that possess a potent capacity to secrete neurotrophic factors as well as to form myelin in vivo. These findings make hASCs an interesting prospect for cell-based transplantation therapy for various peripheral nerve disorders.

AB  - There is general consensus in the literature that a distributed network of temporal and frontal brain areas is involved in speech comprehension. However, how active versus passive tasks modulate the activation and the functional connectivity of the critical brain areas is not clearly understood. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify intelligibility and task-related effects in speech comprehension. Participants performed a semantic judgment task on normal and time-reversed sentences, or passively listened to the sentences without making an overt response. The subtraction analysis demonstrated that passive sentence comprehension mainly engaged brain areas in the left anterior and posterior superior temporal sulcus and middle temporal gyrus (aSTS/MTG and pSTS/MTG), whereas active sentence comprehension recruited bilateral frontal regions in addition to the aSTS/MTG and pSTS/MTG regions. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that during passive sentence comprehension, the left aSTS/MTG was functionally connected with the left Heschl’s gyrus (HG) and bilateral superior temporal gyrus (STG) but no area was functionally connected with the left pSTS/MTG; during active sentence comprehension, however, both the left aSTS/MTG and pSTS/MTG were functionally connected with bilateral superior temporal and inferior frontal areas. While these results are consistent with the view that the ventral stream of the temporo-frontal network subserves semantic processing, our findings further indicate that both the activation and the functional connectivity of the temporal and frontal areas are modulated by task demands.

AB  - Exposure to alcohol during adolescence exerts long-term effects on the adult brain stress circuits, causing many changes that persist into adulthood. Here we examined the consequences of adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE, administered from postnatal day (PND) 28–42) on the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis-related brain circuitry of rats challenged with intragastric (ig) administration of alcohol in adulthood (PND 70–71). Both male and female adolescent rats were exposed to alcohol vapors, while controls did not receive the drug, to assess whether AIE alters adult alcohol response in a sex-specific manner. We demonstrated that AIE increased paraventricular nucleus (PVN) Avp mRNA levels during late (PND 42) but not middle (PND 36) adolescence in males. While an alcohol challenge administered to 70–71-day-old rats increased Crf mRNA levels in males and Avp mRNA levels in females, AIE blunted both effects. These results suggest that AIE produced long-lasting changes in the responsiveness of the HPA axis to a subsequent alcohol challenge in a sex-specific manner. Furthermore, AIE altered adrenergic brain stem nuclei involved in stress responses in adulthood, resulting in increased numbers of phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) neurons in male C2 and female C1 regions. This tended to enhance activation of the male C2 nucleus upon alcohol challenge. Collectively, these results suggest that AIE exerts long-term effects on the ability of the PVN to respond to an alcohol challenge in adulthood, possibly mediated by catecholaminergic input from the brain stem to the PVN.

AB  - Background
Integration of information between multiple cortical regions is thought to underpin the experience of pain. Yet studies tend to focus on pain related changes in discrete cortical regions. Although altered processing in the primary motor (M1) and sensory cortex (S1) is implicated in pain, the temporal relationship between these regions is unknown and may provide insight into the interaction between them.
Methods
We used recordings of somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) and transcranial magnetic stimulation to investigate the temporal relationship between altered excitability of the primary sensory cortex and corticomotor output during and after muscle pain induced by hypertonic saline infusion into the right first dorsal interosseous. SEPs and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded in 12 healthy individuals.
Results
Participants reported an average pain intensity of 5.4 (0.5) on a 10-cm visual analogue scale. The area of the N20–P25–N33 complex of the SEP was reduced during and after pain, but MEP amplitudes were suppressed only after pain had resolved.
Conclusions
Our data show that pain reduces sensory processing before motor output is altered. This temporal dispersion, coupled with the lack of correlation between pain-induced changes in S1 and M1 excitability, imply either that independent processes are involved, or that reduced excitability of S1 during acute experimental muscle pain mediates latent reductions in motor output via processes that are non-linear and potentially involve activation of a wider brain network.

AB  - Oligodendrocytes are important for not only nerve conduction but also central nervous system (CNS) development and neuronal survival in a variety of conditions. Kallikrein-related peptidase 6 (KLK6) is expressed in oligodendrocytes in the CNS and its expression is changed in several physiological and pathological conditions, especially following spinal cord injury (SCI) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. In this study, we investigated the functions of KLK6 in oligodendrocyte lineage cell development and the production of myelin proteins using KLK6-deficient (KLK6−/−) mice. KLK6−/− mice were born without apparent defects and lived as long as wild-type (WT) mice. There was no significant difference in the numbers of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and mature oligodendrocytes in the adult naive spinal cord between WT and KLK6−/− mice. However, there were fewer mature oligodendrocytes in the KLK6−/− spinal cord than in the WT spinal cord at postnatal day 7 (P7). Expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) and oligodendrocyte-specific protein/claudin-11, major myelin proteins, was also decreased in the KLK6−/− spinal cord compared with the WT spinal cord at P7–21. Moreover, after SCI, the amount of MBP in the damaged spinal cords of KLK6−/− mice was significantly less than that in the damaged spinal cords of WT mice. These results indicate that KLK6 plays a functional role in oligodendrocyte development and the expression of myelin proteins.

AB  - We demonstrated previously that the lysophosphatidic acid-1 (LPA1) receptor plays a crucial role in the initiation of peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain through the alternation of pain-related genes/proteins expression and demyelination. The present study revealed that mild cerebral ischemia by left transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) for 15 min causes the hypersensitive responses (paw withdrawal) to the nociception by electrical stimuli to the paw by the use of Neurometer Current Perception Threshold/C (CPT/C). The hypersensitivity or neuropathic pain was only observed by the stimulation with 250 and 2000, but not 5 Hz, which are the characterized sine-wave frequencies of Aδ-, Aβ- or C-fibers, respectively. The significant neuropathic pain was observed from day 2 through week 2 on the right paw after tMCAO, while there was slight but significant pain sensitivity on the left paw at day 7. The neuropathic pain on the contralateral side at week 2 after tMCAO was completely abolished in LPA1−/− mice. These results suggest that LPA1 receptor signaling plays key roles in the development of central neuropathic pain following cerebral ischemia as well as the peripheral neuropathic pain following partial sciatic nerve injury.

AB  - Long-term potentiation (LTP) can be induced by electrical stimulation and gives rise to an increase in synaptic strength at the first relay. This phenomenon has been associated with learning and memory and also could be the origin of several pathological states elicited by an initial strong painful stimulus, such as some forms of neuropathic pain. We used high-frequency electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve in anesthetized rats to produce spinal LTP. To evaluate the effect of spinal LTP on the activity of neurons in the posterior triangular nucleus of the thalamus (PoT), we applied an electrical stimulation (40 stimuli; 1 ms; 0.5 Hz; 1.5 mA) to cutaneous tissues at 10-min intervals during at least 3 h. In the majority of cases, PoT cells did not respond to cutaneous stimulation before LTP, but 50 min after LTP induction PoT cells progressively began responding to the cutaneous stimulation. Furthermore, after 3 h of LTP induction, PoT neurons could respond to cutaneous stimulation applied to different paws. Interestingly, the conduction velocities for the receptive field responses from the paw to the PoT cells were compatible with those of Aδ-fibers. Since PoT cells project to the insular cortex, the progressive increase in PoT activity and also the progressive unmasking of somatic receptive fields in response to LTP, place these cells in a key position to detect pain stimuli following central sensitization.

AB  - Cholinergic system is important for respiratory control from the first days of life. Disturbances in cholinergic pathway due to early life stress like hypoxic shock can adversely affect the ventilatory response. The present study evaluates neonatal hypoxic insult mediated cholinergic disturbances and the role of glucose, oxygen and epinephrine resuscitation. The changes in total muscarinic, muscarinic M1, M2, M3 receptors and the enzymes involved in acetylcholine metabolism – cholineacetyl transferase and acetylcholine easterase in the cerebellum were analyzed. Hypoxic stress decreased cerebellar muscarinic receptor density with a decreased muscarinic M1, M2 and M3 receptor gene expression. The metabolic shift in the acetylcholine synthesis and release is indicated by the decreased cholineacetyl transferase mRNA expression and increased acetylcholine esterase gene expression. Glucose, acting as a precursor for acetyl choline synthesis and an immediate energy source, helps in reversing the cholinergic disturbances in hypoxic neonates. The limitation of immediate oxygenation and epinephrine administration in ameliorating cholinergic disturbances in hypoxic neonates was also reported. This will help in devising a better resuscitation program for the management of neonatal hypoxia.

AB  - Working memory (WM) training has been shown to lead to improvements in WM capacity and fluid intelligence. Given that divergent thinking loads on WM and fluid intelligence, we tested the hypothesis that WM training would improve performance and moderate neural function in the Alternate Uses Task (AUT)—a classic test of divergent thinking. We tested this hypothesis by administering the AUT in the functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner following a short regimen of WM training (experimental condition), or engagement in a choice reaction time task not expected to engage WM (active control condition). Participants in the experimental group exhibited significant improvement in performance in the WM task as a function of training, as well as a significant gain in fluid intelligence. Although the two groups did not differ in their performance on the AUT, activation was significantly lower in the experimental group in ventrolateral prefrontal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices—two brain regions known to play dissociable and critical roles in divergent thinking. Furthermore, gain in fluid intelligence mediated the effect of training on brain activation in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. These results indicate that a short regimen of WM training is associated with lower prefrontal activation—a marker of neural efficiency—in divergent thinking.

AB  - An object that suddenly appears in the visual field should be quickly detected and responded to because it could be beneficial or harmful. The superficial layer of the superior colliculus (sSC) is a brain structure capable of such functions, as sSC neurons exhibit sharp transient spike discharges with short latency in response to the appearance of a visual stimulus. However, how transient activity is generated in the sSC is poorly understood. Here, we show that inhibitory inputs actively shape transient activity in the sSC. Juxtacellular recordings from anesthetized mice demonstrate that almost all types of sSC neurons, which were identified by post hoc histochemistry, show transient spike discharges, i.e., ON activity, immediately after visual stimulus onset. ON activity was followed by a pause before the visual stimulus was turned off. To determine whether the pause reflected the absence of excitatory drive or inhibitory conductance, we injected depolarizing currents juxtasomally, which enabled us to observe inhibition as decreased discharges. The pause was observed even under this condition, suggesting that inhibitory input caused the pause. We further found that local application of a mixture of GABAA and GABAB receptor antagonists additively diminished the pause. These results indicate that GABAergic inputs produce transient ON responses by attenuating excitatory activity through the cooperative activation of GABAA and GABAB receptors, allowing sSC neurons to act as a saliency detector.

AB  - G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) signal not only through heterotrimeric G proteins, but also through alternate pathways. Thus, dopamine D2 receptors in the striatum signal through Gαi/o and also by promoting formation of a multi-protein complex containing β-arrestin2, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and Akt in order to dephosphorylate Akt. Lithium, on the other hand, disrupts this complex to increase Akt phosphorylation. Rhes is a striatally enriched GTP-binding protein that has been shown to inhibit dopamine receptor-mediated behavior and signaling through heterotrimeric G proteins. Therefore, our objective was to test whether Rhes similarly affects signaling through the Akt/GSK3 pathway in the striatum. Rhes−/− mice showed basally increased Akt and GSK3β phosphorylation relative to rhes+/+ mice that was not further enhanced by lithium treatment. Furthermore, they responded to the D1/D2 agonist apomorphine with increased Akt and GSK3 phosphorylation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that apomorphine treatment recruits PP 2A-C to Akt in both rhes+/+ and rhes−/− mice. Lithium did not disrupt their interaction in rhes−/− mice as there was little basal interaction. Rhes co-immunoprecipitated with β-arrestins, suggesting that it is integral to the multi-protein complex. Thus, Rhes is necessary for Akt dephosphorylation by the striatal multi-protein complex, and in its absence, a lithium-treated phenotype results.

AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurological disorder with an increasing incidence in the aging population. Neuroprotective and/or neuroregenerative strategies remain critical in the treatment of this increasingly prevalent disease. Prosaposin is a neurotrophic factor whose neurotrophic activity is attributed to a stretch of 12 amino acids located at the N-terminal region of saposin C. The present study was performed to investigate the protective effect and mechanism of action of a prosaposin-derived 18-mer peptide (PS18: LSELIINNATEELLIKGL) in Parkinson’s disease models. We used 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) or 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+)-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in C57BL/6J mice or SH-SY5Y cells and explored the protective effect and mechanisms of action of PS18 on dopaminergic neurons. Treatment with 2.0 mg/kg PS18 significantly improved behavioral deficits, enhanced the survival of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons, and decreased the activity of astrocytes in the substantia nigra and striatum in MPTP-induced PD model mice. In vitro, a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and Hoechst 33258 staining revealed that co-treatment with 300 ng/mL PS18 and 5 mM MPP+ protected against MPP+-induced nuclear morphological changes and attenuated cell death induced by MPP+. We also found that PS18-FAM entered the cells, and the retention time of PS18-FAM in the cytoplasm of MPP+-treated cells was shorter than that of untreated cells. In addition, PS18 showed protection from MPP+/MPTP-induced apoptosis in the SH-SY5Y cells and dopaminergic neurons in the PD model mice via suppression of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/c-Jun pathway; upregulation of Bcl-2; downregulation of BAX, attenuating mitochondrial damage; and inhibition of caspase-3. These findings suggest that PS18 may provide a valuable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of progressive neurodegenerative diseases such as PD.

AB  - The GABAA receptor is the main inhibitory receptor in the brain and its subunits originate from different genes or gene families (α1–α6, β1–β3, γ1–γ3, δ, ε, θ, π, or ρ1–3). In the mouse brain the anatomical distribution of GABAA receptor subunit mRNAs so far investigated is restricted to subunits forming benzodiazepine-sensitive receptor complexes (α1–α3, α5, β2, β3 and γ2) in the forebrain and midbrain as assessed by in situ hybridization (ISH). In the present study the anatomical distribution of the GABAA receptor subunits α1–α6, β1–β3, γ1–γ2 and δ was analyzed in the mouse brain (excluding brain stem) by ISH and immunohistochemistry (IHC). In several brain areas such as hippocampus, cerebellum, bulbus olfactorius and habenula we observed that mRNA levels did not reflect protein levels, indicating that the protein is located far distantly from the cell body. We also compared the distribution of these 12 subunit mRNAs and proteins with that reported in the rat brain. Although in general there is a considerable correspondence in the distribution between mouse and rat brains, several species-specific differences were observed.

AB  - In the spinal cord serotonin (5-HT) systems modulate the spinal network via various 5-HT receptors. Serotonin 2A receptor and serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT2A and 2C receptors) are likely the most important 5-HT receptors for enhancing the motoneuron excitability by facilitating the persistent inward current (PIC), and thus play an important role for the pathogenesis of spasticity after spinal cord injury. In conjunction with our 5-HT2A receptor study, using a same sacral spinal transection rat model we have in this study examined 5-HT2C receptor immunoreactivity (5-HT2CR-IR) changes at seven different time intervals after spinal injury. We found that 5-HT2CR-IR was widely distributed in different regions of the spinal gray matter and was predominantly located in the neuronal somata and their dendrites although it seemed also present in axonal fibers in the superficial dorsal horn. 5-HT2CR-IR in different regions of the spinal gray matter was seen to be increased at 14 days after transection (with an average ∼1.3-fold higher than in sham-operated group) but did not reach a significant level until at 21 days (∼1.4-fold). The increase sustained thereafter and a plateau level was reached at 45 days (∼1.7-fold higher), a value similar as that at 60 days. When 5-HT2CR-IR analysis was confined to the ventral horn motoneuron somata (including a proportion of proximal dendrites) a significant increase was not detected until 45 days post-operation. 5-HT2CR upregulation in the spinal gray matter is confirmed with Western blot in the rats 60 days post-operation. The time course of 5-HT2CR upregulation in the spinal gray matter and motoneurons was positively correlated with the development of tail spasticity (clinical scores). This indicates that 5-HT2CR is probably an important factor underlying this pathophysiological development by increasing the excitability of both motoneurons and interneurons.

AB  - The majority of research and therapeutic actions in Parkinson’s disease (PD) focus on the encephalic areas, however, the potential involvement of the spinal cord in its genesis has received little attention. Here we examined spinal locomotor circuitry activation in patients with PD using various types of central and peripheral tonic stimulation and compared results to those of age-matched controls. Subjects lay on their sides with both legs suspended, allowing low-friction horizontal rotation of the limb joints. Air-stepping can be used as a unique and important model for investigating human rhythmogenesis since its manifestation is largely facilitated by the absence of external resistance. In contrast to the frequent occurrence of non-voluntary stepping responses in healthy subjects, both peripheral (muscle vibration) and central (Jendrassik maneuver, mental task, Kohnstamm phenomenon) tonic influences had little if any effect on rhythmic leg responses in PD. On the other hand, a remarkable feature of voluntary air-stepping movements in patients was a significantly higher frequency of leg oscillations than in age-matched controls. A lack of non-voluntary stepping responses was also observed after dopaminergic treatment despite the presence of prominent shortening reactions (SRs) to passive movements. We argue that the state and the rhythmogenesis capacity of the spinal circuitry are impaired in patients with PD. In particular, the results suggest impaired central pattern generator (CPG) access by sensory and central activations.

AB  - l-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-Dopa)-induced dyskinesia (LID) in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a major clinical problem. The prevailing view is that in PD patients and animal PD models dyskinesia develops after repeated l-dopa use or priming, independent of l-dopa’s anti-PD therapeutic effect that occurs immediately. Here we show that in mice with severe and consistent dopamine (DA) loss in the dorsal striatum, rendered by transcription factor Pitx3 null mutation, the very first injection of l-dopa or D1-like agonist SKF81297 induced both normal ambulatory and dyskinetic movements. Furthermore, the robust stimulating effects on normal and dyskinetic movements had an identical time course and parallel dose–response curves. In contrast, D2-like agonist ropinirole stimulated normal and dyskinetic movements relatively modestly. These results demonstrate that severe DA loss in the dorsal striatum sets the stage for dyskinesia to occur on the first exposure to l-dopa or a D1 agonist without any priming. These results also indicate that l-dopa stimulated both normal and dyskinetic movements primarily via D1 receptor activation and that proper D1 agonism is potentially an efficacious therapy for PD motor deficits.

AB  - Our group previously demonstrated that short-term treatment with a standardized extract of Ginkgo biloba (EGb) changed fear-conditioned memory by modulating gene expression in the hippocampus, amygdaloid complex and prefrontal cortex. Although there are few controlled studies that support the long-term use of EGb for the prevention and/or treatment of memory impairment, the chronic use of Ginkgo is common. This study evaluated the effects of chronic treatment with EGb on the conditioned emotional response, assessed by the suppression of ongoing behavior and in the modulation of gene and protein expression. Male adult Wistar rats were treated over 28 days and assigned to five groups (n = 10) as follows: positive control (4 mg kg−1 Diazepam), negative control (12% Tween 80), EGb groups (0.5 and 1.0 g kg−1) and the naïve group. The suppression of the licking response was calculated for each rat in six trials. Our results provide further evidence for the efficacy of EGb on memory. For the first time, we show that long-term treatment with the highest dose of EGb improves the fear memory and suggests that increased cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) mRNA and protein (P &lt; 0.001) in the dorsal hippocampus and amygdaloid complex and reduced growth and plasticity-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) (P &lt; 0.01) in the hippocampus are involved in this process. The fear memory/treatment-dependent changes observed in our study suggest that EGb might be effective for memory enhancement through its effect on the dorsal hippocampus and amygdaloid complex.

AB  - Abstract
Vestibulospinal reflexes elicited by head displacement in space depend on the direction of body displacement, because the neuronal responses to labyrinthine stimulation are tuned by neck displacement: a directional tuning takes place in the medial cerebellum and in spinal motoneurons, while a gain and a basal activity tuning can be observed in the reticular formation, a target structure of the medial cerebellum. In the present study, we investigated whether also the response of vestibular nuclear neurons (another target of the medial cerebellum) to labyrinthine stimulation is tuned by neck displacement and which parameters of the response are modulated by it. In urethane-anaesthetized Wistar rats, single-unit activity was recorded from the vestibular nuclei at rest and during wobble of the whole animal at 0.156 Hz. This stimulus tilted the animal’s head by a constant amplitude (5°), in a direction rotating at a constant velocity over the horizontal plane, either in clockwise or counter clockwise direction. The gain and the direction of neuronal responses to wobble were evaluated through Fourier analysis, in the control position (with coincident head and body axes) and following a body-to-head rotation of 5–30° over the horizontal plane, in both directions. Most of the vestibular neurons modified their response gain and/or their basal activity following body-to-head rotation, as it occurs in the reticular formation. Only few neurons modified their response direction, as occurs in the cerebellum and in spinal motoneurons. The different behaviour of cerebellar neurons and of their vestibular and reticular target cells, suggests that the role played by the cerebellum in the neck tuning of vestibulospinal reflexes has to be reconsidered.

AB  - Abstract
Perinatal undernutrition affects the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for learning and memory. However, far less is known about the changes of dendritic spine density and morphology related to hippocampal synaptic plasticity. As dendritic spines are dynamic structures essential for synaptic plasticity and serve as the primary post-synaptic location of the excitatory neurotransmission that underlies learning and memory, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether the perinatal undernutrition affected hippocampal synaptic plasticity accompanied by the change of dendritic spines in anesthetized rats. An input–output curve was first determined using the measurements of field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) slope in response to a series of stimulation intensities. Long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by high-frequency stimulation was recorded in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 pathway. Post-tetanic potentiation derived from the fEPSP slope was also measured immediately after LTP induction. Quantitative data of dendritic spines from hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells were obtained using Golgi staining. The results showed that 50% perinatal food restriction (FR50) impaired the magnitude of LTP of the fEPSP slope in the Schaffer collateral-CA1 pathway. Additionally, FR50 reduced overall spine densities in both basal dendrites and apical dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. Moreover, FR50 reduced type densities of thin and mushroom spines in apical dendrites, whereas a reduction in the type of mushroom spines was only observed in the basal dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. These findings suggested that perinatal undernutrition decreased excitatory synaptic input and further affected the processing of information in a given network by selectively reducing the number of special dendritic spines. Thus, these changes in the density and the types of dendritic spines in CA1 pyramidal neurons may partly explain the impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity as well as learning and memory disturbances commonly observed during undernourished rats.

AB  - Abstract
Glucocorticoid hormones exert crucial effects on the brain in relation to physiology, endocrine regulation, mood and cognition. Their two receptor types, glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors (GR and MR), are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily and act in large measure as transcription factors. The outcome of MR/GR action on the genome depends on interaction with members from different protein families, which are of crucial importance for cross-talk with other neuronal and hormonal signals that impinge on the glucocorticoid sensitive circuitry. Relevant interacting proteins include other transcription factors that may either tether the receptor to the DNA, or that bind in the vicinity of GR and MR to tune the transcriptional response. In addition, transcriptional coregulator proteins constitute the actual signal transduction pathway to the transcription machinery. We review the current evidence for involvement of individual coregulators in GR-dependent effects on stress responses, and learning and memory. We discuss the use of in vitro and in silico tools to predict those coregulators that are of importance for particular brain processes. Finally, we discuss the potential of selective receptor modulators that may only allow a subset of all interactions, thus allowing more selective targeting of glucocorticoid-dependent processes in the brain.

AB  - Abstract
A state of low dopaminergic activity has been implicated in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The clinical symptoms of ADHD include inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity, as well as impaired learning; dopaminergic modulation of the functions in the hippocampus is important to both learning and memory. To determine dopamine receptor (DR) density in a well-established animal model for ADHD, we quantified the dopamine D5 receptors in the hippocampus in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. We used immunofluorescence microscopy and immunogold electron microscopy to quantify the dopamine D5 receptor density on CA1 pyramidal cell somas and dendrites and dendritic spines in the stratum radiatum and stratum oriens. The density of the dopamine D5 receptors was significantly lower in the cytoplasm of pyramidal cell somas in the spontaneously hypertensive rat compared to the control, indicating a reduced reservoir for insertion of receptors into the plasma membrane. DRs are important for long-term potentiation and long-term depression, hence the deficit may contribute to the learning difficulties in individuals with the diagnosis of ADHD.

Processing of visual information in the brain seems to proceed from initial fast but coarse to subsequent detailed processing. Such coarse-to-fine changes appear also in the response of single neurons in the visual pathway. In the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), there is a dynamic change in the receptive field (RF) properties of neurons during visual stimulation. During a stimulus flash centered on the RF, the width of the RF-center, presumably related to spatial resolution, changes rapidly from large to small in an initial transient response component. In a subsequent sustained component, the RF-center width is rather stable apart from an initial slight widening. Several brainstem nuclei modulate the geniculocortical transmission in a state-dependent manner. Thus, modulatory input from cholinergic neurons in the peribrachial brainstem region (PBR) enhances the geniculocortical transmission during arousal. We studied whether such input also influences the dynamic RF-changes during visual stimulation. We compared dynamic changes of RF-center width of dLGN neurons during brief stimulus presentation in a control condition, with changes during combined presentation of the visual stimulus and electrical PBR-stimulation. The major finding was that PBR-stimulation gave an advancement of the dynamic change of the RF-center width such that the different response components occurred earlier. Consistent with previous studies, we also found that PBR-stimulation increased the gain of firing rate during the sustained response component. However, this increase of gain was particularly strong in the transition from the transient to the sustained component at the time when the center width was minimal. The results suggest that increased modulatory PBR-input not only increase the gain of the geniculocortical transmission, but also contributes to faster dynamics of transmission. We discuss implications for possible effects on visual spatial resolution.

AB  - Abstract
Although much has been learned regarding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of memory reconsolidation, its actual biological function remains unclear. In this work we investigate the possibility that three different mnemonic processes – updating, precision-keeping and trace strengthening – are mediated by reconsolidation in contextual fear conditioning. Reconsolidation involves the activation of calcium channels for the destabilization during the reactivation. Our results show that when memory is reactivated in a situation that does not match the original information, content is modified, i.e., “updated”. However, when the contextual condition matches the original one, memory reactivation contributes either to its strengthening or to the maintenance of its precision content over time. Since the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel antagonist nimodipine blocked these effects, we suggest that reconsolidation is the mechanism supporting these processes.

AB  - Abstract
Sleep is a universal phenomenon in vertebrates, and its loss affects various behaviors. Independent studies have reported that sleep loss increases anxiety; however, the detailed mechanism is unknown. Because sleep deprivation increases noradrenalin (NA), which modulates many behaviors and induces patho-physiological changes, this study utilized zebrafish as a model to investigate whether sleep loss-induced increased anxiety is modulated by NA. Continuous behavioral quiescence for at least 6 s was considered to represent sleep in zebrafish; although some authors termed it as a sleep-like state, in this study we have termed it as sleep. The activity of fish that signified sleep–waking was recorded in light–dark, during continuous dark and light; the latter induced sleep loss in fish. The latency, number of entries, time spent and distance travelled in the light chamber were assessed in a light–dark box test to estimate the anxiety behavior of normal, sleep-deprived and prazosin (PRZ)-treated fish. Zebrafish showed increased waking during light and complete loss of sleep upon continuous exposure to light for 24 h. PRZ significantly increased sleep in normal fish. Sleep-deprived fish showed an increased preference for dark (expression of increased anxiety), and this effect was prevented by PRZ, which increased sleep as well. Our findings suggest that sleep loss-induced anxiety-like behavior in zebrafish is likely to be mediated by NA’s action on the α1-adrenoceptor.

AB  - Abstract
A number of imaging studies have reported neuroanatomical correlates of human intelligence with various morphological characteristics of the cerebral cortex. However, it is not yet clear whether these morphological properties of the cerebral cortex account for human intelligence. We assumed that the complex structure of the cerebral cortex could be explained effectively considering cortical thickness, surface area, sulcal depth and absolute mean curvature together. In 78 young healthy adults (age range: 17–27, male/female: 39/39), we used the full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) and the cortical measurements calculated in native space from each subject to determine how much combining various cortical measures explained human intelligence. Since each cortical measure is thought to be not independent but highly inter-related, we applied partial least square (PLS) regression, which is one of the most promising multivariate analysis approaches, to overcome multicollinearity among cortical measures. Our results showed that 30% of FSIQ was explained by the first latent variable extracted from PLS regression analysis. Although it is difficult to relate the first derived latent variable with specific anatomy, we found that cortical thickness measures had a substantial impact on the PLS model supporting the most significant factor accounting for FSIQ. Our results presented here strongly suggest that the new predictor combining different morphometric properties of complex cortical structure is well suited for predicting human intelligence.

AB  - Abstract
TatCN21 is a membrane permeable calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor derived from the inhibitor protein CaMKIIN. TatCN21 has been used to demonstrate the involvement of CaMKII in a variety of physiological and pathological phenomena, and it also limits excitotoxic damage in neurons. Here we use preembedding immunogold electron microscopy to examine the effect of tatCN21 on the redistribution of CaMKII in cultured hippocampal neurons. Incubation of cultures with tatCN21 (20 μM for 20 min) prior to exposure to N-methyl-d-asparic acid (NMDA) (50 μM for 2 min) inhibited both the accumulation of CaMKII at postsynaptic densities (PSDs) and CaMKII clustering in the dendrites. Under these conditions, CaMKII also formed morphologically distinct aggregates with polyribosomes near the PSD and in dendrites. Formation of these CaMKII–polyribosome aggregates requires the presence of both tatCN21 and calcium, and was augmented upon exposure to high K+ or NMDA. CaMKII–polyribosome aggregates formed consistently with 20 μM tatCN21, but minimally or not at all with 5 μM. However, these aggregates are not induced by another CaMKII inhibitor, KN93. Formation of CaMKII–polyribosome aggregates was completely reversible within 1 h after washout of tatCN21. Effects of tatCN21 were largely restricted to dendrites, with minimal effect in the soma. The effects of tatCN21 on CaMKII distribution can be used to dissect the mechanism of CaMKII involvement in cellular events.

AB  - Abstract
Gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) may play an important role in the hearing process. Cisplatin is an anticancer drug that causes hearing loss and Gingko biloba extracts (EGb 761) have been used as an antioxidant and enhancer for GJIC. The purpose of this study was to examine the efficiency of EGb 761 in protecting against cisplatin-induced apoptosis and disturbance of GJIC. House Ear Institute-Organ of Corti 1 auditory cells were cultured and treated with cisplatin (50 μM) and EGb (300 μg/ml) for 24 h, and then analyzed by immunocytochemistry (Annexin V/propidium iodide) and Western blots. GJIC was evaluated by scrape-loading dye transfer (SLDT). Basal turn organ of Corti (oC) explants from neonatal (p3) rats were exposed to cisplatin (1–10 μM) and EGb (50–400 μg/ml). The number of intact hair cells was counted by co-labeling with phalloidin and MyoVIIa. EGb prevented cisplatin-induced apoptosis in immunostaining and decreased caspase 3 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase bands, which were increased in cisplatin-treated cells in Western blots. EGb prevented abnormal intracellular locations of connexin (Cx) 26, 30, 31, and 43 in cells treated with cisplatin and increased quantities of Cx bands. EGb also prevented cisplatin-induced disturbance of GJIC in SLDT. In oC explants, EGb significantly prevented hair cell damage induced by cisplatin. In animal studies, EGb significantly prevented cisplatin-induced hearing loss across 16 and 32 kHz. These results show that cisplatin induces ototoxicity including hearing loss as well as down-regulation of GJIC and inhibition of Cxs in auditory cells. EGb prevents hearing loss in cisplatin-treated rats by inhibiting down-regulation of Cx expression and GJIC. The disturbance of GJIC or Cx expression may be one of the important mechanisms of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity.

AB  - Abstract
To capture patterns in the environment, neurons in the auditory brainstem rapidly alter their firing based on the statistical properties of the soundscape. How this neural sensitivity relates to behavior is unclear. We tackled this question by combining neural and behavioral measures of statistical learning, a general-purpose learning mechanism governing many complex behaviors including language acquisition. We recorded complex auditory brainstem responses (cABRs) while human adults implicitly learned to segment patterns embedded in an uninterrupted sound sequence based on their statistical characteristics. The brainstem’s sensitivity to statistical structure was measured as the change in the cABR between a patterned and a pseudo-randomized sequence composed from the same set of sounds but differing in their sound-to-sound probabilities. Using this methodology, we provide the first demonstration that behavioral-indices of rapid learning relate to individual differences in brainstem physiology. We found that neural sensitivity to statistical structure manifested along a continuum, from adaptation to enhancement, where cABR enhancement (patterned &gt; pseudo-random) tracked with greater rapid statistical learning than adaptation. Short- and long-term auditory experiences (days to years) are known to promote brainstem plasticity and here we provide a conceptual advance by showing that the brainstem is also integral to rapid learning occurring over minutes.

AB  - Abstract
The amygdaloid complex, or amygdala, has been implicated in assigning emotional significance to sensory information and producing appropriate behavioral responses to external stimuli. The lateral and basal nuclei (lateral and basal amygdala), which are termed together as basolateral amygdala, play a critical role in emotional and motivational learning and memory. It has been established that the basolateral amygdala activation by behavioral manipulations or direct electrical stimulation can modulate hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a putative cellular mechanism of memory. However, the specific functional role of each subnucleus in the modulation of hippocampal LTP has not been studied yet, even though studies have shown cytoarchitectural differences between the basal and lateral amygdala and differences in the connections of each one of them to other brain areas. In this study we have tested the effects of lateral or basal amygdala pre-stimulation on hippocampal dentate gyrus LTP, induced by theta burst stimulation of the perforant path, in anesthetized rats. We found that while priming stimulation of the lateral amygdala did not affect LTP of the dentate gyrus, priming stimulation of the basal amygdala enhanced the LTP response when the priming stimulation was relatively weak, but impaired it when it was relatively strong. These results show that the basal and lateral nuclei of the amygdala, which have been already shown to differ in their anatomy and connectivity, may also have different functional roles. These findings raise the possibility that the lateral and basal amygdala differentially modulate memory processes in the hippocampus under emotional and motivational situations.

AB  - Abstract
Repetition suppression (RS) in cortical sensory systems optimizes the size of neuronal ensemble reacting to repetitive stimuli such as sounds. Recently RS has also been demonstrated to occur with mental imaging of movement. We studied the existence of RS in the motor system using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Six healthy subjects participated in this study. TMS was focused on the primary motor cortex with neuronavigation and RS was studied by measuring the motor-evoked potentials from the contralateral first dorsal interosseous muscle. At the same time, we measured TMS-induced cortical responses using electroencephalography (EEG). For a comparison baseline, we evaluated RS by recording EEG responses to sounds with the same stimulation protocol as with TMS. Each stimulus train included four identical stimuli repeated at 1-s intervals, and the stimulation trains were repeated at 20-s intervals. The response amplitude was reduced significantly (p &lt; .01) after the first stimulus in all stimulus trains. This suggests that RS may be a general mechanism for adaptation of neuronal population responses in the human cortex.

AB  - Abstract
Angiotensin II (Ang II) in the periphery and within the brain plays important roles in blood pressure control. Circulating angiotensin is normally excluded from the brain by the blood–brain barrier (BBB), but there is evidence that in some diseases there is disruption of the BBB that could allow circulating Ang II to access nuclei from which it is normally excluded, such as the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). We therefore investigated whether disruption of the BBB leads to increased activation by circulating Ang II of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-containing neurons in the RVLM. In anaesthetised rats, in which the BBB was disrupted with intracarotid hypertonic mannitol (1.6 M, 2 mL/kg), subsequent intracarotid infusion of a subpressor dose of Ang II (5 ng/kg) activated ∼24% of TH-containing RVLM neurons whereas saline only activated ∼8% of TH neurons. Intracarotid pretreatment with the Ang II receptor type 1 (AT1R) blocker, losartan (20 μg/kg), significantly reduced the number of TH cells activated to ∼11% (P &lt; 0.05, one-way analysis of variance, n = 5). In summary, disruption of the BBB resulted in increased activation by circulating Ang II of TH-containing cells in the RVLM. The activation was reduced by losartan indicating a specific action on AT1Rs. These results suggest that disruption of the BBB allows entry of circulating Ang II into the RVLM, which could increase sympathetic outflow. This potential source of Ang II within the RVLM might be an important consideration when assessing sympathetic nerve activity in disease states associated with a compromised BBB.

AB  - Abstract
Propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) has been shown to attenuate neuronal injury under a number of experimental conditions; however, the mechanisms involved in its neuroprotective effects remain unclear. We therefore investigated whether inhibition of p53 induction by propofol contributes to the neuroprotection of cerebral ischemic cell death through both autophagic and apoptotic mechanisms. A transient global cerebral ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) model was produced with a 10-min, 2-vessel occlusion. The change in target genes including damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM), microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), Beclin 1, cathepsin D, cathepsin B, p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), Bax and Bcl-2 upon p53 inhibition was assessed with the co-administration of the intravenous anesthetic propofol and 3-methyladenine (3-MA), Pifithrin-alpha (PFT-α) or SN50. The I/R-induced increases of protein levels of p53 and LC3-II were significantly inhibited by treatment with propofol, 3-MA or PFT-α. The I/R-induced increases of protein levels of DRAM, Beclin 1, active cathepsin D and cathepsin B were significantly inhibited by treatment with propofol, PFT-α or SN50. The negative effects of the I/R-induced up-regulation of PUMA and Bax and the down-regulation of Bcl-2 in the rat hippocampus were all blocked by treatment with propofol, PFT-α or SN50. Our results suggest that cerebral I/R can induce nuclear factor-kappa B-dependent expression of p53. The autophagic and apoptotic mechanisms participate in programed cell death by regulating the p53-mediated pathway. Our results are the first to show that propofol, at clinically relevant concentrations, attenuated cell death through both autophagic and apoptotic mechanisms in the rat hippocampus after a cerebral I/R insult.

AB  - Abstract
The feedback connections from the cortical middle temporal (MT) motion area, to layer 6 of the primary visual cortex (V1), have the capacity to drive a cascaded feedback influence from the layer 6 cortico-geniculate cells back to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) relay cells. This introduces the possibility of a re-entrant motion signal affecting the relay of the retinal input through the LGN to the visual cortex. The question is whether the response of LGN cells to moving stimuli involves a component derived from this feedback. By producing a reversible focal pharmacological block of the activity of an MT direction column we show the presence of such an influence from MT on the responses of magno, parvo and koniocellular cells in the macaque LGN. The pattern of effect in the LGN reflects the direction bias of the MT location inactivated. This suggests a moving stimulus is captured by iterative interactions in the circuit formed by visual cortical areas and visual thalamus.

AB  - Abstract
Recent in vivo data show ensemble activity in medial entorhinal neurons that demonstrates ‘look-ahead’ activity, decoding spatially to reward locations ahead of a rat deliberating at a choice point while performing a cued, appetitive T-Maze task. To model this experiment’s look-ahead results, we adapted previous work that produced a model where scans along equally probable directions activated place cells, associated reward cells, grid cells, and persistent spiking cells along those trajectories. Such look-ahead activity may be a function of animals performing scans to reduce ambiguity while making decisions. In our updated model, look-ahead scans at the choice point can activate goal-associated reward and place cells, which indicate the direction the virtual rat should turn at the choice point. Hebbian associations between stimulus and reward cell layers are learned during training trials, and the reward and place layers are then used during testing to retrieve goal-associated cells based on cue presentation. This system creates representations of location and associated reward information based on only two inputs of heading and speed information which activate grid cell and place cell layers. We present spatial and temporal decoding of grid cell ensembles as rats are tested with perfect and imperfect stimuli. Here, the virtual rat reliably learns goal locations through training sessions and performs both biased and unbiased look-ahead scans at the choice point. Spatial and temporal decoding of simulated medial entorhinal activity indicates that ensembles are representing forward reward locations when the animal deliberates at the choice point, emulating in vivo results.

Dysfunction in generation or control of APAs is associated with postural deficits in some human patients with cerebellar damage. To examine the role of the cerebellum in APAs, we investigated a conditional transgenic mouse of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3Tg) that has defective cerebellar Purkinje cells. Kinematic analyses and monitoring of electromyographic activities during quadrupedal standing showed that SCA3Tg mice exhibited greater hindlimb instability than wild-type (WT) mice. This instability increased during a reaching task that required postural adjustments associated with voluntary neck movements. Normally, the activities of the hindlimb muscles are synchronized with those in the neck that are the agonists for movement of the head in this reaching task; however, in SCA3Tg mice, activities in the hindlimbs were markedly delayed compared to the neck. These observations cannot simply be explained as a secondary outcome of the muscle atrophy that occurs in SCA3Tg mice. In WT mice with muscle atrophy induced by immobilization of the hindlimbs, we did not find impairment of APAs. These findings suggest that the deficits in APAs during the reaching task in SCA3Tg mice were not due to muscle atrophy in the hindlimbs, but were mainly caused by cerebellar degeneration. Therefore, we conclude that the cerebellum is critically involved in APAs.

AB  - Abstract
Folate deficiency has been linked to neurodegenerative and stress-related diseases such as stroke, dementia and depression. The role of the neurotrophins nerve growth factor (NGF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) in stress-related disorders and neurodegeneration has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Uracil misincorporation is involved in the neuropsychiatric dysfunction induced by experimental folate deprivation. However, the effects of folate deficiency on the expression of NGF and NT-3 in brain tissue have not yet been investigated. In a 2 × 2 design, aged mice lacking uracil-DNA N-glycosylase (Ung−/−) versus wild-type (Ung+/+) controls were subjected to a folate-deficient diet versus a regular diet for three months. Independent of genotype, folate deficiency led to decreased NGF protein levels in the frontal cortex and amygdala. In the hippocampus, NGF levels were increased in UNG−/− mice on the normal diet, but not under folate deficiency, while in UNG+/+ mice, folate deprivation did not affect hippocampal NGF content. NT-3 protein concentrations were neither affected by genotype nor by folate deficiency. Altogether, the results of our study show that folate deficiency affects NGF levels in the frontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus. The decrease in NGF content in the hippocampus in response to folate deficiency in Ung−/− mice may contribute to their phenotype of enhanced anxiety and despair-like behavior as well as to selective hippocampal neurodegeneration.

AB  - Abstract
Central neuropathic pain (CNP) in the spinal cord, such as chronic pain after spinal cord injury (SCI), is an incurable ailment. However, little is known about the spinal cord mechanisms underlying CNP. Recently, reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been recognized to play an important role in CNP of the spinal cord. However, it is unclear how ROS affect synaptic transmission in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. To clarify how ROS impact on synaptic transmission, we investigated the effects of ROS on synaptic transmission in rat spinal cord substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurons using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Administration of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH), an ROS donor, into the spinal cord markedly increased the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in SG neurons. This t-BOOH-induced enhancement was not suppressed by the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin. However, in the presence of a non-N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, t-BOOH did not generate any sEPSCs. Furthermore, in the presence of a transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channel antagonist (HC-030031) or a transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel antagonist (capsazepine or AMG9810), the t-BOOH-induced increase in the frequency of sEPSCs was inhibited. These results indicate that ROS enhance the spontaneous release of glutamate from presynaptic terminals onto SG neurons through TRPA1 and TRPV1 channel activation. Excessive activation of these ion channels by ROS may induce central sensitization in the spinal cord and result in chronic pain such as that following SCI.

AB  - Abstract
When our movement is perturbed by environmental forces, the Long Latency Stretch Reflex (LLSR), generated by a transcortical loop through the primary motor cortex (M1), is the fastest reaction adapted according to our prior intent. We investigated the involvement of the caudal part of the Supplementary Motor Area (SMAp) in this intention-related LLSR modulation. Subjects were instructed either to not react (i.e. to ‘let-go’) or to resist a mechanical perturbation extending the wrist and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) was used to transiently inactivate SMAp, either at the time of the LLSR generation (TMS was applied 50 ms before the perturbation), or at the end of the preparation period (TMS was applied 150 ms before the perturbation). The effect of SMAp transient inactivation on the LLSR modulation was compared to the effect of transient inactivation of M1 or of a Control area. Compared to the Control condition, the intention-related LLSR modulation decreased when TMS was applied either over SMAp or over M1 50 ms before perturbation occurrence, suggesting that SMAp, as M1, is involved in the LLSR modulation. Moreover, the LLSR modulation also decreased when TMS was applied over SMAp 150 ms before the perturbation, indicating that anticipatory processes taking place in SMAp participate to the LLSR modulation. In addition, TMS applied over SMAp elicited Motor-Evoked Potentials (MEPs) whose latency and shape were similar to MEPs evoked by TMS over M1, suggesting that they are due to direct corticospinal projections from SMAp. Interestingly, the SMAp MEPs amplitude was modulated depending on the subject’s intention to resist or to let-go. Taken together these results strongly favor the idea that, during the expectation of a perturbation, SMAp is the seat of anticipatory processes that are specific to the subject’s intent and that preset M1 in order to adapt the LLSR to this intention.

AB  - Abstract
Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), we examined proteomic changes in the caudal part of the spinal trigeminal nucleus induced by electrical stimulation of the dura mater surrounding the superior sagittal sinus (ES-SSS) in conscious rats. After image analysis of 2-DE gels, nine protein spots of interest were excised from the gels and identified by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Among the nine, succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) was found to be down-regulated after ES-SSS. This result was validated with Real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses. Because SSADH degrades GABA, decreased expression of it increases the local concentration of GABA in the caudal part of the spinal trigeminal nucleus after ES-SSS; this has not been reported before and may participate in the modulation of trigeminovascular headache.

AB  - Abstract
In adult animals, the cerebellum is richly innervated by serotonin: serotonergic fibres are the third main afferent fibres into the cerebellum. However, the physiology of the serotonergic system and its functional significance are not fully known during development in the cerebellum. In this review we will focus on the serotonergic regulation of the cerebellum during postnatal development. We hypothesize a powerful role for serotonin in the physiology of the developing cerebellum. A presumably tonic activation of serotonin receptors by binding of serotonin becomes specific by temporally and spatially restricted expression of different serotonin receptors, each with their own (sometimes antagonizing) functions. During the first postnatal week, activation of 5-HT1 receptors expressed by both granule cells and Purkinje cells stimulates dendritic growth and synapse formation. Later, activation of 5-HT3 receptors expressed by granule cells limits dendritic growth of Purkinje cells via mediating the secretion of reelin, influences physiological maturation of Purkinje cells, modulates synaptic plasticity at parallel fibre–Purkinje cell synapses and thereby affects competition with the climbing fibres on Purkinje cell dendrites resulting in proper climbing fibre elimination. Last, activation of 5-HT2 receptors expressed by granule cells and Purkinje cells both during late postnatal development and in the mature cerebellum promotes the stability of synaptic activity. Thus, we propose that serotonin controls cerebellar development in three phases: (1) stimulation of dendritic growth and formation of synapses, (2) hard-wiring of neuronal connections with limits to dendritic growth but ensuring synaptic plasticity, and (3) stabilization of synapses. Taken together, serotonin receptors expressed by different cells in the cerebellum have a specialized role during postnatal development, but with some similar main effects. Distinct spatial and temporal expression of these receptors gives serotonin a powerful and specific role in cerebellar development.

AB  - Abstract
In the last decade, early-onset of affective illness has been recognized as a major public health problem. However, clinical studies indicate that although children experience the symptoms of anxiety and depression in much the same way as adults, they display and react to those symptoms differently (Bostic et al., 2005). Recently, we have demonstrated that similar differences in symptoms are found also between adult and juvenile rats (Jacobson-Pick and Richter-Levin, 2010). Especially the hippocampus is believed to be vulnerable to stress-related illness, as this brain region has a high density of corticoid receptors. The hippocampus is known to finalize its development, and particularly that of GABA-related functions, into adolescence (Bergmann et al., 1991; Harris et al., 1992; Nurse and Lacaille, 1999; Lopez-Tellez et al., 2004; Jacobson-Pick et al., 2008) and may thus be differentially sensitive to environmental challenges in childhood and in adulthood. In this study we explored the differences in activity and plasticity of the dentate gyrus between pre-pubertal and adult rats in vivo. Furthermore, we have examined the impact of exposure to stress either during pre-puberty or in adulthood on dentate gyrus electrophysiology. In both male and female rats, marked differences were found for intrinsic excitability and local circuit activity between pre-pubertal and adult animals. Exposure to forced swim stress resulted in significant alterations of dentate gyrus activity and plasticity in male rats with differences between adult and pre-pubertal animals. Stress had far less impact on females’ dentate electrophysiology.

The results are in agreement with the differences in behavioral response to stress between pre-pubertal and adult rats, and with reported differences for the sensitivity of male and female rats in performing hippocampus-dependent tasks under stress, such as the active avoidance task.

AB  - Abstract
The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of smilagenin (SMI) (PYM50028), a sapogenin compound originally identified from Chinese medicinal herb, on dopamine neurons and locomotor ability in aged rats. Experiments were carried out on young and aged Sprague–Dawley rats, which were daily administered with either SMI (18 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (0.5% sodium carboxymethycellulose [CMCNa]). Open-field and rotarod performance tests revealed that behavioral ability was impaired in aged rats and was improved by oral administration of smilagenin. Immunohistochemical data showed that tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neuron numbers in the substantia nigra pars compacta (unbiased stereological counting) were altered with aging and were increased by smilagenin treatment. Likewise, the dopamine receptor density and the striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) density (125I-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl) nortropane [125I-FP-CIT] autoradiography) were significantly lowered in aged rats as compared to young rats, and treatment with smilagenin significantly elevated the dopamine receptor and DAT density in aged rats. Furthermore, smilagenin enhances glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) release both in the striatum and midbrain. These results indicate a possible role of smilagenin in the treatment of age-related extrapyramidal disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Vestibulo-ocular reflexes are the fastest compensatory reflex systems. One of these is the translational vestibulo-ocular reflex (TVOR) which stabilizes the gaze at a given fixation point during whole body translations. For a proper response of the TVOR the eyes have to counter rotate in the head with a velocity that is inversely scaled to viewing distance of the target. It is generally assumed that scaling of the TVOR is automatically coupled to vergence angle at the brainstem level. However, different lines of evidence also argue that in humans scaling of the TVOR also depends on a mechanism that pre-sets gain on a priori knowledge of target distance.

To discriminate between these two possibilities we used a real target paradigm with vergence angle coupled to distance and a virtual target paradigm with vergence angle dissociated from target distance. We compared TVOR responses in six subjects who underwent lateral sinusoidal whole-body translations at 1 and 2 Hz. Real targets varied between distance of 50 and 22.4 cm in front of the subjects, whereas the virtual targets consisting of a green and red light emitting diode (LED) were physically located at 50 cm from the subject. Red and green LED’s were dichoptically viewed. By shifting the red LED relative to the green LED we created a range of virtual viewing distances where vergence angle changed but the ideal kinematic eye velocity was always the same. Eye velocity data recorded with virtual targets were compared to eye velocity data recorded with real targets. We also used flashing targets (flash frequency 1 Hz, duration 5 ms). During the real, continuous visible targets condition scaling of compensatory eye velocity with vergence angle was nearly perfect. During viewing of virtual targets, and with flashed targets compensatory eye velocity only weakly correlated to vergence angle, indicating that vergence angle is only partially coupled to compensatory eye velocity during translation. Our data suggest that in humans vergence angle as a measure of target distance estimation has only limited use for automatic TVOR scaling.

AB  - Abstract
Schizophrenia is a severe condition that has been associated with functional abnormalities in dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Neurokinin-3 receptors (NK3Rs) of the tachykinin family of neuropeptides modulate the activity of VTA DA neurons and might be involved in DA abnormalities relevant to schizophrenia. Recent work from our lab showed that systemic injection of the dopamine D1/D2 receptor agonist apomorphine in rats, which mimics schizophrenia-like behaviors in humans, also evoked a redistribution of NK3Rs in DA neurons of the rat VTA. In the present study, VTA microinjection of the selective NK3R antagonist SB222200 (1 nmol/0.2 μl) or the nuclear import blocker SN50 (2 μg/0.2 μl) was performed in awake rats 10 min prior to systemic injection of apomorphine. VTA sections were dual immunolabeled for the NK3R (immunogold) and the dopamine synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, immunoperoxidase). Electron microscopic quantifications of somatic and dendritic densities of NK3 immunogold particles were compared in rats receiving central and systemic injections. In DA (TH-labeled) dendrites, VTA microinjection of SB222200 prevented the apomorphine-evoked decrease in surface NK3R density as well as the apomorphine-induced increase in cytoplasmic NK3R density. In contrast, VTA microinjection of SN50, but not SB222200, prevented the apomorphine-induced increase in nuclear NK3R density. VTA microinjection of SB222200 or SN50 without apomorphine had no effect on the NK3R distribution or density in TH and non-TH profiles within the VTA. In non-TH, presumably GABAergic neurons of the VTA, the NK3R densities in somata and dendrites were not significantly changed by apomorphine with or without SB222200. The results suggest that the NK3R antagonist SB222200 is effective against the apomorphine-evoked NK3R internalization in VTA DA dendrites, but does not prevent nuclear NK3R trafficking in VTA DA neurons. These results might have important implications in targeting NK3R antagonists in basic or clinical studies.

In the present study, we investigated the multisensory gain as the difference of speech recognition accuracies between the audio–visual (AV) and auditory-only (A) conditions, and the multisensory gain as the difference between the event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked under the AV condition and the sum of the ERPs evoked under the A and visual-only (V) conditions in different noise environments. Videos of a female speaker articulating the Chinese monosyllable words accompanied with different levels of pink noise were used as the stimulus materials. The selected signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) were −16, −12, −8, −4 and 0 dB. Under the A, V and AV conditions the accuracy of the speech recognition was measured and the ERPs evoked under different conditions were analyzed, respectively. The behavioral results showed that the maximum gain as the difference of speech recognition accuracies between the AV and A conditions was at the −12 dB SNR. The ERP results showed that the multisensory gain as the difference between the ERPs evoked under the AV condition and the sum of ERPs evoked under the A and V conditions at the −12 dB SNR was significantly higher than those at the other SNRs in the time window of 130–200 ms in the area from frontal to central region. The multisensory gains in audio–visual speech recognition at different SNRs were not completely accordant with the principle of inverse effectiveness, but confirmed to cross-modal stochastic resonance.

AB  - Abstract
A growing interest in sensory system plasticity in the natural context of motherhood has created the need to investigate how intrinsic physiological state (e.g., hormonal, motivational, etc.) interacts with sensory experience to drive adaptive cortical plasticity for behaviorally relevant stimuli. Using a maternal mouse model of auditory cortical inhibitory plasticity for ultrasonic pup calls, we examined the role of pup care versus maternal physiological state in the long-term retention of this plasticity. Very recent experience caring for pups by Early Cocarers, which are virgins, produced stronger call-evoked lateral-band inhibition in auditory cortex. However, this plasticity was absent when measured post-weaning in Cocarers, even though it was present at the same time point in Mothers, whose pup experience occurred under a maternal physiological state. A two-alternative choice phonotaxis task revealed that the same animal groups (Early Cocarers and Mothers) demonstrating stronger lateral-band inhibition also preferred pup calls over a neutral sound, a correlation consistent with the hypothesis that this inhibitory mechanism may play a mnemonic role and is engaged to process sounds that are particularly salient. Our electrophysiological data hint at a possible mechanism through which the maternal physiological state may act to preserve the cortical plasticity: selectively suppressing detrimental spontaneous activity in neurons that are responsive to calls, an effect observed only in Mothers. Taken together, the maternal physiological state during the care of pups may help maintain the memory trace of behaviorally salient infant cues within core auditory cortex, potentially ensuring a more rapid induction of future maternal behavior.

AB  - Abstract
Withdrawal from opiates, such as heroin or oral narcotics, is characterized by a host of aversive physical and emotional symptoms. High rates of relapse and limited treatment success rates for opiate addiction have prompted a search for new approaches. For many opiate addicts, achieving abstinence may be further complicated by poly-drug use and co-morbid mental disorders. Research over the past decade has shed light on the influence of endocannabinoids (ECs) on the opioid system. Evidence from both animal and clinical studies point toward an interaction between these two systems, and suggest that targeting the EC system may provide novel interventions for managing opiate dependence and withdrawal. This review will summarize the literature surrounding the molecular effects of cannabinoids and opioids on the locus coeruleus–norepinephrine system, a key circuit implicated in the negative sequelae of opiate addiction. A consideration of the trends and effects of marijuana use in those seeking treatment to abstain from opiates in the clinical setting will also be presented. In summary, the present review details how cannabinoid–opioid interactions may inform novel interventions in the management of opiate dependence and withdrawal.

AB  - Abstract
Pseudoephedrine (PSE) salts (hydrochloride and sulfate) are commonly used as nasal and paranasal decongestants by scuba divers. Anecdotal reports from the Divers Alert Network suggest that taking PSE prior to diving while breathing pure O2 increases the risk for CNS oxygen toxicity (CNS-OT), which manifests as seizures. We hypothesized that high doses of PSE reduce the latency time to seizure (LS) in unanesthetized rats breathing 5 atmospheres absolute (ATA) of hyperbaric oxygen. Sixty-three male rats were implanted with radio-transmitters that recorded electroencephalogram activity and body temperature. After ⩾7-day recovery, and 2 h before “diving”, each rat was administered either saline solution (control) or PSE hydrochloride intragastrically at the following doses (mg PSE/kg): 0, 40, 80, 100, 120, 160, and 320. Rats breathed pure O2 and were dived to 5 ATA until the onset of behavioral seizures coincident with neurological seizures. LS was the time elapsed between reaching 5 ATA and exhibiting seizures. We observed a significant dose-dependent decrease in the LS at doses of 100–320 mg/kg, whereas no significant differences in LS from control value were observed at doses ⩽80 mg/kg. Our findings showed that high doses of PSE accelerate the onset of CNS-OT seizures in unanesthetized rats breathing 5 ATA of poikilocapnic hyperoxia. Extrapolating our findings to humans, we conclude that the recommended daily dose of PSE should not be abused prior to diving with oxygen-enriched gas mixes or pure O2.

AB  - Abstract
Startle pathways may contribute to rapid accomplishment of postural stability. Here we investigate the possible influence of a startling auditory stimulus (SAS) on postural responses. We formulated four specific questions: (1) can a concurrent SAS shorten the onset of automatic postural responses?; and if so (2) is this effect different for forward versus backward perturbations?; (3) does this effect depend on prior knowledge of the perturbation direction?; and (4) is this effect different for low- and high-magnitude perturbations?

Balance was perturbed in 11 healthy participants by a movable platform that suddenly translated forward or backward. Each participant received 160 perturbations, 25% of which were combined with a SAS. We varied the direction and magnitude of the perturbations, as well as the prior knowledge of perturbation direction. Perturbation trials were interspersed with SAS-only trials.

The SAS accelerated and strengthened postural responses with clear functional benefits (better balance control), but this was only true for responses that protected against falling backwards (i.e. in tibialis anterior and rectus femoris). These muscles also demonstrated the most common SAS-triggered responses without perturbation. Increasing the perturbation magnitude accelerated postural responses, but again with a larger acceleration for backward perturbations.

We conclude that postural responses to backward and forward perturbations may be processed by different neural circuits, with influence of startle pathways on postural responses to backward perturbations. These findings give directions for future studies investigating whether deficits in startle pathways may explain the prominent backward instability seen in patients with Parkinson’s disease and progressive supranuclear palsy.

AB  - Abstract
Reticulospinal (RS) neurons are critical for initiation of locomotor behavior, and following spinal cord injury (SCI) in the lamprey, the axons of these neurons regenerate and restore locomotor behavior within a few weeks. For lamprey RS neurons in culture, experimental induction of calcium influx, either in the growth cone or cell body, is inhibitory for neurite outgrowth. Following SCI, these neurons partially downregulate calcium channel expression, which would be expected to reduce calcium influx and possibly provide supportive conditions for axonal regeneration. In the present study, it was tested whether activation of second messenger signaling pathways stimulates neurite outgrowth of lamprey RS neurons without altering their electrical properties (e.g. spike broadening) so as to possibly increase calcium influx and compromise axonal growth. First, activation of cAMP pathways with forskolin or dbcAMP stimulated neurite outgrowth of RS neurons in culture in a PKA-dependent manner, while activation of cGMP signaling pathways with dbcGMP inhibited outgrowth. Second, neurophysiological recordings from uninjured RS neurons in isolated lamprey brain–spinal cord preparations indicated that dbcAMP or dbcGMP did not significantly affect any of the measured electrical properties. In contrast, for uninjured RS neurons, forskolin increased action potential duration, which might have increased calcium influx, but did not significantly affect most other electrical properties. Importantly, for injured RS neurons during the period of axonal regeneration, forskolin did not significantly alter their electrical properties. Taken together, these results suggest that activation of cAMP signaling by dbcAMP stimulates neurite outgrowth, but does not alter the electrical properties of lamprey RS neurons in such a way that would be expected to induce calcium influx. In conclusion, our results suggest that activation of cAMP pathways alone, without compensation for possible deleterious effects on electrical properties, is an effective approach for stimulating axonal regeneration of RS neuron following SCI.

AB  - Abstract
In addition to androgen differences between males and females, there are genetic differences that are caused by unequal dosage of sex chromosome genes. Using the cuprizone-induced demyelination model, we recently showed that surgical gonadectomy of adult mice resulted in decreased normal myelination and remyelination compared to gonadally intact animals, suggesting a supporting role for sex hormones in the maintenance of myelination. However, inherent sex differences in normal myelination and remyelination persisted even after gonadectomy, with males consistently remyelinating to a lesser extent relative to normal myelination as assayed by axon conduction and immunohistochemistry. This suggests a potential role for the sex chromosome complement in mediating the differential rates of remyelination observed in males and females. The present study focuses on the impact that sex chromosomes might have on these myelination differences. Making use of the four core-genotype mice and cuprizone-diet induced demyelination/remyelination paradigm, our results demonstrate sex chromosome-mediated asymmetry between XX and XY mice. The rate of functional remyelination following cuprizone diet-induced callosal demyelination in four core-genotype mice is attenuated in XY compared to XX animals of both gonadal sexes. Importantly, this difference arises only in the absence of circulating sex hormones following gonadectomy and confirms the role of sex hormones in the remyelination process reported earlier by our group. Because a genotype-mediated difference only arises following gonadectomy, the chromosomal contribution to myelination and remyelination is subtle yet significant. To explain this difference, we propose a possible asymmetry in the expression of myelination-related genes in XX vs. XY mice that needs to be investigated in future studies.

AB  - Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) initiates a cascade of processes that ultimately form a nonpermissive environment for axonal regeneration. Emerging evidence suggests that regenerative failure may be due in part to inhibitory factors expressed by reactive spinal cord glial cells and meningeal fibroblasts, such as the Eph receptor protein-tyrosine kinases and their corresponding ligands (ephrins). Here we sought to assess the role of ephrin B2, an inhibitory axonal guidance molecule, as an inhibitor of the recovery process following SCI. To determine the extent of ephrin B2 involvement in axonal regenerative failure, a SCI model was performed on a conditional ephrin B2 knockout mouse strain (ephrin B2−/−), in which the ephrin B2 gene was deleted under the GFAP promoter . The expression of ephrin B2 was significantly decreased in astrocytes of injured and uninjured ephrin B2−/− mice compared to wild-type mice. Notably, in the ephrin B2−/− mice, the deletion of ephrin B2 reduced astrogliosis, and accelerated motor function recovery after SCI. Anterograde axonal tracing on a hemisection model of SCI further showed that ephrin B2−/− mice exhibited increased regeneration of injured corticospinal axons and a reduced glial scar, when compared to littermate controls exposed to similar injury. These results were confirmed by an in vitro neurite outgrowth assay and ephrin B2 functional blockage, which showed that ephrin B2 expressed on astrocytes inhibited axonal growth. Combined these findings suggest that ephrin B2 ligands expressed by reactive astrocytes impede the recovery process following SCI.

The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different training types and secondary to test gender differences on the training-related cortical plasticity induced by three different tongue-training paradigms: (1) therapeutic tongue exercises (TTE), (2) playing computer games with the tongue using the Tongue Drive System (TDS) and (3) tongue-protrusion task (TPT). Forty-eight participants were randomized into three groups with 1 h of TTE, TDS, or TPT. Stimulus–response curves of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and motor cortex mapping for tongue muscles and first dorsal interosseous (FDI) (control) were established using transcranial magnetic stimulation at three time-points: (1) before tongue-training, (2) immediately after training, (3) 1 h after training. Subject-based reports of motivation, fun, pain and fatigue were evaluated on 0–10 numerical rating scales after training. The resting motor thresholds of tongue MEPs were lowered by training with TDS and TPT (P &lt; 0.011) but not by TTE (P = 0.167). Tongue MEP amplitudes increased after training with TDS and TPT (P &lt; 0.030) but not with TTE (P = 0.302). Men had higher MEPs than women in the TDS group (P &lt; 0.045) at all time-points. No significant effect of tongue-training on FDI MEPs was observed (P &gt; 0.335). The tongue cortical motor map areas were not significantly increased by training (P &gt; 0.142). Training with TDS was most motivating and fun (P &lt; 0.001) and TTE was rated the most painful (P &lt; 0.001). Fatigue level was not different between groups (P &gt; 0.071). These findings suggest a differential effect of tongue-training paradigms on training-induced cortical plasticity and subject-based scores of fun, motivation and pain in healthy participants.

AB  - Abstract
Several brain-imaging and lesion studies have suggested a role for the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in computing interval-timing tasks. PPC also seems to have a key role in modulating visuospatial mechanisms, which are known to affect temporal performance. By applying transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left and right PPC, we aimed to modulate timing ability performance in healthy humans performing a cognitively controlled timing task. In two separate experiments we compared time-processing abilities of two groups of healthy adults submitted to anodal, cathodal or sham tDCS over right or left PPC, by employing a supra-second time reproduction task. Cathodal stimulation over the right PPC affected temporal accuracy by leading participants to overestimate time intervals. Moreover, when applied to the left PPC, it reduced variability in reproducing temporal intervals. No effect was reported for anodal stimulation. These results expand current knowledge on the role of the parietal cortex on temporal processing. We provide evidence that the parietal cortex of both hemispheres is involved in temporal processing by acting on distinct components of timing performance such as accuracy and variability.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic stress exacerbates and can induce symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders. Chronic stress causes amygdala hyperactivity, which may contribute to these detrimental effects. One potential mechanism for amygdala hyperactivity is an increase of excitatory drive after stress. Excitatory inputs to the amygdala predominantly synapse upon dendritic spines, and repeated stress has been demonstrated to increase dendritic spines in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). However, the BLA is comprised of several nuclei, including the lateral nucleus (LAT) and the basal nucleus (BA), which exert functionally distinct roles in amygdala-dependent behaviors. Furthermore, while an increase of dendritic spines can impart significant functional ramifications, a shift of spine distribution can also exert significant impact. However, differences in the effects of repeated stress on LAT and BA have not been examined, nor differential effects on spine distribution. This study examined the effects of repeated restraint stress on dendritic structure of principal neurons from the LAT and BA in Golgi-stained tissue. This study found that repeated stress increased spine number in LAT and BA, but in very distinct patterns, with proximal increases in LAT neurons and non-proximal increases in BA neurons. Furthermore, repeated stress increased dendritic length in the BA, but not the LAT, leading to a global change of spine density in BA, but a focal change in LAT. These distinct effects of repeated stress in the LAT and BA may exert significant functional effects on fear behavior, and may underlie differences in the effects of repeated stress on acquisition, contextual modulation and extinction of fear behavior.

AB  - Abstract
Previous research demonstrated that rotenone (RT) induces neuronal injury partially by increasing intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i), and inducing oxidative stress, leading to a neurodegenerative disorder. However, the mechanism of RT-induced injury remains elusive. Recent work revealed that Ca2+ signaling is important for RT-induced senescence in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. In the present study, we found that in SH-SY5Y cells, RT increased [Ca2+]i, senescence associated β-galactosidase activity, aggregation of lipofuscin, production of reactive oxygen species, G1/G0 cell cycle arrest, and activation of p53/p21signaling proteins. In addition, RT decreased the expression of the signaling proteins for cell proliferation and survival, Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), cyclin D1, and Akt. Pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with isradipine, an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, or EGTA antagonized these effects of RT. These results suggested that application of isradipine might be a novel approach to prevent RT-induced neurodegenerative disorder such as Parkinson’s disease.

AB  - Abstract
Goal-directed reaching is important for the activities of daily living. Populations of neurons in the primary motor cortex that project to spinal motor circuits are known to represent the kinematics of reaching movements. We investigated whether repetitive practice of goal-directed reaching movements induces use-dependent plasticity of those kinematic characteristics, in a manner similar to finger movements, as had been shown previously. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to evoke upper extremity movements while the forearm was resting in a robotic cradle. Plasticity was measured by the change in kinematics of these evoked movements following goal-directed reaching practice. Baseline direction of TMS-evoked arm movements was determined for each subject. Subjects then practiced three blocks of 160 goal-directed reaching movements in a direction opposite to the baseline direction (14 cm reach 180° from baseline direction) against a 75-Nm spring field. Changes in TMS-evoked whole arm movements were assessed after each practice block and after 5 min following the end of practice. Direction and the position of the point of peak velocity of TMS-evoked movements were significantly altered following training and at a 5-min interval following training, while amplitude did not show significant changes. This was accompanied by changes in the motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) of the shoulder and elbow agonist muscles that partly explained the change in direction, mainly by increase in agonist MEP, without significant changes in antagonists. These findings demonstrate that the arm representation accessible by motor cortical stimulation under goes rapid plasticity induced by goal-directed robotic reach training in healthy subjects.

AB  - Abstract
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and devastating neurodegenerative disease caused by selective degeneration and death of motor neurons. So far very limited therapeutic options have emerged to treat this fatal disease. Homocysteine (Hcy) lowering drugs have been suggested to be a palliative therapy of this disease. Folate, Vitamin B12 (VitB12) and Vitamin B6 (VitB6) are important elements involved in the Hcy metabolism and we proposed that medications which could promote the absorption of folate, VitB12 and VitB6 might have benefit for ALS. Galactooligosaccharides (GOS) is a prebiotic which could significantly improve the absorption and syntheses of B Vitamins. To investigate whether GOS could provide neuroprotective effect in ALS, we applied GOS and GOS-rich prebiotic yogurt in SOD1G93A mice and assessed their effects on the disease progression of ALS. Our results showed that GOS and prebiotics yogurt administration significantly delayed the disease onset and prolonged the lifespan in SOD1G93A mice. Also, these products increased the concentration of folate, VitB12 and reduced the level of Hcy. Moreover, we found that both GOS and prebiotics yogurt attenuated motor neurons loss, improved the atrophy and mitochondrial activity in myocyte. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GOS and GOS-rich prebiotic treatment suppressed the activation of astrocytes and microglia and regulated several inflammatory- and apoptosis-related factors. Our findings suggested that GOS might have therapeutic potential for ALS, and GOS-rich prebiotic yogurt might be considered as a nutritional therapy for this disease.

AB  - Abstract
Pain from cancer can be severe, difficult to treat, and greatly diminishes patients’ quality of life. It is therefore important to gain new information on the mechanisms of cancer pain and develop new treatment strategies. We have used a murine model of bone cancer pain to investigate underlying peripheral neural mechanisms and novel treatment approaches. In this model, implantation of fibrosarcoma cells into and around the calcaneous bone produces mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in mice. C-fiber nociceptors in tumor-bearing mice develop spontaneous ongoing activity and sensitization to thermal stimuli. However, it is unclear whether sensitization of nociceptors to mechanical stimuli underlies the mechanical hyperalgesia seen in tumor-bearing mice. We therefore examined responses of C-fiber nociceptors to suprathreshold mechanical stimuli in tumor-bearing mice and found they did not differ from those of C-nociceptors in control mice. Thus, sensitization of C-fiber nociceptors to mechanical stimulation does not appear to underlie tumor-evoked mechanical hyperalgesia in this murine model of bone cancer pain.

We also examined the effect of the non-selective cannabinoid receptor agonist, WIN 55,212-2, on spontaneous activity and responses evoked by mechanical stimuli of C-fiber nociceptors innervating the tumor-bearing paw. Selective CB1 and CB2 antagonists were administered to determine the contribution of each receptor subtype to the effects of WIN 55,212-2. Intraplantar administration of WIN 55,212-2 attenuated spontaneous discharge and responses evoked by mechanical stimulation of C-fiber nociceptors. These effects were inhibited by prior intraplantar administration of selective CB1 (AM281) or CB2 (AM630) receptor antagonists but not by vehicle. These results indicate that activation of either CB1 or CB2 receptors reduced the spontaneous activity of C-fiber nociceptors associated with tumor growth as well as their evoked responses. Our results provide further evidence that activation of peripheral cannabinoid receptors may be a useful target for the treatment of cancer pain.

AB  - Abstract
The intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) is classically known as the area of the Thalamic Lateral Geniculate Complex providing the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) non-photic information. In the present study we investigated whether this information might be related to the metabolic state of the animal. The following groups of male Wistar rats were used for analysis of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and c-Fos in the IGL and SCN. (1) Fed ad libitum. (2) Fasted for 48 h. (3) Fasted for 48 h followed by refeeding for 3 h. (4) Monosodium glutamate-lesioned and 48 h fasted. (5) Electrolytic lesion in the IGL and 48 h fasted. The results were quantified by optical densitometry. Neuronal tracers were injected in two brain areas that receive metabolic information from the periphery, the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and Nucleus of the Tractus Solitarius to investigate whether there is an anatomical relationship with the IGL. Lesion studies showed the IGL, and not the ARC, as origin of most NPY projections to the SCN. Fasting induced important changes in the NPY expression in the IGL, coinciding with similar changes of NPY/glutamate decarboxylase projections of the IGL to the SCN. These changes revealed that the IGL is involved in the transmission of metabolic information to the SCN. In fasted animals IGL lesion resulted in a significant increase of c-Fos in the SCN as compared to intact fasted animals demonstrating the inhibitory influence of the IGL to the SCN in fasting conditions. When the animal after fasting was refed, an increase of c-Fos in the SCN indicated a removal of this inhibitory input. Together these observations show that in addition to increased inhibitory IGL input during fasting, the negative metabolic condition also results in increased excitatory input to the SCN via other pathways. Consequently the present observations show that at least part of the non-photic input to the SCN, arising from the IGL contains information about metabolic conditions.

AB  - Abstract
The mature neocortex is a unique six-layered mammalian brain region. It is composed of morphologically and functionally distinct subpopulations of primary projection neurons that form complex circuits across the central nervous system. The precisely-timed generation of projection neurons from neural stem cells governs their differentiation, postmitotic specification, and signaling, and is critical for cognitive and sensorimotor ability. Developmental perturbations to the birthdate, location, and connectivity of neocortical neurons are observed in neurological and psychiatric disorders. These facts are highlighting the importance of the precise spatiotemporal development of the neocortex regulated by intricate transcriptional, but also complex post-transcriptional events. Indeed, mRNA transcripts undergo many post-transcriptional regulatory steps before the production of functional proteins, which specify neocortical neural stem cells and subpopulations of neocortical neurons. Therefore, particular attention is paid to the differential post-transcriptional regulation of key transcripts by RNA-binding proteins, including splicing, localization, stability, and translation. We also present a transcriptome screen of candidate molecules associated with post-transcriptional mRNA processing that are differentially expressed at key developmental time points across neocortical prenatal neurogenesis.

AB  - Abstract
The article reviews evidence for sensitive periods in the sensory systems and considers their neuronal mechanisms from the viewpoint of the system’s neuroscience. It reviews the essential cortical developmental steps and shows its dependence on experience. It differentiates feature representation and object representation and their neuronal mechanisms. The most important developmental effect of experience is considered to be the transformation of a naive cortical neuronal network into a network capable of categorization, by that establishing auditory objects. The control mechanisms of juvenile and adult plasticity are further discussed. Total absence of hearing experience prevents the patterning of the naive auditory system with subsequent extensive consequences on the auditory function. Additional to developmental changes in synaptic plasticity, other brain functions like corticocortical interareal couplings are also influenced by deprivation. Experiments with deaf auditory systems reveal several integrative effects of deafness and their reversibility with experience. Additional to developmental molecular effects on synaptic plasticity, a combination of several integrative effects of deprivation on brain functions, including feature representation (affecting the starting point for learning), categorization function, top–down interactions and cross-modal reorganization close the sensitive periods and may contribute to their critical nature. Further, non-auditory effects of auditory deprivation are discussed. To reopen critical periods, removal of molecular breaks in synaptic plasticity and focused training therapy on the integrative effects are required.

AB  - AbstractObjective
Glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) maintains low concentrations of extracellular glutamate by removing glutamate from the extracellular space. It is controversial, however, whether upregulation of GLT-1 is neuroprotective under all ischemic/hypoxic conditions. Recently, a neuroprotective effect of preconditioning with a β-lactam antibiotic ceftriaxone (CTX) that increases expression of GLT-1 has been reported in animal models of focal ischemia. On the other hand, it is said that CTX does not play a neuroprotective role in an in vitro study. Thus, we examined the effect of CTX on ischemic injury in a rat model of two-vein occlusion (2VO). This model mimics venous ischemia during, e.g. tumor surgery, a clinical situation that is best suitable for pretreatment with CTX.
Methods
CTX (100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg per day) or vehicle (0.9% NaCl) was intraperitoneally injected into Wistar rats for 5 days before venous ischemia (n = 57). Then, animals were prepared for occlusion of two adjacent cortical veins (2VO) by photothrombosis with rose bengal that was followed by KCl-induced cortical spreading depression (CSD). Infarct volume was evaluated with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining 2 days after venous occlusion. [3H]MK-801, [3H]AMPA and [3H]Muscimol ligand binding were examined autoradiographically in additional two groups without 2VO (n = 5/group). Animals were injected either with NaCl (vehicle) or CTX 200 mg/kg for 5 days in order to evaluate whether NMDA, AMPA and GABAA ligand binding densities were affected.
Results
CTX pretreatment reduced infarct volume compared to vehicle pretreatment (p &lt; 0.05). The effect of CTX pretreatment was attenuated by administration of the GLT-1 inhibitor, dihydrokainate (DHK) 30 min before 2VO. CTX had no effect on the number of spontaneous spreading depressions after 2VO. Analysis of quantitative receptor autoradiography showed no statistically significant difference between rats after administration with CTX compared to control rats.
Conclusions
Pretreatment with CTX has neuroprotective potential without effect on NMDA, AMPA and GABAA receptor density and spontaneous spreading depression. This effect can be abolished by GLT-1 inhibition, indicating that upregulation of GLT-1 is an important mechanism for neuroprotective action in penumbra-like conditions, e.g. if neurosurgeons plan to occlude cerebral veins during tumor surgery.

AB  - Abstract
Interleukin-33 (IL-33), a member of the IL-1 family, has attracted growing interest since its discovery in 2003. IL-33 has been implicated in many diseases, including arthritis, asthma, allergies, and cardiovascular and infectious diseases. However, few studies have investigated its role in the transmission and modulation of pain. The present study was designed to explore the possible roles of IL-33 and its receptor, ST2, in formalin-induced inflammatory pain in mice. We found that both subcutaneous (s.c., 300 ng) and intrathecal injection (i.t., 3 ng) of recombinant IL-33 (rIL-33) increased paw lifting and licking time not only in normal mice but also in formalin models. Administration of ST2 antibody, which blocked the IL-33/ST2 signaling, alleviated the formalin-induced spontaneous pain behavior. Moreover, the ST2−/− mice showed significantly decreased pain behavior, as well as reduced ultrasonic vocalization induced by formalin, compared with the wild-type group. Additionally, ST2 antibody alleviated the potentiating effects of rIL-33 on pain behavior in the formalin mice, indicating that IL-33 plays a role in pain modulation through its ST2 receptor. These data suggest IL-33 and its ST2 receptor mediate formalin-induced inflammatory pain, and as a result this cytokine and its receptor may be new targets for the development of analgesics.

AB  - Abstract
Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder characterized by self-imposed severe starvation and often linked with excessive exercise. Activity-based anorexia (ABA) is an animal model that reproduces some of the behavioral phenotypes of AN, including the paradoxical increase in voluntary exercise following food restriction (FR). Although certain rodents have been used successfully in this animal model, C57BL/6 mice are reported to be less susceptible to ABA. We re-examined the possibility that female C57BL/6 mice might exhibit ABA vulnerability during adolescence, the developmental stage/sex among the human population with particularly high AN vulnerability. After introducing the running wheel to the cage for 3 days, ABA was induced by restricting food access to 1 h per day (ABA1, N = 13) or 2 h per day (ABA2, N = 10). All 23 exhibited increased voluntary wheel running (p &lt; 0.005) and perturbed circadian rhythm within 2 days. Only one out of five survived ABA1 for 3 days, while 10 out of 10 survived ABA2 for 3 days and could subsequently restore their body weight and circadian rhythm. Exposure of recovered animals to a second ABA2 induction revealed a large range of vulnerability, even within littermates. To look for the cellular substrate of differences in vulnerability, we began by examining synaptic patterns in the hippocampus, a brain region that regulates anxiety as well as plasticity throughout life. Quantitative EM analysis revealed that CA1 pyramidal cells of animals vulnerable to the second ABA2 exhibit less GABAergic innervation on cell bodies and dendrites, relative to the animals resilient to the second ABA (p &lt; 0.001) or controls (p &lt; 0.05). These findings reveal that C57BL/6J adolescent females can be used to capture brain changes underlying ABA vulnerability, and that GABAergic innervation of hippocampal pyramidal neurons is one important cellular substrate to consider for understanding the progression of and resilience to AN.

AB  - Precise mechanisms are required to coordinate the locomotor activity of fore- and hind-limbs in quadrupeds and similar mechanisms persist to coordinate movement of arms and legs in humans. Propriospinal neurons (PSNs) are major components of the networks that coordinate these mechanisms. The b subunit of cholera toxin (CTb) was injected unilaterally into either L1 or L3 segments in order to label ascending and descending propriospinal pathways. Labelled cells were examined with light or confocal microscopy. Cells projecting to lumbar segments were evenly distributed, bilaterally throughout all cervical segments. However many more cells were labelled from L1 injections than L3 injections. Roughly 15% of cells in both sides of the C2 segment was found to be immunoreactive for calretinin and a small number (4%) was immunoreactive for calbindin. Axons projecting from L1 to cervical segments formed predominant ipsilateral projections to the cervical intermediate grey matter and ventral horn. Very large numbers of terminals were concentrated within the ventrolateral motor (VLM) nuclei of C7–8 segments but there was sparse innervation of the contralateral nucleus. The vast majority (85%) of these axon terminals in the ipsilateral VML was immunoreactive for the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) and the remaining 15% was immunoreactive for the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT); many of these contained GABA and/or glycine. Inhibitory and excitatory terminals were also found in the contralateral VLM. Most of the terminals in the VLM made contacts with motoneurons. The major finding of this study is the existence of a substantial excitatory propriospinal pathway that projects specifically to the VLM. Motoneurons in the VLM supply muscles of the axilla therefore this pathway is likely to have a profound influence on the activity of the shoulder joint. This pathway may synchronise lumbar and cervical pattern generators and hence the coordination of locomotor activity in the fore- and hind limbs.

AB  - Animal models are vital tools to study the genetic, molecular, cellular, and environmental parameters involved in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Over the years, these models have expanded our understanding of the pathogenesis of many neuropsychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Although animal models have been widely used in psychiatry, and despite several years of extensive research with these models, their validity is still being investigated and presents a challenge to both investigators and clinicians as well. In this concise review, we will describe the most common animal models utilized in neuropsychiatry, including animal models of depression, anxiety, and psychosis. In addition, we will also discuss the validity and reliability of these models and current challenges in this domain. Furthermore, this work will discuss the role of gene–environment interaction as an additional contributing factor that modulates neuropsychological outcome and its implication on animal models. This overview will give a succinct summary of animal models in psychiatry which will be useful both to the seasoned researcher, as well as novices in the field.

AB  - Alterations in axon–dendrite polarity impair functional recovery in the developing CNS after hypoxia–ischemia (HI) injury. PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) signaling pathway mediates the formation of neuronal polarity. However, its role in cerebral HI injury is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the role of PTEN pathway in regulation of axon–dendrite polarity using an oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) model with rat cortical neurons. We found that the activity of PTEN and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) was increased after OGD, along with the decrease of the activity in protein kinase B (Akt) and collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2). Pretreatment with bpv, a potent inhibitor of PTEN, caused a decrease of the activity in PTEN and GSK-3β, and a significant increase of the activity in Akt and CRMP-2. Simultaneously, the morphological polarity of neurons was maintained and neuronal apoptosis was reduced. Moreover, inhibition of PTEN rescued vesicle recycling in axons. These findings suggested that the PTEN/Akt/GSK-3β/CRMP-2 pathway is involved in the regulation of axon-dendrite polarity, providing a novel route for protecting neurons following neonatal HI.

AB  - Patients with schizophrenia exhibit deficits in motivation and affect, which suggests an impairment in the reward system. The psychotomimetic drug, phencyclidine (PCP), also induces schizophrenia-like negative symptoms, such as reduced motivation, blunted affect, and social withdrawal in both humans and animals. Previous studies have indicated that the dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play a pivotal role in the development of reward-associated learning and motivation. However, how PCP affects the activity of VTA neurons during performance of a reward-related task and social interaction with others in unanesthetized animals remains unclear. Here, we recorded the unit activity of VTA neurons in freely moving rats before and after systemic administration of PCP in a classical conditioning paradigm, and during social interaction with an unfamiliar partner. In the classical conditioning task, two different tones were sequentially presented, one of which accompanied electrical stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle as an unconditioned stimulus. After identifying the response properties of recorded neurons in the classical conditioning task and social interaction, animals received an intraperitoneal injection of PCP.

Our study demonstrated that most VTA neurons responsive to reward-associated stimuli were also activated during social interaction. Such activation of neurons was considerably suppressed by systemic administration of PCP, thus, PCP may affect the firing activity of VTA neurons that are involved in motivation, learning, and social interaction. Disruption of the response of VTA neurons to reward stimuli and socially interactive situations may be involved in PCP-induced impairments similar to the negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

AB  - The mouse Dach1 gene, involved in the development of the neocortex and the hippocampus, is expressed by neural stem cells (NSCs) during early neurogenesis, and its expression also continues in a subpopulation of cells in the dorsal part of the lateral ventricles (LV) of the adult mouse brain. In this study we aimed to elucidate the role of Dach1-expressing cells in adult neurogenesis/gliogenesis under physiological as well as post-ischemic conditions, employing transgenic mice in which the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) is controlled by the D6 promotor of the mouse Dach1 gene. A neurosphere-forming assay of GFP+ cells isolated from the dorsal part of the LV was carried out with subsequent differentiation in vitro. To elucidate the neurogenic/gliogenic potential of GFP+ cells in the dorsal part of the LV, in situ immunohistochemical/electrophysiological analyses of GFP+ cells in adult sham-operated brains (controls) and those after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) were performed. The GFP+ cells isolated from the dorsal part of the LV of controls formed neurospheres and differentiated solely into a glial phenotype, while those isolated after MCAo also gave rise to cells with the properties of neuronal precursors. In situ analyses revealed that GFP+ cells express the phenotype of adult NSCs or neuroblasts in controls as well as following ischemia. Following MCAo we found a significantly increased number of GFP+ cells expressing doublecortin as well as a number of GFP+ cells migrating through the rostral migratory stream into the olfactory bulb, where they probably differentiated into calretinin+ interneurons. Collectively, our results suggest the involvement of the mouse Dach1 gene in adult neurogenesis; cells expressing this gene exhibit the properties of adult NSCs or neuroblasts and respond to MCAo by enhanced neurogenesis.

AB  - Abstract
The medullary raphé (MR) of the medulla oblongata contains chemosensitive neurons that respond to increases in arterial [CO2], by altering firing rate, with increases being associated with serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine [5HT]) neurons and decreases, with GABAergic neurons. Both types of neurons contribute to increased alveolar ventilation. Decreases in intracellular pH are thought to link the rise in [CO2] to increased ventilation. Because electroneutral Na+-coupled HCO 3 - transporters (nNCBTs), which help protect cells from intracellular acidosis, are expressed robustly in the neurons of the central nervous system, a key question is whether these transporters are present in chemosensitive neurons. Therefore, we used an immunocytochemistry approach to identify neurons (using a microtubule associated protein-2 monoclonal antibody) and specifically 5HT neurons (TPH monoclonal antibody) or GABAergic neurons (GAD2 monoclonal antibody) in freshly dissociated cells from the mouse MR. We also co-labeled with polyclonal antibodies against the three nNCBTs: NBCn1, NDCBE, and NBCn2. We exploited ePet-EYFP (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein) mice (with EYFP-labeled 5HT neurons) as well as mice genetically deficient in each of the three nNCBTs. Quantitative image analysis distinguished positively stained cells from background signals. We found that &gt;80% of GAD2+ cells also were positive for NDCBE, and &gt;90% of the TPH+ and GAD2+ cells were positive for the other nNCBTs. Assuming that the transporters are independently distributed among neurons, we can conclude that virtually all chemosensitive MR neurons contain at least one nNCBT.

AB  - Abstract
Although there has been an abundance of research focused on offspring outcomes associated with maternal experiences, there has been limited examination of the relationship between paternal experiences and offspring brain development. As spermatogenesis is a continuous process, experiences that have the ability to alter epigenetic regulation in fathers may actually change developmental trajectories of offspring. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of paternal stress prior to conception on behaviour and the epigenome of both male and female developing rat offspring. Male Long-Evans rats were stressed for 27 consecutive days and then mated with control female rats. Early behaviour was tested in offspring using the negative geotaxis task and the open field. At P21 offspring were sacrificed and global DNA methylation levels in the hippocampus and frontal cortex were analysed. Paternal stress prior to conception altered behaviour of all offspring on the negative geotaxis task, delaying acquisition of the task. In addition, male offspring demonstrated a reduction in stress reactivity in the open field paradigm spending more time than expected in the centre of the open field. Paternal stress also altered DNA methylation patterns in offspring at P21, global methylation was reduced in the frontal cortex of female offspring, but increased in the hippocampus of both male and female offspring. The results from this study clearly demonstrate that paternal stress during spermatogenesis can influence offspring behaviour and DNA methylation patterns, and these affects occur in a sex-dependent manner. Development takes place in the centre of a complex interaction between maternal, paternal, and environmental influences, which combine to produce the various phenotypes and individual differences that we perceive.

AB  - Irisin is a recently identified myokine secreted from the muscle in response to exercise. In the rats and mice, immunohistochemical studies with an antiserum against irisin peptide fragment (42–112), revealed that irisin-immunoreactivity (irIRN) was detected in three types of cells; namely, skeletal muscle cells, cardiomyocytes, and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Tissue sections processed with irisin antiserum pre-absorbed with the irisin peptide (42–112) (1 μg/ml) showed no immunoreactivity. Cerebellar Purkinje cells were also immunolabeled with an antiserum against fibronectin type II domain containing 5 (FNDC5), the precursor protein of irisin. Double-labeling of cerebellar sections with irisin antiserum and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) antibody showed that nearly all irIRN Purkinje cells were GAD-positive. Injection of the fluorescence tracer Fluorogold into the vestibular nucleus of the rat medulla retrogradely labeled a population of Purkinje cells, some of which were also irIRN. Our results provide the first evidence of expression of irIRN in the rodent skeletal and cardiac muscle, and in the brain where it is present in GAD-positive Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. Our findings together with reports by others led us to hypothesize a novel neural pathway, which originates from cerebellum Purkinje cells, via several intermediary synapses in the medulla and spinal cord, and regulates adipocyte metabolism.

AB  - Abstract
Parallel representations of the visual world are already established at the very first synapse of the visual system. Cone photoreceptors, which hyperpolarize in response to light, forward the visual signal onto distinct types of ON and OFF cone bipolar cells (BCs). In the case of OFF BCs, the glutamatergic cone input is integrated by ionotropic glutamate receptors, giving rise to a sign-preserving mode of synaptic transmission. The combination of glutamate receptor (GluR) subunits, i.e. AMPA or kainate subunits, importantly contributes to shaping the OFF bipolar cells’ distinct response properties. The mouse is one of the few mammals in which the (most likely) complete set of (five) retinal OFF BC types is identified. However, it is not clear which GluR subtypes are expressed by the different mouse OFF BC types. We addressed this question by combining immunolabeling, electrical whole-cell recordings and pharmacology, and present evidence that the different types of OFF BCs express distinct types of glutamate receptors: Type 1 BCs exclusively expressed AMPA receptors, whereas type 2 and type 3a BCs expressed kainate receptors of different subunit compositions. Additionally, we found that two OFF BC types (3b and 4) very likely express both AMPA and kainate receptors but, interestingly, the two receptor subunits were not co-localized at the same dendritic site. The complex, BC type-specific expression pattern of GluRs we describe here supports their essential role in establishing parallel pathways at the first synapse of the mouse visual system.

AB  - Abstract
Deceit is a core feature of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), and the study of deception in ASPD has important implications for identifying the underlying mechanism of ASPD. A great deal of functional neuroimaging literature has described the neural correlates of deception in healthy volunteers, but there have been few imaging studies examining people with ASPD. The neural correlates of lie-telling in ASPD, and which specific brain activities are related to the capacity to lie, are unclear. In this study, 32 offenders who satisfied the Personality Diagnostic Questionaire-4 and PDI-IV (Personality Disorder Interview) criteria for ASPD were divided into three groups based on their capacity for deception, which was evaluated based on the deceitfulness criterion of the PDI-IV ASPD. All offenders underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while responding to questions in a truthful, inverse, or deceitful manner. We primarily created contrasts in the brain activities between truth-telling and lie-telling, and then computed the Pearson’s correlation coefficients between activities contrasts of individual, i.e. BOLD (blood-oxygen-level-dependent) strength during deception minus that during truth-telling, and the capacity for deception. Our results indicated that the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex extending to the middle frontal gyrus, the left inferior parietal lobule, and the bilateral anterior cingulate gyrus/medial superior frontal gyrus were associated with deception among people with ASPD. As the capacity for deception increased, the contrasted brain activities of the above regions decreased. This study found that truthful and untruthful communications of ASPD subjects can be differentiated in terms of brain BOLD activities, and more importantly, this study is the first to use fMRI to discover that BOLD activities during deception are correlated with the capacity to lie. The latter finding might challenge the diagnostic accuracy of lie detection and may also caution that greater attention should be given to detecting untruths in individuals who are skilled at lying.

AB  - Abstract
The basolateral amygdala (BLA) and infralimbic (IL) cortex share strong reciprocal interconnections and are key structures in conditioned fear circuitry. Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) or its receptor antagonists can modulate the conditioned fear response when exogenously administered at either of these sites, and increased release of GRP at the BLA occurs in response to conditioned fear recall. The present study sought to determine whether a functional pathway utilizing GRP exists between the IL cortex and BLA and whether this pathway is also influenced by amygdala corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) release. To this end, we assessed the effects of intra-IL cortex injection of GRP or GRP co-administered with a receptor antagonist, RC-3095, on the downstream release of GRP and/or CRF at the BLA. Results showed that microinjection of GRP at the IL cortex increased the release of GRP, but not CRF, at the BLA, an effect blocked by co-administration of RC-3095. Administration of RC-3095 into the IL cortex on its own, however, also elicited the release of GRP (but not CRF) at the BLA. These findings suggest that a functional pathway utilizing GRP (among other factors) exists between the IL cortex and BLA that may be relevant to conditioned fear, but that GRP and CRF do not interact within this circuitry. Moreover, the finding that the release profile of GRP was similar following administration of either GRP or its receptor antagonist, lends support to the view that RC-3095 has partial agonist properties. Together these findings provide further evidence for the involvement of GRP in fear and anxiety-related disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Characterization of the brain’s vascular system is of major clinical importance in the assessment of patients with cerebrovascular disease. The aim of this study was to characterize brain hemodynamics using multiparametric methods and to obtain reference values from the healthy brain. A multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study was performed in twenty healthy subjects, including dynamic susceptibility contrast imaging and blood oxygen level dependence (BOLD) during hypercapnia and carbogen challenges. Brain tissues were defined using unsupervised cluster analysis based on these three methods, and several hemodynamic parameters were calculated for gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), blood vessels and dura (BVD); the three main vascular territories within the GM; and arteries and veins defined within the BVD cluster.

The carbogen challenge produced a BOLD signal twice as high as the hypercapnia challenge, in all brain tissues. The three brain tissues differed significantly from each other in their hemodynamic characteristics, supporting the graded vascularity of the tissues, with BVD &gt; GM &gt; WM. Within the GM cluster, a significant delay of ∼1.2 s of the bolus arrival time was detected within the posterior cerebral artery territory relative to the middle and anterior cerebral artery territories. No differences were detected between right and left middle cerebral artery territories for all hemodynamic parameters. Within the BVD cluster, a significant delay of ∼1.9 s of the bolus arrival time was detected within the veins relative to the arteries. This parameter enabled to differentiate between the various blood vessels, including arteries, veins and choroid plexus. This study provides reference values for several hemodynamic parameters, obtained from healthy brains, and may be clinically important in the assessment of patients with various vascular pathologies.

AB  - Abstract
Memories of learned associations between the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse and environmental cues contribute to craving and relapse in humans. Disruption of reconsolidation dampens or even erases previous memories. Dopamine (DA) mediates the acquisition of reward memory and drugs of abuse can pathologically change related neuronal circuits in the mesolimbic DA system. Previous studies showed that DA D3 receptors are involved in cocaine-conditioned place preference (CPP) and reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior. However, the role of D3 receptors in reconsolidation of cocaine-induced reward memory remains unclear. In the present study, we combined genetic and pharmacological approaches to investigate the role of D3 receptors in reconsolidation of cocaine-induced CPP. We found that the mutation of the D3 receptor gene weakened reconsolidation of cocaine-induced CPP in mice triggered by a 3-min (min) retrieval. Furthermore, treatment of a selective D3 receptor antagonist PG01037 immediately following the 3-min retrieval disrupted reconsolidation of cocaine-induced CPP in wild-type mice and such disruption remained at least 1 week after the 3-min retrieval. These results suggest that D3 receptors play a key role in reconsolidation of cocaine-induced CPP in mice, and that pharmacological blockade of these receptors may be therapeutic for the treatment of cocaine craving and relapse in clinical settings.

AB  - Abstract
Autophagy may contribute to ischemia-induced cell death in the brain, but the regulation of autophagic cell death is largely unknown. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is a regulator of apoptosis in cerebral ischemia. We examined the hypothesis that autophagy-like cell death could contribute to ischemia-induced brain damage and the process was regulated by NF-κB. In adult wild-type (WT) and NF-κB p50 knockout (p50−/−) mice, focal ischemia in the barrel cortex was induced by ligation of distal branches of the middle cerebral artery. Twelve to 24 h later, autophagic activity increased as indicated by enhanced expression of Beclin-1 and LC3 in the ischemic core and/or penumbra regions. This increased autophagy contributed to cell injury, evidenced by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) co-staining and a protective effect achieved by the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine. The number of Beclin-1/TUNEL-positive cells was significantly more in p50−/− mice than in WT mice. Neuronal and vascular cell death, as determined by TUNEL-positive cells co-staining with NeuN or Collagen IV, was more abundant in p50−/− mice. Immunostaining of the endothelial cell tight junction marker occludin revealed more damage to the blood–brain barrier in p50−/− mice. Western blotting of the peri-infarct tissue showed a reduction of Akt-the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in p50−/− mice after ischemia. These findings provide the first evidence that cerebral ischemia induced autophagy-like injury is regulated by the NF-κB pathway, which may suggest potential treatments for ischemic stroke.

AB  - Abstract
Hemeoxygenase (HO) is an enzymatic system that degrades heme. HO-1 is an inducible isoform whereas HO-2 is constitutive. Stroke strongly induces HO-1 expression but the underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Cytokines that are up-regulated after ischemia, like interleukin (IL)-10, can induce HO-1 gene expression, which is positively regulated by the transcriptional activator nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and negatively regulated by the transcriptional repressor breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) associated C-terminal helicase 1 (Bach-1). While Nrf2 is activated after ischemia and drugs promoting Nrf2 activation increase HO-1 and are beneficial, the involvement of Bach-1 is unknown. Here we investigated mechanisms involved in HO-1 induction and evaluated the effects of HO activity inhibition in mouse permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). HO-1 was induced after ischemia in IL-10-deficient mice suggesting that post-ischemic HO-1 induction was IL-10-independent. Attenuation of Bach-1 gene repression after ischemia was associated to enhanced HO-1 induction. Administration of the HO activity inhibitor zinc proto-porphyrin IX (ZnPP) i.p. 24 h before pMCAO exacerbated ischemia-induced tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and IL-1β, nitro-oxidative stress, and the presence of neutrophils at 8 h, and increased infarct volume at day 4. However, ZnPP did not worsen ischemic damage when given 30 min before pMCAO. ZnPP induced HO-1 expression in the cerebral vasculature at 24 h, when it was still detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in plasma. While ZnPP was not found in brain tissue extracts of controls, it could be detected after ischemia, supporting that a small fraction of the injected drug can reach the tissue following blood–brain barrier breakdown. The deleterious effect of inhibiting HO activity in ischemia became apparent in the presence of ZnPP-induced HO-1, which is known to exert effects independent of its enzymatic activity. In conclusion, HO-1 induction after ischemia was associated to down-regulation of transcriptional repressor Bach-1, and induction of HO-1 when HO enzymatic activity was inhibited was related to worst outcome after brain ischemia.

AB  - Abstract
Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with polyglutamine (polyQ) protein ataxin-3. Ataxin-3 is a multi-functional protein, but the precise mechanisms underlying the cellular functions of ataxin-3 remain to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate that ataxin-3 plays a protective role against cellular oxidative stress induced by H2O2 in a Bcl-XL-dependent manner. Ataxin-3 directly interacts with Bcl-XL. The N-terminus of ataxin-3 and the C-terminus of Bcl-XL are essential for the interaction. Ataxin-3 promotes the interaction between Bcl-XL and Bax, but does not affect the ubiquitination and degradation of Bcl-XL. Our data suggest that ataxin-3 plays an important role in regulating the Bcl-XL–Bax-mediated anti-oxidative response by modulating the interaction between Bcl-XL and Bax.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic stress or glucocorticoid exposure simplifies hippocampal Cornu Ammonis region 3 (CA3) apical dendritic arbors in male rats. In contrast to males, chronic stress either reduces CA3 basal branching or exerts no observable morphological effects in gonadally intact female rats. Under conditions that females display stress-induced CA3 dendritic retraction, such as that following ovariectomy, chronic exposure to 17β-estradiol or cholesterol can negate these changes. Whether glucocorticoids produce CA3 dendritic retraction in ovariectomized females and whether neuroprotection from 17β-estradiol or cholesterol is sex-specific remains unknown. The current study examined the effects of chronic glucocorticoid exposure, in conjunction with 17β-estradiol or cholesterol administration, on hippocampal CA3 dendritic complexity. Adult male and female Sprague–Dawley rats were gonadectomized and implanted with 25% 17β-estradiol in cholesterol, 100% cholesterol, or blank Silastic capsules. Rats were then assigned to either a 21-day corticosterone (CORT) drink (400 μg/ml CORT, 2.4% ethanol in tap water) or tap water (Tap, 2.4% ethanol in tap water) treatment. Brains were processed for Golgi staining, and hippocampal CA3 dendritic architecture was quantified. Results showed 21-day CORT administration reduced hippocampal CA3 apical dendritic branch points, CA3 apical dendritic length, body weight gain, and adrenal weights compared to male and female control counterparts. Furthermore, male and female rats implanted with Silastic capsules containing cholesterol or 25% 17β-estradiol in cholesterol were protected from CORT-induced CA3 apical dendritic branch reduction. No effects were observed in the CA3 basal dendritic arbors. The present results demonstrate that CORT produces hippocampal CA3 dendritic retraction in gonadectomized male and female rats and that cholesterol and 25% 17β-estradiol in cholesterol prevent this dendritic simplification.

In the present study, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) was delivered intrathecally to the injured spinal segments immediately after root avulsion in rats to knock down expression of the c-jun gene in injured spinal motoneurons so as to explore the role of c-jun in the motoneurons in vivo. Our results showed that the siRNA not only inhibited the expression of both c-jun mRNA and protein but also augmented the death of injured motoneurons at day 14 post-injury. These findings indicated that induction of c-jun gene expression plays a pivotal role in the survival of injured motoneurons. Meanwhile, these results suggest that siRNAs applied intrathecally can effectively mediate the expression of the c-jun gene in injured motoneurons.

AB  - Abstract
Adolescence is a developmental period when many teenagers first drink alcohol and often engage in binge drinking. Early onset of alcohol is linked to increased risk of stress-related disorders in adulthood in humans, suggesting that alcohol may interfere with development of the stress regulatory system. We investigated the effect of voluntary alcohol exposure on corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) peptide-producing cells in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) in adolescent male and female rats. These cells are important for the autonomic and behavioral responses to stress, have been implicated in addiction, and change over adolescent development. Animals self-administered sweetened alcohol during early adolescence (postnatal days (PDs) 28–42) and brains were obtained on PD 43 for CRF peptide immunolabeling. Females had fewer CRF immunoreactive (-ir) cells in the CeA compared to males. In both males and females, alcohol self-administration reduced the number of CRF-ir cells in the CeA compared to control conditions in which rats self-administered equivalent levels of sweetened water that did not contain alcohol. Reduced peptide labeling was not observed in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, indicating regional specificity of these changes. Alterations within the CRF cell population of the amygdala may have important implications for susceptibility to alcohol and stress disorders during adolescence and later on in life.

AB  - Abstract
Lipid rafts are the preferential site of numerous membrane signaling proteins which are involved in neuronal functioning and survival. These proteins are organized in multiprotein complexes, or signalosomes, in close contact with lipid classes particularly represented in lipid rafts (i.e. cholesterol, sphingolipids and saturated fatty acids), which may contribute to physiological responses leading to neuroprotection. Increasing evidence indicates that alteration of lipid composition in raft structures as a consequence of neuropathologies, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), causes a dramatic increase in lipid raft order. These phenomena may correlate with perturbation of signalosome activities, likely contributing to neurodegenerative progression. Interestingly, significant disruption of stable raft microenvironments has been already observed in the first stages of either AD or PD, suggesting that these alterations may represent early events in the neuropathological development. In this regard, the search for biochemical markers, such as specific metabolic products altered in the brain at the first steps of the disease, presently represents an important challenge for early diagnostic strategies. Alterations of these biomarkers may be reflected in either plasma or cerebrospinal fluid, thus representing a potential strategy to predict an accurate diagnosis. We propose that pathologically-linked lipid raft markers may be interesting candidates to be explored at this level, although it has not been studied so far to what extent alteration of different signalosome components may be reflected in peripheral fluids. In this mini-review, we will discuss on relevant aspects of lipid rafts that contribute to the modulation of neuropathological events related to AD and PD. An interesting hypothesis is that anomalies on raft biomarkers measured at peripheral fluids might mirror the lipid raft pathology observed in early stages of AD and PD.

AB  - Abstract
Besides its prominent role in angiogenesis, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) also exerts important protective effects on neurons. In particular, mice expressing reduced levels of VEGF suffer from late-onset motor neuron degeneration, whereas VEGF delivery significantly delays motor neuron death in ALS mouse models, at least partly through neuroprotective effects. Additionally, VEGF protects dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons against paclitaxel-induced neurotoxicity. Here, we demonstrate that VEGF also protects DRG neurons against hyperglycemia-induced neuronal stress as a model of diabetes-induced peripheral neuropathy. Specifically, VEGF decreased expression of the stress-related gene activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) in DRG neurons isolated from streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice (ex vivo) and in isolated DRG neurons exposed to high glucose concentrations (in vitro). In vivo, local VEGF application also protected against paclitaxel- and diabetes-induced neuropathies without causing side effects. A small synthetic VEGF mimicking pentadecapeptide (QK) exerted similar effects on DRG cultures: the peptide reduced ATF3 expression in vitro and ex vivo in paclitaxel- and hyperglycemia-induced models of neuropathy to a similar extent as the full-length recombinant VEGF protein. By using transgenic mice selectively overexpressing the VEGF receptor 2 in postnatal neurons, these neuroprotective effects were shown to be mediated through VEGF receptor 2. Overall, these results underscore the potential of VEGF and VEGF-derived peptides for the treatment of peripheral neuropathies.

AB  - Abstract
Brain iron accumulation and oxidative stress are common features of many neurodegenerative diseases, and could be due in part to increased iron influx across the blood–brain interface. The iron transport protein, divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) is found in reactive astrocytes of the lesioned hippocampal CA fields after excitotoxicity induced by the glutamate analog kainate (KA), but in order for iron to be transported by DMT1, it must be converted from the ferric to the ferrous form. The present study was carried out to investigate the expression of a ferric reductase, duodenal cytochrome b (DCYTB), in the rat hippocampus after KA injury. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed significant increases in DCYTB mRNA expression of 2.5, 2.7, and 5.2-fold in the hippocampus at 1 week, 2 weeks and 1 month post-KA lesions respectively compared to untreated controls, and 3.0-fold compared to 1 month post-saline injection. DCYTB-positive cells were double labeled with glial fibrillary acidic protein, and electron microscopy showed that the DCYTB-positive cells had dense bundles of glial filaments, characteristic of astrocytes, and were present as end-feet around unlabeled brain capillary endothelial cells. DMT1 labeling in astrocytes and increased iron staining were also observed in the lesioned hippocampus. Together, the present findings of DCYTB and DMT1 localization in astrocytes suggest that DCYTB is a ferric reductase for reduction of ferric iron, for transport by DMT1 into the brain. We postulate that the coordinated action of these two proteins could be important in iron influx across the blood–brain interface, in areas undergoing neurodegeneration.

AB  - Abstract
Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN DBS) provides a unique window into human brain function since it can reversibly alter the functioning of specific brain circuits. Basal ganglia–cortical circuits are thought to be excessively noisy in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD), based in part on the lack of specificity of proprioceptive signals in basal ganglia–thalamic–cortical circuits in monkey models of the disease. PD patients are known to have deficits in proprioception, but the effects are often subtle, with paradigms typically restricted to one or two joint movements in a plane. Moreover, the effects of STN DBS on proprioception are virtually unexplored. We tested the following hypotheses: first, that PD patients will show substantial deficits in unconstrained, multi-joint proprioception, and, second, that STN DBS will improve multi-joint proprioception. Twelve PD patients with bilaterally implanted electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus and 12 age-matched healthy subjects were asked to position the left hand at a location that was proprioceptively defined in 3D space with the right hand. In a second condition, subjects were provided visual feedback during the task so that they were not forced to rely on proprioception. Overall, with STN DBS switched off, PD patients showed significantly larger proprioceptive localization errors, and greater variability in endpoint localizations than the control subjects. Visual feedback partially normalized PD performance, and demonstrated that the errors in proprioceptive localization were not simply due to a difficulty in executing the movements or in remembering target locations. Switching STN DBS on significantly reduced localization errors from those of control subjects when patients moved without visual feedback relative to when they moved with visual feedback (when proprioception was not required). However, this reduction in localization errors without vision came at the cost of increased localization variability.

AB  - Abstract
Plasticity resulting from early sensory deprivation has been investigated in both animals and humans. After sensory deprivation, brain areas that are normally associated with the lost sense are recruited to carry out functions in the remaining intact modalities. Previous studies have reported that it is almost exclusively the visual dorsal pathway which is affected by auditory deprivation. The purpose of the current study was to further investigate the possible reorganization of visual ventral stream functions in deaf individuals in both the auditory and the visual cortices. Fifteen pre-lingual profoundly deaf subjects were compared with a group of 16 hearing subjects. We used fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) to explore the areas underlying the processing of two similar visual motion stimuli that however were designed to evoke different types of processing: (1) a global motion stimulus (GMS) which preferentially activates regions of the dorsal visual stream, and (2) a form-from-motion (FFM) stimulus which is known to recruit regions from both visual streams. No significant differences between deaf and hearing individuals were found in target visual and auditory areas when the motion and form components of the stimuli were isolated (contrasted with a static visual image). However, increases in activation were found in the deaf group in the superior temporal gyrus (BA 22 and 42) and in an area located at the junction of the parieto-occipital sulcus and the calcarine fissure (encompassing parts of the cuneus, precuneus and the lingual gyrus) for the GMS and FFM conditions as well as for the static image, relative to a baseline condition absent of any visual stimulation. These results suggest that the observed cross-modal recruitment of auditory areas in deaf individuals does not appear to be specialized for motion processing, but rather is present for both motion and static visual stimuli.

AB  - Abstract
Progenitor cell proliferation is ubiquitous in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone (SGZ) of adult mammalian brains, however, the abundance and distribution of proliferation are surprisingly heterogeneous between species. In rodents, proliferation is high in both the SVZ and SGZ, while in humans proliferation is prominent in the SVZ but limited in the SGZ. To accurately study proliferation and how it changes in human disease, we should focus on animals in which the patterns of proliferation are consistent with the human brain. In this study, we characterized the neurogenic niches of the adult sheep, an animal model with a longer lifespan than rodents and a highly gyrencephalic brain, using 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) as a mitotic marker and neuronal nuclear antigen to identify neuronal lineage cells. Our study demonstrates that the sheep SVZ is organized into the same distinct layers that are comparable to what has been described in humans. The rate of maturation of new neurons was slower in sheep than in previous reports in rodents, with only 20% of BrdU-positive cells showing neuronal phenotype after 4 months survival following BrdU administration. Most importantly, as in the human, there was much greater proliferation in the sheep SVZ than in the SGZ. These results suggest that the sheep is a better basis for comparisons with human SVZ and SGZ neurogenesis than rodents.

In previous work our group described the synthesis and the activity on rat cerebellum granule cell GABAA receptors of new 1,5-benzodiazepine compounds. Here we are describing the synthesis of new triazolobenzodiazepines (mainly 1,5-benzodiazepine derivatives) and the evaluation of their biological activity in terms of effects on those GABAA receptors. Their effects were compared to those of 1,4-benzodiazepine agonists and some known 1,5-benzodiazepines. The activities were evaluated for the two GABAA receptor populations present in cerebellar granule cells, one mediating phasic inhibition and the other one mediating tonic inhibition.

Some of the compounds displayed a profile of agonist at the component mediating phasic inhibition. This agonistic activity was prevented by the benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil. Interestingly, the active compounds displayed an agonistic activity at these receptors significantly greater than that of “classical” 1,4-benzodiazepine agonists, such as diazepam, flunitrazepam and alprazolam.

l-DOPA alleviates the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, but its long-term use is associated with undesirable dyskinesia. We now tested whether exercise can attenuate this l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). We tested the effects of exercise on LID in 6-hydroxydopamine hydrochloride-hemiparkinsonian mice. Animals were treated with l-DOPA/benserazide (25/12.5 mg/kg, i.p.) without and with possibility to exercise (running wheel) during 2 weeks. Exercise drastically prevented the development of LID, and its associated aberrant striatal signaling, namely the hyperphosphorylation of dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein 32 kDa protein and c-Fos expression. Our results indicate that exercise can partially prevent the development of LID through the normalization of striatopallidal dopaminergic signaling.

AB  - Abstract
We tested the hypothesis that impaired force steadiness early after stroke is associated with changes in frequency composition of the force signal during constant-force task. The power spectra and the relationship between power spectra and force variability during isometric knee extension (10%, 20%, 30%, and 50% of peak torque for 10 s) were studied in the paretic and non-paretic legs of 34 stroke patients (64 ± 14 years, 8–25 days post-injury) and the dominant leg of 20 controls (62 ± 10 years). Power spectrum analysis of the force signal included the median frequency, peak power frequency, relative peak power, and relative power in 0–3, 4–6, and 8–12 Hz bands. Force variability, quantified by coefficient of variation (CV), was increased in patients at 3 of the 4 contraction levels (P ⩽ 0.001). Median frequency across all force levels was decreased and the relative peak power was increased in the paretic and non-paretic legs compared to controls (P ⩽ 0.001). The relative power was increased in 0–3 Hz band and decreased in both 4–6 and 8–12 Hz bands in the paretic leg only (P ⩽ 0.001). Progressively stronger contractions brought about a significant decrease in relative power in the 0–3 Hz band and increase in 8–12 Hz band in controls but not in stroke subjects. The hypothesis was confirmed by significant non-linear correlations between CV and each relative spectral power found in the paretic leg at most contraction levels (0.22 ⩽ R2 ⩽ 0.72, P ⩽ 0.0004) and in the non-paretic leg at 10% only (0.35 ⩽ R2 ⩽ 0.52, P ⩽ 0.0002), but not in controls. Fugl-Meyer lower extremity motor and sensory scores were not related to the frequency measures in stroke subjects (P &gt; 0.05). Limited modulation of frequency spectra and the emergence of non-linear relation between power spectra and force variability suggest that less broadband force output may account in part for impaired force steadiness in paretic and non-paretic legs early after stroke.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic alcohol intake is known to induce the selective neuronal damage associated with increase oxidative–nitrosative stress and activation of inflammatory cascade finally resulting in cognitive deficits. In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of curcumin, a potent natural anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory molecule against chronic alcohol-induced cognitive dysfunction and nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-κβ) mediated inflammatory signaling in the brain of rats chronically administered ethanol. Male Wistar rats were given ethanol (10 g/kg; oral gavage) for 10 weeks, and treated with curcumin (15, 30 and 60 mg/kg) for the same duration. Ethanol-exposed rats showed impaired spatial navigation in the Morris water maze test and poor retention in the elevated plus maze task which was coupled with enhanced acetylcholinesterase activity, increased oxidative–nitrosative stress, cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1β)), NF-kβ and caspase-3 levels in different brain regions (cerebral cortex and hippocampus) of ethanol-treated rats. Co-administration with curcumin significantly and dose-dependently prevented all the behavioral, biochemical and molecular alterations in rats chronically administered ethanol. Thus, findings from the current study demonstrates the possible involvement of oxidative–nitrosative stress mediated cytokine release and inflammatory signaling in chronic alcohol-induced cognitive dysfunction and also suggests the effectiveness of curcumin in preventing cognitive deficits associated with chronic alcohol consumption.

AB  - Abstract
The present study examined whether nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) of the CA1 regions of the dorsal hippocampus and medial septum (MS) are involved in cross state-dependent memory retrieval between WIN55, 212-2 (WIN, a non-selective CB1/CB2 receptor agonist) and nicotine or ethanol. Memory retrieval was measured in one-trial step-down type passive avoidance apparatus in male adult mice. Pre-training intraperitoneal administration of WIN (0.1–1 mg/kg) dose-dependently impaired memory retrieval when it was tested 24 h later. Pre-test systemic administration of nicotine (0.6 and 0.7 mg/kg, s.c.) or ethanol (0.5 g/kg, i.p.) improved WIN-induced memory impairment, suggesting a cross state-dependent memory retrieval between the drugs. Pre-test intra-CA1 microinjection of nicotine (1 and 2 μg/mouse) before systemic administration of an ineffective dose of nicotine (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) or ethanol (0.25 g/kg) significantly reversed WIN-induced memory impairment. Pre-test intra-CA1 microinjection of mecamylamine (1 and 3 μg/mouse) inhibited cross state-dependent memory between WIN and nicotine or ethanol. Moreover, pre-test intra-MS microinjection of nicotine (1 and 2 μg/mouse) in combination with systemic administration of a lower dose of nicotine (0.5 mg/kg), but not ethanol (0.25 g/kg), improved memory impairment induced by pre-training administration of WIN. On the other hand, in the animals that received pre-training WIN and pre-test systemic administration of nicotine (0.7 mg/kg), but not ethanol (0.5 g/kg), pre-test intra-MS microinjection of mecamylamine (1–5 μg/mouse) inhibited WIN-nicotine state-dependent memory retrieval. It should be noted that pre-test intra-CA1 or intra-MS microinjection of nicotine or mecamylamine by itself had no effect on memory retrieval and also could not reverse memory impairment induced by pre-training administration of WIN. It can be concluded that WIN and nicotine or WIN and ethanol can induce state-dependent memory retrieval. In addition, our results showed that a cross-state dependency between these drugs may be mediated through a cholinergic nicotinic mechanism.

AB  - Abstract
It is widely known that prenatal stress (PS) exposure causes depression-like behaviour to offspring, as well as maladaptive responses including neurobiological and physiological changes. However, the underlying mechanism of PS induced juvenile-onset depression remains largely unravelled. The inadequacies of monoamine deficiency hypothesis, the emerging evidence of altered glutamate neurotransmission in mood disorders, as well as our previous studies inspired us to assess the potential role of glutamatergic system in the pathogenesis of juvenile depression. In this research, we examined the expression of phosphorylated GluR1 subunit of ionotropic receptor alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR), the Na+-dependent glutamate transporters excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) and EAAT3 in the hippocampus, striatum and frontal cortex of 1-month-old rat offspring after mid and late PS exposure. Prenatally stressed offspring rats showed significantly prolonged duration of immobility and shortened immobility latency in tail suspension test. We also detected that PS significantly altered the expression of glutamate receptor and glutamate transporters of these depressed rats. In brief, the changes of phosphorylated GluR1 subunit of AMPAR protein level in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, as well as markedly decreased EAAT2 mRNA expression in the hippocampus, striatum and frontal cortex and EAAT3 mRNA expression in the hippocampus of stressed rats were both observed. These results underpinned that glutamate receptors and glutamate transporters might be involved in the progress of depression-like behaviour in juvenile rat offspring induced by PS.

AB  - Abstract
Ethyl pyruvate (EP) is a pyruvate derivative and known to be cytoprotective in various pathological conditions through anti-cell death and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. The present study investigated the neuroprotective effect of ethyl pyruvate using a mouse model of collagenase-induced intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Our results showed that EP treatment to mice reduced brain edema and improved neurological function after ICH. Delayed treatment with EP until 6 h after ICH to mice was still neuroprotective. We further demonstrated that EP protected neurons from hemoglobin-induced cell death in vitro and neuronal cell degeneration in ICH mice. Moreover, EP exerted anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting microglia activation, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) DNA binding activity and subsequent downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β)) production. Taken together, these results suggest that EP exerts neuroprotective effect via anti-cell death and anti-inflammatory actions. EP is a potential novel treatment for ICH patients and deserves further investigation.

AB  - Abstract
When a consolidated memory is reactivated, it can become labile and prone to enhancement or disruption, a process known as reconsolidation. The reconsolidation hypothesis has challenged the traditional view that memories after consolidation are fixed and unchangeable. Recent studies suggest that the mechanisms mediating memory retrieval and the mechanisms that underlie the behavioral expression of memory can be dissociated, offering a new promise for the understanding of human memory persistence. Although reconsolidation studies typically use amnesic agents, it has also been shown that memory can be enhanced by pharmacological agents and real-life events during reconsolidation. Recently, we demonstrated that a mild stressor, cold pressor stress (CPS), can enhance human declarative memory during reconsolidation in a cued-recall test. Here we evaluate whether the recollection of 7- or 20-day-old long-term memories can be improved by exposure to two different neuromodulators: a mild stressor and glucose during reconsolidation. As expected, poor and very poor memory performance was found at the time of memory reactivation (days 6 and 20 after training). CPS during reconsolidation improved the long-term expression of a declarative memory 6 -but not 20-days after training. However, the administration of an oral source of glucose (juice), but not a diet juice, can enhance memory during reconsolidation even 20 days after training. Interestingly, when a recognition test was applied instead of a cued-recall test, memory performance was still robust at both 1 and 3 weeks after training. Here we show that the period in which this memory can be reactivated and become labile largely exceeds the period in which that memory is recalled, proving evidence that conscious access is not needed for reconsolidation. Present results are consistent with dissociation between the mechanisms mediating memory labilization and the mechanisms that underlie the behavioral expression of memory.

AB  - AbstractBackground
Iron deficiency has been documented to affect human cognitive function and conditions with brain iron compromise such as the restless legs syndrome (RLS). Intravenous (IV) iron treatment is used to reduce iron deficiency but its effects on brain iron are not known. It is not known if IV iron is effective in correcting regional brain iron deficiencies nor if it poses a risk of producing iron overload in some brain regions. Preclinical study of IV iron in the iron-deficient (ID) murine model is needed to evaluate and develop IV iron treatments for brain iron deficiency.
Methods
Response to tail vein injections of iron (iron isomaltoside-1000, dose equivalent to 1000 mg for 75 kg adult) or vehicle were evaluated for ID mice by microdialysis assessing non-transferrin bound (NTB) iron in the ventral midbrain (VMB) and autopsy at 3 and 10 days post-injection assessing iron content in critical brain regions.
Results
The ID mice showed marked circadian variation in NTB extracellular iron. After iron injection, NTB iron was rapidly increased in the VMB and then decreased over 12 h to the levels observed for vehicle. Regional brain iron content at 3 and 10 days post-injection in the iron- compared to vehicle-treated group showed significantly more iron for the VMB and nucleus accumbens but not for the other regions (i.e. prefrontal cortex, caudate–putamen, cerebellum, and pons), which also did not show decreased iron content with the ID diet.
Conclusion
Iron isomaltoside-1000 given IV corrects the regional brain iron deficiency in these ID mice without producing iron overload in any of the brain regions studied. This is the first demonstration of effects of IV iron in the brain and it provides a useful preclinical model for this assessment, particularly relevant for developing iron treatments for conditions with problematic iron deficiency, e.g. RLS.

AB  - Abstract
Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors after stroke enhances motor functional recovery; however, the underlying mechanisms remain to be further elucidated. We hypothesized that daily administration of the clinical drug citalopram would produce these functional benefits via enhancing neurovascular repair in the ischemic peri-infarct region. To test this hypothesis, focal ischemic stroke was induced in male C57/B6 mice by permanent ligation of distal branches of the middle cerebral artery to the barrel cortex and 7-min occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries. Citalopram (10 mg/kg, i.p.) was injected 24 h after stroke and daily thereafter. To label proliferating cells, bromo-deoxyuridine was injected daily beginning 3 days after stroke. Immunohistochemical and functional assays were performed to elucidate citalopram-mediated cellular and sensorimotor changes after stroke. Citalopram treatment had no significant effect on infarct formation or edema 3 days after stroke; however, citalopram-treated mice had better functional recovery than saline-treated controls 3 and 14 days after stroke in the adhesive removal test. Increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor was detected in the peri-infarct region 7 days after stroke in citalopram-treated animals. The number of proliferating neural progenitor cells and the distance of neuroblast migration from the sub-ventricular zone toward the ischemic cortex were significantly greater in citalopram-treated mice at 7 days after stroke. Immunohistochemical staining and co-localization analysis showed that citalopram-treated animals generated more new neurons and microvessels in the peri-infarct region 21 and 28 days after stroke. Taken together, these results suggest that citalopram promotes post-stroke sensorimotor recovery likely via enhancing neurogenesis, neural cell migration and the microvessel support in the peri-infarct region of the ischemic brain.

AB  - Abstract
The Kavli Prize in Neuroscience was awarded for the third time in September 2012, by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters in Oslo. The accompanying Kavli Prize Symposium on Neuroscience, held in Bergen and Trondheim, was a showcase of excellence in neuroscience research. The common theme of the Symposium presentations was the mechanisms by which animals adapt to their environment. The symposium speakers – Michael Greenberg, Erin Schuman, Chiara Cirelli, Michael Meaney, Catherine Dulac, Hopi Hoekstra, and Stanislas Dehaene – covered topics ranging from the molecular and cellular levels to the systems level and behavior. Thus a single amino acid change in a transcriptional repressor can disrupt gene regulation through neural activity (Greenberg). Deep sequencing analysis of the neuropil transcriptome indicates that a large fraction of the synaptic proteome is synthesized in situ in axons and dendrites, permitting local regulation (Schuman). The nature of the ‘reset’ function that makes animals dependent of sleep is being revealed (Cirelli). Maternal behavior can cause changes in gene expression that stably modify behavior in the offspring (Meaney). Removal of a single sensory channel protein in the vomero-nasal organ can switch off male-specific and switch on female-specific innate behavior of mice in response to environmental stimulation (Dulac). Innate behaviors can be stably transmitted from parent to offspring through generations even when those behaviors cannot be expressed, as illustrated by the elaborate burrowing behavior in a rodent species, in which independent genetic regions regulate distinct modules of the burrowing pattern (Hoekstra). Finally, at the other extreme of the nature-nurture scale, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis in children and adults identified a brain area specifically involved in reading (Dehaene). As the area must originally have developed for a purpose other than reading, such as shape recognition, this illustrates the use of a previously formed neural structure to tackle a new challenge.

AB  - Abstract
Little is known on how the CNS would select its movement options when a person faces a novel or recurring perturbation of two opposing types (slip or trip) while walking. The purposes of this study were (1) to determine whether young adults’ adaptation to repeated slips would interfere with their recovery from a novel trip, and (2) to investigate the generalized strategies after they were exposed to a mixed training with both types of perturbation. Thirty-two young adults were assigned to either the training group, which first underwent repeated-slip training before encountering a novel, unannounced trip while walking, or to the control group, which only experienced the same novel, unannounced trip. The former group would then experience a mix of repeated trips and slips. The results indicated that prior adaptation to slips had only limited interference during the initial phase of trip recovery. In fact, the prior repeated-slip exposure had primed their reaction, which mitigated any error resulting from early interference. As a result, they did not have to take a longer compensatory step for trip recovery than did the controls. After the mixed training, subjects were able to converge effectively the motion state of their center of mass (in its position and velocity space) to a stable and generalized “middle ground” steady-state. Such movement strategies not only further strengthened their robust reactive control of stability, but also reduced the CNS’ overall reliance on accurate context prediction and on feedback correction of perturbation-induced movement error.

AB  - Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting the dopaminergic neurons in the nigrastriatal pathway resulting in debilitating motor impairment in both familial and sporadic cases. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have been recently implicated as a therapeutic candidate because of their ability to correct the disrupted HDAC activity in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Sodium butyrate (SB), an HDAC inhibitor, reduces degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in a mutant alpha-synuclein Drosophila transgenic model of familial PD. Chronic exposure to the pesticide rotenone also causes selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and causes locomotor impairment and early mortality in a Drosophila model of chemically induced PD. This study investigated the effects of sodium butyrate on locomotor impairment and early mortality in a rotenone-induced PD model. We show that treatment with 10 mM SB-supplemented food rescued the rotenone-induced locomotor impairment and early mortality in flies. Additionally, flies with the genetic knockdown of HDAC activity through Sin3A loss-of-function mutation (Sin3Alof) were resistant to rotenone-induced locomotor impairment and early mortality. Furthermore, SB-supplemented Sin3Alof flies had a modest additive effect for improving locomotor impairment. We also show SB-mediated improvement of rotenone-induced locomotor impairment was associated with elevated dopamine levels in the brain. However, the possibility of SB-mediated protective role through mechanisms independent from dopamine system is also discussed. These findings demonstrate that HDAC inhibitors like SB can ameliorate locomotor impairment in a rotenone-induced PD model.

AB  - Abstract
Neural mechanisms underlying the capacity of memory to be rich in sensory detail are largely unknown. A candidate mechanism is learning-induced plasticity that remodels the adult sensory cortex. Here, expansion in the primary auditory cortical (A1) tonotopic map of rats was induced by pairing a 3.66-kHz tone with activation of the nucleus basalis, mimicking the effects of natural associative learning. Remodeling of A1 produced de novo specific behavioral memory, but neither memory nor plasticity was consistently at the frequency of the paired tone, which typically decreased in A1 representation. Rather, there was a specific match between individual subjects’ area of expansion and the tone that was strongest in each animal’s memory, as determined by post-training frequency generalization gradients. These findings provide the first demonstration of a match between the artificial induction of specific neural representational plasticity and artificial induction of behavioral memory. As such, together with prior and present findings for detection, correlation and mimicry of plasticity with the acquisition of memory, they satisfy a key criterion for neural substrates of memory. This demonstrates that directly remodeling sensory cortical maps is sufficient for the specificity of memory formation.

AB  - Abstract
The accessory nerve (nervus accessorius) displays a unique organization in that its axons ascend along the rostrocaudal axis after exiting the cervical spinal cord and medulla oblongata and thereafter project ventrally into the periphery at the first somite level. Little is known about how this organization is achieved. We have investigated the role of somites in the guidance of motor axons of the accessory nerve using heterotopic transplantations of somites in avian embryos. The formation of not only accessory nerve but also the vagal nerve was affected, when a more caudal occipital somite (somites 2–4) was grafted to the position of the first occipital somite. Our study reveals that only the first occipital somite permits the development of ventral projection of accessory axons, a process that is inhibited by more caudal occipital somites.

AB  - AbstractObjective
Step initiation can be modified by environmental stimulations, suggesting the involvement of stimulus-driven attention. Therefore, we assessed the influence of attentional status during step preparation.
Methods
Fourteen healthy, young subjects were presented with an auditory oddball paradigm in which an infrequent “target” stimulus was presented among frequent “standard” stimuli. An imperative visual “Go” signal for step initiation was presented 1.4 s after the auditory stimulus. Both the P300 event-related potential (associated with the auditory attention task) and the trajectory of the centre of pressure (associated with step initiation) were recorded.
Results
When presented before the visual “Go” signal, the auditory stimuli prompted the early release of low-amplitude anticipatory postural adjustments, not followed by step execution. They occurred twice as frequently in the “target” condition as they did in the “standard” condition. P300 component was greater after presentation of the target stimulus than after presentation of the standard stimulus.
Conclusion
Stimulus-driven attention can modify the release of anticipatory postural adjustments.
Significance
The cortical integration of an auditory stimulus (as evidenced by the P300 component) in a subject conditioned to initiate gait appears to release postural adjustments via two different attentional mechanisms: an “alerting effect” and an “orienting effect”.

AB  - Abstract
Illumination conditions appear to influence working efficacy in everyday life. In the present study, we obtained electroencephalogram (EEG) correlates of working-memory load, and investigated how these waveforms are modulated by illumination conditions. We hypothesized that illumination conditions may affect cognitive performance. We designed an EEG study to monitor and record participants’ EEG during the Sternberg working memory task under four different illumination conditions. Illumination conditions were generated with a factorial design of two color-temperatures (3000 and 7100 K) by two illuminance levels (150 and 700 lx). During a working memory task, we observed that high illuminance led to significantly lower frontal EEG theta activity than did low illuminance. These differences persisted despite no significant difference in task performance between illumination conditions. We found that the latency of an early event-related potential component, such as N1, was significantly modulated by the illumination condition. The fact that the illumination condition affects brain activity but not behavioral performance suggests that the lighting conditions used in the present study did not influence the performance stage of behavioral processing. Nevertheless, our findings provide objective evidence that illumination conditions modulate brain activity. Further studies are necessary to refine the optimal lighting parameters for facilitating working memory.

AB  - Abstract
Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), a neuropeptide contained in neural terminals innervating brainstem vagal motor neurons, enhances vagal outflow to modify multisystemic visceral functions and food intake. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity are accompanied by impaired vagal functioning. We examined the possibility that impaired brainstem TRH action may contribute to the vagal dysregulation of food intake in Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats, a T2D model with hyperglycemia and impaired central vagal activation by TRH. Food intake induced by intracisternal injection of TRH analog was reduced significantly by 50% in GK rats, compared to Wistar rats. Similarly, natural food intake in the dark phase or food intake after an overnight fast was reduced by 56–81% in GK rats. Fasting (48 h) and refeeding (2 h)-associated changes in serum ghrelin, insulin, peptide YY, pancreatic polypeptide and leptin, and the concomitant changes in orexigenic or anorexigenic peptide expression in the brainstem and hypothalamus, all apparent in Wistar rats, were absent or markedly reduced in GK rats, with hormone release stimulated by vagal activation, such as ghrelin and pancreatic polypeptide, decreased substantially. Fasting-induced Fos expression accompanying endogenous brainstem TRH action decreased by 66% and 91%, respectively, in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) in GK rats, compared to Wistar rats. Refeeding abolished fasting-induced Fos-expression in the NTS, while that in the DMV remained in Wistar but not GK rats. These findings indicate that dysfunctional brainstem TRH-elicited vagal impairment contributes to the disturbed food intake in T2D GK rats, and may provide a pathophysiological mechanism which prevents further weight gain in T2D and obesity.

AB  - Abstract
Accumulating evidence indicates that activation of spinal cord astrocytes contributes importantly to nerve injury and inflammation-induced persistent pain and chronic opioid-induced antinociceptive tolerance. Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK) and induction of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) in spinal astrocytes have been implicated in astrocytes-mediated pain. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a serine protease that has been extensively used to treat stroke. We examined the potential involvement of tPA in chronic opioid-induced antinociceptive tolerance and activation of spinal astrocytes using tPA knockout (tPA−/−) mice and astrocyte cultures. tPA−/− mice exhibited unaltered nociceptive pain and morphine-induced acute analgesia. However, the antinociceptive tolerance, induced by chronic morphine (10 mg/kg/day, s.c.), is abrogated in tPA−/− mice. Chronic morphine induces tPA expression in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-expressing spinal cord astrocytes. Chronic morphine also increases IL-1β expression in GFAP-expressing astrocytes, which is abolished in tPA-deficient mice. In cultured astrocytes, morphine treatment increases tPA, IL-1β, and pERK expression, and the increased IL-1β and pERK expression is abolished in tPA-deficient astrocytes. tPA is also sufficient to induce IL-1β and pERK expression in astrocyte cultures. Intrathecal injection of tPA results in up-regulation of GFAP and pERK in spinal astrocytes but not up-regulation of ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1 in spinal microglia. Finally, intrathecal tPA elicits persistent mechanical allodynia, which is inhibited by the astroglial toxin alpha-amino adipate and the MEK (ERK kinase) inhibitor U0126. Collectively, these data suggest an important role of tPA in regulating astrocytic signaling, pain hypersensitivity, and morphine tolerance.

AB  - Abstract
Synapsins are nerve-terminal proteins that are linked to synaptic transmission and key factors in several forms of synaptic plasticity. While synapsins are generally assumed to be ubiquitous in synaptic terminals, whether they are excluded from certain types of terminals is of interest. In the visual pathway, synapsins are lacking in photoreceptor and bipolar cell terminals as well as in retinogeniculate synapses. These are the terminals of the first three feedforward synapses in the visual pathway, implying that lack of synapsins may be a common property of terminals that provide the primary driver activity onto their postsynaptic neurons. To further investigate this idea, we studied the fourth driver synapse, thalamocortical synapses in visual cortex, using glutamatergic terminal antibody markers anti-VGluT1 and VGluT2, anti-Synapsin I and II, and confocal microscopy to analyze co-localization of these proteins in terminals. We also used pre-embedding immunocytochemical labeling followed by electron microscopy to investigate morphological similarities or differences between terminals containing synapsins or VGluT2. In visual cortex, synapsin coincided extensively with non-TC-neuron marker, VGluT1, while thalamocortical terminal marker VGluT2 and synapsin overlap was sparse. Morphologically, synapsin-stained terminals were smaller than non-stained, while VGluT2-positive thalamocortical terminals constituted the largest terminals in cortex. The size discrepancy between synapsin- and VGluT2-positive terminals, together with the complementary staining patterns, indicates that thalamocortical synapses are devoid of synapsins, and support the hypothesis that afferent sensory information is consistently transmitted without the involvement of synapsins. Furthermore, VGluT2 and synapsins were colocalized in other brain structures, suggesting that lack of synapsins is not a property of VGluT2-containing terminals, but a property of primary driver terminals in the visual system.

AB  - Abstract
Glutathione (GSH) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) are thiol-containing antioxidants, and also act through a direct reaction with free radicals. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is the principal transduction channel serving as a polymodal detector. Despite the importance of oxidative stress in pain sensitivity, its role in TRPV1 modulation is poorly understood. NAC may also have a regulator role on TRPV1 channel activity in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron. Therefore, we tested the effects of GSH and NAC on TRPV1 channel current, Ca2+ influx, oxidative stress and caspase activity in the DRG of mice.

DRG neurons were freshly isolated from mice and the neurons were incubated for 6 and 24 h with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO). Pretreatment of cultured DRG neurons with NAC, results in a protection against oxidative damages. This neuroprotection is associated with the attenuation of a Ca2+ influx triggered by oxidative agents such as H2O2, 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and GSH depletion via BSO. Here, we demonstrate the contribution of cytosolic factors (related to thiol group depletion) on the activation of TRPV1 channels in this mechanism. TRPV1 channels are activated by various agents including capsaicin (CAP), the pungent component of hot chili peppers, and are blocked by capsazepine. An oxidative environment also increased CAP-evoked TRPV1 currents in the neurons. When NAC and GSH were included in the patch pipette as well as extracellularly in the chamber, TRPV1 channels were not activated by CAP and H2O2. TRPV1 inhibitors, 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate and N-(p-amylcinnamoyl)anthranilic acid strongly reduced BSO-induced oxidative toxicity and Ca2+ influx, in a manner similar to pretreatment with NAC and GSH. Caspase-3 and -9 activities of all groups were not changed by the agonists or antagonists.

In conclusion, in our experimental model, TRPV1 channels are involved in the oxidative stress-induced neuronal death, and negative modulation of this channel activity by GSH and NAC pretreatment may account for their neuroprotective activity against oxidative stress.

AB  - Abstract
The present study evaluated, using immunohistochemical methods, the presence and characteristics of proliferating and newly generated neurons in the brain of eight wild-caught adult Megachiropteran species. For the neurogenic patterns observed, direct homologies are evident in other mammalian species; however, there were several distinctions in the presence or absence of proliferating and immature neurons, and migratory streams that provide important clues regarding the use of the brain in the analysis of Chiropteran phylogenetic affinities. In all eight species studied, numerous Ki-67- and doublecortin (DCX)-immunopositive cells were identified in the subventricular zone (SVZ). These cells migrated to the olfactory bulb through a Primate-like rostral migratory stream (RMS) that is composed of dorsal and ventral substreams which merge before entering the olfactory bulb. Some cells were observed emerging from the RMS coursing caudally and dorsally to the rostral neocortex. In the dentate gyrus of all species, Ki-67- and DCX-expressing cells were observed in the granular cell layer and hilus. Similar to Primates, proliferating cells and immature neurons were identified in the SVZ of the temporal horn of Megachiropterans. These cells migrated to the rostral and caudal piriform cortex through a Primate-like temporal migratory stream. Sparsely distributed Ki-67-immunopositive, but DCX-immunonegative, cells were identified in the tectum, brainstem and cerebellum. The observations from this study add to a number of neural characteristics that phylogenetically align Megachiropterans to Primates.

AB  - Glutamate is the major mediator of excitotoxic neuronal death following cerebral ischemia. Under severe ischemic conditions, glutamate transporters can functionally reverse to release glutamate, thereby inducing further neuronal injury. Hypothermia has been shown to protect neurons from brain ischemia. However, the mechanism(s) involved remain unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism(s) mediating glutamate release during brain ischemia–reperfusion injury under hypothermic conditions. Neuron/astrocyte co-cultures were exposed to oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) at various temperatures for 2 h, and cell viability was assayed 12 h after reoxygenation. PI and MAP-2 staining demonstrated that hypothermia significantly decreased neuronal injury. Furthermore, [3H]-glutamate uptake assays showed that hypothermia protected rat primary cortical cultures against OGD reoxygenation-induced injury. Protein levels of the astrocytic glutamate transporter, GLT-1, which is primarily responsible for the clearance of extracellular glutamate, were also found to be reduced in a temperature-dependent manner. In contrast, expression of GLT-1 in astrocyte-enriched cultures was found to significantly increase following the addition of neuron-conditioned medium maintained at 37 °C, and to a lesser extent with neuron-conditioned medium at 33 °C. In conclusion, the neuroprotective effects of hypothermia against brain ischemia–reperfusion injury involve down-regulation of astrocytic GLT-1, which mediates the reverse transport of glutamate. Moreover, this process may be regulated by molecules secreted by stressed neurons.

AB  - A proper maturation of stereoscopic functions requires binocular visual experience and early disruption of sensory-driven activity can result in long-term or even permanent visual function impairment. Amblyopia is one paradigmatic case of visual system disorder, with early conditions of functional imbalance between the two eyes leading to severe deficits of visual acuity and depth-perception abilities. In parallel to the reduction of neural plasticity levels, the brain potential for functional recovery declines with age. Recent evidence has challenged this traditional view and experimental paradigms enhancing experience-dependent plasticity in the adult brain have been described. Here, we show that environmental enrichment (EE), a condition of increased cognitive and sensory-motor stimulation, restores experience-dependent plasticity of stereoscopic perception in response to sensory deprivation well after the end of the critical period and reinstates depth-perception abilities of adult amblyopic animals in the range of normal values. Our results encourage efforts in the clinical application of paradigms based on EE as an intervention strategy for treating amblyopia in adulthood.

AB  - Disturbances in olfactory circuitry have been associated with depression in humans. The olfactory bulbectomized (OBX lesion) has been largely used as a model of depression-like behavior in the rat. However, quantitative neuronal rearrangements in key brain regions in this animal model have not been evaluated yet. Accordingly, we investigated changes in hippocampal plasticity as well as behavioral deficits in this animal model. OBX-induced behavioral deficits were studied in a battery of tests, namely the open field test (OFT), forced swim test (FST), and spatial memory disturbances in the Morris water maze (MWM). To characterize the neuronal remodeling, neuroanatomical rearrangements were investigated in the CA1 hippocampus and piriform cortex (PirC), brain regions receiving inputs from the olfactory bulbs and associated with emotional or olfactory processes. Additionally, cell proliferation and survival of newborn cells in the adult dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus were also determined. OBX induced hyperlocomotion and enhanced rearing and grooming in the OFT, increased immobility in the FST as well as required a longer time to find the hidden platform in the MWM. OBX also induced dendritic atrophy in the hippocampus and PirC. In addition, cell proliferation was decreased while the survival remained unchanged in the DG of these animals. These various features are also observed in depressed subjects, adding further support to the validity and usefulness of this model to evaluate potential novel antidepressants.

AB  - Background
Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients have an increased gait asymmetry and variability, which is most pronounced in patients with freezing of gait (FOG). We examined if stride time variability and deficits in interlimb coordination between the upper and lower limbs would increase during split-belt locomotion in PD, and particularly so in patients with FOG.
Methods
Fourteen PD patients (seven with FOG, matched for disease severity with the seven non-freezers) and 10 healthy controls walked on a treadmill with split belts at different speeds (2 versus 3 km/h). Gait was recorded by means of a video motion analysis system. Outcome measures were stride length asymmetry and variability, stride time asymmetry and variability, ipsilateral and contralateral interlimb coordination, and phase coordination index.
Results
Both PD subjects and controls were able to adapt to split-belt walking by modulating their stride length. However, freezers showed a larger increase in stride time asymmetry and stride time variability due to split-belt walking compared to non-freezers. Furthermore, contralateral interlimb coordination improved in control subjects during split-belt walking, but not in PD patients (freezers and non-freezers). Phase coordination index did not change differently across the three groups.
Conclusions
The ability to walk under split-belt conditions was preserved in PD. Non-freezers and controls compensated for the experimentally increased stride length asymmetry by decreasing their stride time asymmetry. This ability was lost in freezers, who in fact increased their stride time asymmetry during split-belt walking. As a result, stride time variability also increased in freezers. These findings support the hypothesis that FOG is related to gait asymmetries and to gait timing deficits.

In the current study, we used a proteomics-based approach, combining two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) with mass spectrometry (MS), to analyze protein expression profiles of rat mPFC after repeated cocaine exposure. Conditioned place preference (CPP) assay was used here to evaluate cocaine-induced reward effect in rats. We detected about 3100 protein spots in rat mPFC. After repeated cocaine exposure, 125 spots were changed by more than 1.1-fold of control levels. Among them, 71 spots with 1.5-fold or greater changes in protein expression over control levels have been identified, including 50 spots that were up-regulated and 21 spots that were down-regulated by repeated cocaine exposure. These identified proteins that showed significant changes in expression in mPFC after repeated cocaine exposure may be useful biomarkers for assessing cocaine abuse and potential new targets for investigating the mechanism of cocaine abuse.

AB  - Prion protein (PrP) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored cell surface protein expressed by many cells, including those of the mammalian nervous system. At present the physiologic functions of PrP remain unclear. Deletion of Prnp, the gene encoding PrP in mice, has been shown to alter normal synaptic and electrophysiologic activities, indicating a potential role in seizure susceptibility. However, published efforts to link PrP with seizures, using both in vivo and in vitro models, are conflicting and difficult to interpret due to use of various mouse backgrounds and seizure induction techniques. Here we investigated the role of PrP in kainic acid (KA)-induced seizure sensitivity, using three types of mice. In contrast to previous published results, Prnp−/− mice on the C57BL/10SnJ background had a significant decrease in KA-induced seizure susceptibility. In genetic complementation experiments using a PrP-expressing transgene, genes derived from strain 129/Ola, which flanked the Prnp−/− locus in C57BL/10SnJ mice, rather than Prnp itself, appeared to account for this effect. Furthermore, using coisogenic 129/Ola mice differing only at Prnp, this difference was not reproduced when comparing PrP-negative and PrP-positive mice. In contrast, substrains of PrP-expressing C57BL mice, showed large variations in KA-induced seizure sensitivity. The magnitude of these differences in susceptibility was larger than that associated with the presence of the Prnp gene, suggesting extensive influence of genes other than Prnp on seizure sensitivity in this system.

AB  - While various changes occur after spinal cord lesions, their influence on functional recovery is generally unclear. We have shown changes in proprioceptor and locomotor network properties below lesion sites in the lamprey spinal cord. The proprioceptive system offers a particularly tractable model for analyzing these changes. Here, we have sought evidence for changes in neuromodulatory effects below lesion sites by comparing the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and somatostatin, both of which are located around the edge cells, on proprioceptive responses in lesioned and unlesioned spinal cords.

Exogenously applied GABA significantly reduced or abolished bending-evoked responses in unlesioned animals. In lesioned animals bending-evoked responses were stronger and certain of the effects of exogenously applied GABA were reduced. However, blocking endogenous GABA with bicuculline significantly potentiated responses in lesioned but not unlesioned animals. This suggested that the potentiated responses in lesioned animals were nevertheless associated with stronger tonic GABAergic inhibition. There were significant differences in these effects when lesioned animals were separated on the basis of their degree of recovery: notably, bicuculline only potentiated responses in animals that recovered good locomotor function, suggesting a need for raised endogenous GABA levels. Somatostatin alone did not affect edge cell responses in lesioned or unlesioned animals, but in lesioned animals it reduced and thus further weakened the inhibitory effects of GABA.

There are thus multiple changes in sensory modulation in the lesioned spinal cord, and differences in these effects may influence the degree of recovery.

AB  - Stress has long been associated with the development of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. The effects of stress vary depending upon the age during which the stress is incurred, the duration and severity of the stressor, and can further be influenced by levels of circulating gonadal hormones. To date, the majority of research investigating the link between stress and pathology development has focused on stress hormone secretion, receptor activity, and their impact on neuronal development and functioning in developing and adult male and female rodents. In recent years, work has begun to focus on additional neuromodulatory systems that may be significantly impacted by stress that may explain changes in developmental and sex-based susceptibility to stress. New research targets include molecules that play a role in neuronal development and plasticity. Specifically, stress-induced alterations in growth factors such as neurotrophins, in particular brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), have been identified as a strong candidate modulating stress-associated pathology. Furthermore, changing expression of BDNF and its receptors over development and in response to circulating gonadal hormones extend the attractiveness of this candidate signaling pathway for understanding differences in susceptibility to stress. This review focuses on what is known with regard to the effects of stress on neurotrophin expression in rodents, and the varied effects of stress on BDNF levels as a function of developmental status and sex.

AB  - Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) play a major role during the development of the central nervous system (CNS). Ca2+ influx via VGCCs regulates axonal growth and neuronal migration as well as synaptic plasticity. Specifically, L-type VGCCs have been well characterized to be involved in the formation and refinement of the connections within the CA3 region of the hippocampus. The majority of the growth, formation, and refinement in the CNS occurs during the third trimester of human pregnancy. An equivalent developmental time period in rodents occurs during the first 2 weeks of post-natal life, and the expression pattern of L-type VGCCs during this time period has not been well characterized. In this study, we show that Cav1.2 channels are more highly expressed during this developmental period compared to adolescence (post-natal day 30) and that L-type VGCCs significantly contribute to the overall Ca2+ currents. These findings suggest that L-type VGCCs are functionally expressed during the crucial developmental period.

AB  - Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is involved in innate immunity in the brain and in the cascade of events after ischemic stroke. The aim of this study was to get an insight into the expression of genes related to TLR2 signaling pathway and associated with inflammation and apoptosis in the later stages of brain response after ischemic injury. Middle cerebral artery occlusion was performed on both wild-type and TLR2−/− mice followed by real-time PCR to measure the relative expression of selected genes. In TLR2−/− mice expression of genes involved in proinflammatory response was decreased after cerebral ischemia. Tnf was the most prominent cytokine active in the late phase of recovery. Contrary to proinflammatory genes, the expression of Casp8, as a hallmark of apoptosis, was increased in TLR2−/− mice, in particular in the late phase of recovery.

AB  - Corticokinematic coherence (CKC) refers to coupling between magnetoencephalographic (MEG) brain activity and hand kinematics. For voluntary hand movements, CKC originates mainly from the primary sensorimotor (SM1) cortex.

To learn about the relative motor and sensory contributions to CKC, we recorded CKC from 15 healthy subjects during active and passive right index-finger movements. The fingertip was either touching or not touching table, resulting in active-touch, active-no-touch, passive-touch, and passive-no-touch conditions. The kinematics of the index-finger was measured with a 3-axis accelerometer. Beamformer analysis was used to locate brain activations for the movements; somatosensory-evoked fields (SEFs) elicited by pneumatic tactile stimulation of the index finger served as a functional landmark for cutaneous input.

All active and passive movements resulted in statistically significant CKC at the movement frequency (F0) and its first harmonic (F1). The main CKC sources at F0 and F1 were in the contralateral SM1 cortex with no spatial differences between conditions, and distinct from the SEF sources. At F1, the coherence was by two thirds stronger for passive than active movements, with no difference between touch vs. no-touch conditions.

Our results suggest that the CKC occurring during repetitive finger movements is mainly driven by somatosensory, primarily proprioceptive, afferent input to the SM1 cortex, with negligible effect of cutaneous input.

AB  - In the current study the link among the γ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB)/pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced absence-like seizures and concomitant decreases in the core temperature, as well as electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during rewarming from deep hypothermia produced by a drug-free protocol were investigated. During the rewarming period after deep cooling, most Wistar rats suffered from bilaterally synchronous spike and waves with no or mild behavioral correlates. Spike and wave seizures were temperature-dependent and were initially registered when body temperature (Tb) reached 25–27 °C, but mostly during the mild hypothermia of 0.3–1.3 °C (Tb of 36.3–37.3 °C). In chemical absence models, spike and wave discharges were also closely accompanied by mild systemic hypothermia, as both PTZ- and GHB-induced temperature decreases ranged from about 1–1.4 °C respectively, together with EEG markers of absence activity. Thus, throughout the different experimental designs, the occurrence of spike and wave discharges was always related to a mild (0.3–1.4 °C) decrease of Tb. Benzodiazepine diazepam as the GABAA-positive allosteric modulator and CGP 62349 as the selective antagonist of GABAB receptors were used to determine if their well-known anticonvulsant properties also affect hypothermia elicited by these drugs. Finally, during the course of spontaneous rewarming from deep hypothermia, another selective GABAB-blocking agent, CGP 35348, was used to elucidate if GABAB inhibitory system could be critically implicated in the generation of hypothermia-dependent spike and waves. Diazepam prevented both the PTZ-induced hypothermia and electrographic absence seizures, but these two beneficial effects did not occur in the GHB model. Even though diazepam delayed GHB-induced maximal temperature decrease, the GHB effects remained highly significant. The GABAB antagonist CGP 62349 completely prevented hypothermia as well as absence seizures in both chemical models. Likewise, spike and wave discharges, registered during the spontaneous rewarming from deep hypothermia, were completely prevented by CGP 35348. These findings show that systemic hypothermia should definitely be regarded as a marker of GABAB receptor activation. Moreover, the results of this study clearly show that initial mild temperature decrease should be considered as strong absence-provoking factor. Hypothermia-induced nonconvulsive seizures also highlight the importance of continuous EEG monitoring in children undergoing therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest. Since every change in peripheral or systemic temperature ultimately must be perceived by preoptic region of the anterior hypothalamus as the primary thermoregulatory and sleep-inducing center, the preoptic thermosensitive neurons in general and warm-sensitive neurons in particular, simply have to be regarded as the most probable candidate for connected thermoregulatory and absence generating mechanisms. Therefore, additional studies are needed to confirm their potential role in the generation and propagation of absence seizures.

AB  - Insulin plays diverse roles, including learning and memory, in the central nervous system. SIRT1 has been reported to be involved in the processes of normal learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity. However, whether insulin is directly involved in regulating SIRT1 expression in neurons or whether it affects synapses remains largely unknown. Here, we show that insulin promotes neurite outgrowth and increases SIRT1 expression in SH-SY5Y cells. LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, inhibited the expression of insulin-induced increases in SIRT1. Conversely, the downregulation of SIRT1 using a SIRT1 inhibitor and SIRT1-siRNA resulted in a significant reduction in the length of neurite outgrowth. Taken together, these results suggest that the regulation of SIRT1 by insulin is important for the neurite outgrowth of neuroblastoma cells.

AB  - There is growing evidence that vitamin D is a neuroactive steroid capable of regulating multiple pathways important for both brain development and mature brain function. In particular, there is evidence from rodent models that prenatal vitamin D deficiency alters the development of dopaminergic pathways and this disruption is associated with altered behavior and neurochemistry in the adult brain. Although the presence of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) has been noted in the human substantia nigra, there is a lack of direct evidence showing that VDR is present in dopaminergic cells. Here we confirm that the VDR is present in the nucleus of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in both the human and rat substantia nigra, and it emerges early in development in the rat, between embryonic day 12 (E12) and E15. Consistent evidence based on immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR and western blot confirmed a pattern of increasing VDR expression in the rat midbrain until weaning. The nuclear expression of VDR in TH-positive neurons during critical periods of brain development suggests that alterations in early life vitamin D status may influence the orderly development of dopaminergic neurons.

AB  - Humans are highly efficient in moving in a world of variable resistive forces which result, e.g., from different masses of objects or different directions of movements relative to gravity. However, the underlying mechanisms are challenged when an opposing force is suddenly removed. The resulting involuntary movements are known as accident risks in everyday life. We studied their characteristics upon abrupt cessations of opposing forces of 1, 2, and 4 N which were presented in a series of variable or constant forces. The characteristics of the involuntary hand movements are largely determined by the mechanical impedance of the limb. The involuntary movements are oscillatory in nature, and their amplitude increases with stronger opposing force. Limb impedance is modulated both in a reactive and in an anticipatory manner. The reactive modulation occurs during each involuntary movement as a consequence of the neural responses elicited by the rapid limb acceleration consequent upon the cessation of the opposing force. Anticipatory modulation of limb impedance may serve to produce similar involuntary movements in spite of different opposing forces. The modulation is thus stronger with variable forces, where differences between resulting involuntary movements can be experienced more easily, than with constant forces.

AB  - Neuroprotection by 17β-estradiol and an estrogen receptor (ER) agonist against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) lesion were shown to implicate protein kinase B (Akt) signaling in mice. In order to evaluate the associated mechanisms, this study compared estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) intact or knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) C57Bl/6 male mice following MPTP treatment of 7, 9, 11 mg/kg and/or 17β-estradiol. Striatal D1 and D2 dopamine (DA) receptors were measured by autoradiography with the specific ligands [3H]-SCH 23390 and [3H]-raclopride, respectively and signaling by Western blot for Akt, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and extracellular-regulated signal kinases (ERK1 and ERK2). Control ERKOβ mice had lower striatal [3H]-SCH 23390 specific binding than WT and ERKOα mice; both KO mice had lower [3H]-raclopride specific binding. Striatal D1 receptors decreased with increasing doses of MPTP in correlation with striatal DA concentrations in ERKOα mice and remained unchanged in WT and ERKOβ mice. Striatal D2 receptors decreased with increasing doses of MPTP in correlation with striatal DA concentrations in WT and ERKOα mice and increased in ERKOβ mice. In MPTP-lesioned mice, 17β-estradiol treatment increased D1 receptors in ERKOα and ERKOβ mice and D2 receptors in WT and ERKOβ mice. MPTP did not affect striatal pAkt/Akt and pGSK3β/GSK3β levels in WT and ERKOα mice, while in vehicle-treated ERKOβ mice these levels were higher and increased with MPTP lesioning. Striatal pERK1/ERK1 and pERK2/ERK2 levels showed to a lesser extent a similar pattern. In conclusion, ERs affected the response of striatal DA receptors to a MPTP lesion and post receptor signaling.

AB  - In this study, we analysed facial expression detection and facial mimicry behaviour in response to an emotional empathic task. We posited that a “simulation mechanism” may be related to emotional face detection and that this mechanism could be supported by prefrontal cortical structures. To evaluate our hypothesis, we requested 16 subjects to emotionally empathise with facial stimuli and applied high frequency repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) in order to induce an increased response to the facial expressions of emotion. To determine whether emotional content affects empathic behaviour, we also varied the stimulus valence (negative vs. positive vs. neutral faces). We found that autonomic (facial zygomatic and corrugator electromyography (EMG) subjective response) and detection (correct responses (CRs); response times (RTs)) measures were modulated by the MPFC activity. Specifically, when prefrontal structures were activated, subjects displayed an increased performance in CRs and reduced RTs for face recognition, as well as increased emotion-specific EMG responses in comparison to sham effects and control site stimulation. In fact, the zygomatic muscle was more responsive in cases of positive emotion (happiness), whereas corrugator activity was more robust during periods of negative emotion (fear, anger, disgust). However, an overall stronger effect was observed in response to negative, and potentially aversive, faces when compared with responses to positive and neutral faces. Finally, a direct correlation was found between the psychophysiological responses and detection measures. In summary, these results suggest that a “simulation mechanism” underlies emotion detection in an empathic situation that includes both EMG and behavioural responses. This mechanism appears to be supported and regulated by the MPFC area.

AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a motor disorder that involves death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Parkin is an autosomal recessive gene that is mutated in early onset PD. We investigated the role of parkin and autophagic clearance in postmortem nigrostriatal tissues from 22 non-familial sporadic PD patients and 15 control samples. Parkin was insoluble with altered cytosolic expression in the nigrostriatum of sporadic PD. Parkin insolubility was associated with lack of degradation of ubiquitinated proteins and accumulation of α-Synuclein and parkin in autophagosomes, suggesting autophagic defects in PD. To test parkin’s role in mediating autophagic clearance, we used lentiviral gene transfer to express human wild type or mutant parkin (T240R) with α-Synuclein in the rat striatum. Lentiviral expression of α-Synuclein led to accumulation of autophagic vacuoles, while co-expression of parkin with α-Synuclein facilitated autophagic clearance. Subcellular fractionation showed accumulation of α-Synuclein and tau hyper-phosphorylation (p-Tau) in autophagosomes in gene transfer models, similar to the effects observed in PD brains, but parkin expression led to protein deposition into lysosomes. However, parkin loss of function mutation did not affect autophagic clearance. Taken together, these data suggest that functional parkin regulates autophagosome clearance, while decreased parkin solubility may alter normal autophagy in sporadic PD.

AB  - Ribbon synapses are tonically active high-throughput synapses. The performance of the ribbon synapse is accomplished by a specialization of the cytomatrix at the active zone (CAZ) referred to as the synaptic ribbon (SR). Progress in our understanding of the structure–function relationship at the ribbon synapse has come from observations that, in photoreceptors lacking a full-size scaffolding protein Bassoon ( Bsn Δ Ex 4 / 5 ), dissociation of SRs coincides with perturbed signal transfer. The aim of the present study has been to elaborate the role of Bassoon as a structural organizer of the ribbon synapse and to differentiate it with regard to the ambient lighting conditions. The ultrastructure of retinal ribbon synapses has been compared between wild-type (Wt) and Bsn Δ Ex 4 / 5 mice adapted to light (low activity) and darkness (high activity). The results obtained suggest that Bassoon and environmental illumination synergistically and complementarily act as organizers of the ribbon synapse. Thus, light-dependent and Bassoon-independent regulation involves initial SR tethering to the membrane and a basic shape transition of ribbon material from spherical to rod-like, since darkness induces these features in Bsn Δ Ex 4 / 5 rod spherules. However, the tight anchorage of the SR via an arciform density and the proper assembly of SRs to the full-sized horseshoe-shaped complex depend on Bassoon, as these steps fail in Bsn Δ Ex 4 / 5 rod spherules.

AB  - The capability to integrate into degenerative environment, release neurotrophic cytokines, contrast oxidative stress and an inherent differentiation potential towards siteappropriate phenotypes are considered crucial for the use of stem cells in tissue repair and regeneration. Naïve human chorial villi- (hCVCs) and amniotic fluid- (hAFCs) derived cells, whose properties and potentiality have not been extensively investigated, may represent two novel foetal cell sources for stem cell therapy. We previously described that long-term transplantation of hAFCs in the lateral ventricles of wobbler and healthy mice was feasible and safe. In the present study we examine the in vitro intrinsic stem potential of hCVCs and hAFCs for future therapeutic applications in neurodegenerative disorders.

Presence of stem lineages was evaluated assessing the expression pattern of relevant candidate markers by flow cytometry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunocytochemistry. Release of cytokines that may potentialy sustain endogenous neurogenesis and/or activate neuroprotective pathways was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). We also performed an in vitro neurorescue assay, wherein a neuroblastoma cell line damaged by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) was treated with hCVC/hAFC-derived conditioned medium (CM).

Naïve hCVCs/hAFCs show a neurogenic/angiogenic predisposition. Both cell types express several specific neural stem/progenitor markers, such as nestin and connexin 43, and release significant amounts of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, as well as vascular endothelial growth factor. hCVC and hAFC populations comprise several interesting cell lineages, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and cells with neural-like phenotypes. Moreover, although CMs obtained from both cell cultures actively sustained metabolic activity in a 6-OHDA-induced Parkinson’s disease (PD) cell model, only hCVC-derived CMs significantly reduced neurotoxin-induced apoptosis.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that naïve hAFCs and hCVCs may enhance cell-recovery following neuronal damage through multiple rescue mechanisms, and may provide a suitable means of stem cell therapy for neurodegenerative disorders including PD.

AB  - We found that an enriched environment (EE) could delay the loss of myelinated fibers in the white matter of rats during normal aging. However, the reasons for the protective effects of EE on the myelinated fibers were unclear. In this present study, via the use of stereological methods, we quantitatively investigated the myelin sheaths and the axons of myelinated fibers in the white matter of rats reared in an EE or a standard environment (SE) during the aging process. The results showed that an EE induced significant increases in the lengths of myelinated fibers, the axon volumes and the myelin sheath volumes of aging rats when compared with SE rats and that the enrichment effects, with the exception of the axon volumes, were sex- and age-independent. The mean diameter of the myelinated fibers, the mean perimeter of the myelin sheaths and the mean thicknesses of the myelin sheaths were not significantly changed. The EE-induced increase in myelinated fibers was mostly observed in those of smaller diameter (&lt;1 μm) with thinner myelin sheaths (&lt;0.16 μm), which had an optimal axon-fiber ratio (g = 0.61). Our results suggest that EE-induced an increase in myelinated fibers in the white matter of aging rats primarily due to marked remyelination and some ongoing myelination.

AB  - Growing evidence has suggested that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) acts as a novel neuro-modulator and neuroprotective agent; however, it remains to be investigated whether H2S has a direct effect on neural stem cells (NSCs). We report here that NSCs expressed cystathionine β synthase (CBS) and addition of exogenous H2S donor, l-cysteine, stimulated proliferation and increased the differentiation potential of NSCs to neurons and astroglia. Moreover, pre-treatment with aminooxyacetic acid, the inhibitor of CBS or knockdown of CBS in using siRNA, significantly attenuated the effects of l-cysteine on elevated H2S levels and the cell proliferation; it also effectively suppressed l-cysteine-induced neurogenesis and astrocytogenesis. Further analysis revealed that l-cysteine-induced proliferation was associated with phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 and differentiation with altered expression of differentiation-related genes. Taken together, the present data suggest that l-cysteine can enhance proliferation and differentiation of NSCs via the CBS/H2S pathway, which may serve as a useful inference for elucidating its role in regulating the fate of NSCs in physiological and pathological settings.

AB  - Stress activates the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis leading to the release of glucocorticoids (GC). Increased activity of the HPA axis and GC exposure has been suggested to facilitate the development of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Nonetheless, different stressors can produce distinct effects on food intake and may support different directions of food learning e.g. avoidance or acceptance. This study examined whether interoceptive (LiCl and exendin-4) and restraint stress (RS) support similar or distinct food learning. Female rats were exposed to different stressors after their consumption of a palatable food (butter icing). After four palatable food–stress pairings, distinct intakes of the butter icing were observed in rats treated with different stressors. Rats that received butter icing followed by intraperitoneal injections of LiCl (42.3 mg/kg) and exendin-4 (10 μg/kg) completely avoided the palatable food with subsequent presentations. In contrast, rats experiencing RS paired with the palatable food increased their consumption of butter icing across trials and did so to a greater degree than rats receiving saline injections. These data indicate that interoceptive and psychosocial stressors support conditioned food avoidance and acceptance, respectively. Examination of c-Fos immunoreactivity revealed distinct neural activation by interoceptive and psychosocial stressors that could provide the neural basis underlying opposite direction of food acceptance learning.

AB  - Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) is a major depressive disorder that recurs in the fall and winter when day-length gets short. It is well accepted that day-length is encoded by the principal circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), but very little is known about day-length encoding in diurnal mammals. The present study utilized the grass rat, Arvicanthis niloticus, to investigate how the circadian system responds to photoperiodic changes in a diurnal mammal that shows day-length-dependent mood changes. The animals were initially housed in equatorial day-length (12 h, EP) followed by either long (16 h, LP) or short (8 h, SP) photoperiods. The LP animals showed an expansion of the peak phase of the PER1 and PER2 rhythm in the SCN as well as an extended behavioral active phase. In contrast, the SP animals did not show any compression of their active phase nor a change in the peak duration of PER1 or PER2 expression, compared to those in EP. The results suggest that the circadian system in the diurnal grass rats is less responsive when day-length gets short compared to when it gets longer. The depression-like behaviors were assessed using sweet solution preference (SSP) and forced swimming test (FST). Animals in the SP group showed decreased SSP and increased immobility time in FST as compared to the EP group, suggesting a depressive phenotype. The present study serves as the first step toward exploring the role that the circadian system plays in SAD using a diurnal rodent model.

AB  - Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a botanical compound abundant in honeybees’ propolis. It has anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antioxidant, immunomodulatory and antitumor properties. Its beneficial effects against neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease, have also been suggested and some mechanisms have been proposed. Mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress are critical events in neurodegeneration. Release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol and the downstream activation of caspase-3 have been suggested as targets of the protective mechanism of CAPE. Most of the studies addressing the protective effect of CAPE have been performed in cell culture. This is the first study to demonstrate the protective effect of CAPE against the dopaminergic neuronal loss induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in rats. It also demonstrates, for the first time, the inhibitory effect of CAPE on mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), a mediator of neuronal death that triggers cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation. Scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and metal chelation was demonstrated in the brain-affected areas of the rats treated with 6-OHDA and CAPE. Additionally, we demonstrated that CAPE does not affect brain mitochondrial function. Based on these findings and on its ability to cross the blood–brain barrier, CAPE is a promising compound to treat Parkinson’s and other neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - The present study was designed to determine the role of the kynurenine pathway (KP) in the mechanism of action of valproate (VPA). Therefore, we investigated changes in the concentrations of tryptophan (TRP), kynurenic acid (KYNA), and kynurenine (KYN) in the brain and plasma following VPA administration (50, 250 and 500 mg/kg i.p.). The most important findings of our study were that VPA administration produced a progressive and strong increase in the central concentrations of KYNA, KYN and TRP. Simultaneously, the TRP level in plasma declined, while the peripheral increase of KYNA in plasma was weaker and occurred earlier than in the hippocampus. Bearing in mind that the observed effect may be a result of a strong VPA-induced displacement of TRP from its binding sites to plasma albumin, we checked the effect of ibuprofen (IBU) administration (a prototypic drug used to study drug binding to serum albumin) on the KP. We found that IBU evoked a similar pattern of change in the KP activity as VPA.

These new findings indicate the existence of a mechanism that could stimulate the production of KYNA in the brain after VPA administration, and may partially contribute to the mechanisms of VPA action. The results of our experiment indicate that an increase in the brain’s KYNA level may be achieved by TRP displacement from its binding site on plasma albumin with the administration of different drugs, including VPA, IBU, or short-chain fatty acids, with important clinical consequences.

AB  - In addition to GABA and glutamate innervations, the globus pallidus (GP) receives dopamine afferents from the pars compacta of the substantia nigra (SNc), and in turn, sends inhibitory GABAergic efferents to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra (SNr). Nevertheless, the role of dopamine in the modulation of these pallido-subthalamic and pallido-nigral projections is not known. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of intrapallidal injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) on the electrical activity of STN and SNr neurons using in vivo extracellular single unit recordings in the rat and on motor behaviors, using the “open field” actimeter and the stepping test. We show that intrapallidal injection of 6-OHDA significantly decreased locomotor activity and contralateral paw use. Electrophysiological recordings show that 6-OHDA injection into GP significantly increased the number of bursty cells in the STN without changing the firing rate, while in the SNr neuronal firing rate decreased and the proportion of irregular cells increased. Our data provide evidence that intrapallidal injection of 6-OHDA resulted in motor deficits paralleled by changes in the firing activity of STN and SNr neurons, which mimic in large part those obtained after major dopamine depletion in the classical rat model of Parkinson’s disease. They support the assumption that in addition to its action in the striatum, dopamine mediates its regulatory function at various levels of the basal ganglia circuitry, including the GP.

In a total of 164 healthy volunteers volumetric measures of the OBs were performed plus lateralized measurements of odor thresholds and odor discrimination. Side differences were defined as 10% difference between the left and right OB. In 39 cases volumes on the right side were larger than on the left side, whereas in 29 cases it was the other way around. Subjects with larger right-sided OB volumes were found to be more sensitive to odorous stimulation of the right as compared to the left nostril in terms of odor thresholds and odor detection; higher sensitivity of the left nostrils (decreased odor threshold) was observed in individuals with larger OB volumes on the left side. These data appear to suggest that OB volume may be partly dependent on lateralized influences on the olfactory system, reflecting its lateralized organization.

AB  - In this paper, we investigated event-related potentials (ERPs) evoked by visual stimuli with different three-dimensional visual depths. Before the experiment, tests for binocular advantage and for sensitivity to three-dimensional depth were carried out, respectively. At the same time, it should be ensured that the distinguishing degree of different depths is big enough. After the qualified participants were selected, pictures with five different three-dimensional depths were presented to the participants who were asked to give a judgment of the depths. The behavioral results showed that under the five different depths, the participants had a very high accuracy of judgment. ERP results showed that in the time windows of 90–130 ms and 150–200 ms after the onset of visual target stimuli, P1 and N2 components appeared in the area from parietal to occipital regions. It was interesting that there existed a positive correlation between the amplitude of the N2 component and the absolute value of the depth. Meanwhile, time–frequency analysis results showed that, in the time window of 150–200 ms after the onset of visual target stimuli, a similar positive correlation between the time–frequency distribution and the absolute value of the depth was also found. Additionally, in the time window of 200–600 ms after the onset of visual target stimuli, the alpha waves evoked under the five different depths were almost the same, which reflected that the cognitive process of three-dimensional visual depth might be finished by 200 ms after the onset of visual target stimuli, when the brain is in a state of relaxation.

AB  - In response to low ambient oxygen levels the western painted turtle brain undergoes a large depression in metabolic rate which includes a decrease in neuronal action potential frequency. This involves the arrest of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor (AMPAR) currents and paradoxically an increase in γ-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAR) currents in turtle cortical neurons. In a search for other oxygen-sensitive channels we discovered a Ca2+-activated K+ channel (KCa) that exhibited a decrease in open time in response to anoxia. Single-channel recordings of KCa activity were obtained in cell-attached and excised inside-out patch configurations from neurons in cortical brain sheets bathed in either normoxic or anoxic artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). The channel has a slope conductance of 223 pS, is activated in response to membrane depolarization, and is controlled in a reversible manner by free [Ca2+] at the intracellular membrane surface. In the excised patch configuration anoxia had no effect on KCa channel open probability (Popen); however, in cell-attached mode, there was a reversible fivefold reduction in Popen (from 0.5 ± 0.05 to 0.1 ± 0.03) in response to 30-min anoxia. The inclusion of the potent protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine prevented the anoxia-mediated decrease in Popen while drip application of a phorbol ester PKC activator decreased Popen during normoxia (from normoxic 0.4 ± 0.05 to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) 0.1 ± 0.02). Anoxia results in a slight depolarization of turtle pyramidal neurons (∼8 mV) and an increase in cytosolic [Ca2+]; therefore, KCa arrest is likely important to prevent Ca2+ activation during anoxia and to reduce the energetic cost of maintaining ion gradients. We conclude that turtle pyramidal cell Ca2+-activated K+ channels are oxygen-sensitive channels regulated by cytosolic factors and are likely the reptilian analog of the mammalian large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (BK channels).

AB  - Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was investigated in the present study to examine whether it could affect the activation status of microglia under microenvironment of spinal cord injury and provide a potential therapeutic treatment for spinal cord injury. We established mouse spinal cord hemisection model and injected recombinant human G-CSF (rhG-CSF) subcutaneously. The results demonstrated that G-CSF could recruit microglia to the injury site in the first 72 h after spinal cord injury. Moreover, G-CSF inhibits the expression of pro-inflammatory factors and promotes the expression of neurotrophic factors. Additionally, G-CSF also increases the expression of markers of M2 macrophage and inhibits the expression of markers of M1 macrophage in BV2 microglia in vitro model, favoring the M2 polarization of microglia under the microenvironment of spinal cord hemisection. NFκB signal pathway was involved in G-CSF-induced polarization of BV2 microglia. As a conclusion, we suggested that administration of G-CSF within the first 72 h after spinal cord injury might reduce early inflammation-induced detrimental effect and promote an anti-inflammatory response that favors repair via improving alternative activation of microglia. Administration of G-CSF in the acute phase of spinal cord injury may be a promising strategy in restorative therapy after spinal cord injury.

AB  - Akinesia and rigidity are cardinal symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Previous studies analysing event-related desynchronization during movement onset associated both symptoms with pathologically increased oscillations in the beta frequency range. By focusing on the movement onset only, these studies cannot, however, shed light onto the question how oscillatory activity is changed during continuous movements.

To investigate this issue, we compared the power of the local field potentials (LFP) within and above the subthalamic nucleus (STN) during rest, an isometric hold condition of the forearm, and a fist flexion and extension task in 13 patients with idiopathic PD during implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes.

During fist flexion and extension (relative to rest), significantly increased activity in the low beta (12–18 Hz) and gamma (30–48 Hz) frequency ranges was observed within the STN, while during hold (compared to rest) no significant difference was found. For the regions above the STN the power during fist movements (compared to rest) was significantly higher, i.e. in the range of 18–30 Hz, with no significant changes in the gamma frequency range.

Beta activity is claimed to inhibit movement and thereby could render fist movements more exhausting. Therefore, the observed increase in beta activity in the STN during fist movements might result in bradykinesia as experienced by many patients. We hypothesise that in order to enable repetitive fist movement despite increased beta activity, “prokinetic” gamma activity may be increased as a compensatory mechanism.

AB  - The Cdh23erl/erl mice are a novel mouse model for DFNB12 and are characterized by progressive hearing loss. In this study, erythropoietin (EPO) was given to the Cdh23erl/erl mice by intraperitoneal injection every other day from P7 for 7 weeks. Phosphate-buffered saline-treated or untreated Cdh23erl/erl mice were used as controls. Auditory-evoked brainstem response (ABR) thresholds and distortion product oto-acoustic emission (DPOAE) were measured in the mouse groups at the age of 4, 6 and 8 weeks. The results show that EPO can significantly decrease the ABR thresholds in the Cdh23erl/erl mice as compared with those of the untreated mice at stimulus frequencies of click, 8-, 16- and 32-kHz at three time points. Meanwhile, DPOAE amplitudes in the EPO-treated Cdh23erl/erl mouse group were significantly higher than those of the untreated groups at f2 frequency of 15383 Hz at the three time points. Furthermore, the mean percentage of outer hair cell loss at middle through basal turns of cochleae was significantly lower in EPO-treated Cdh23erl/erl mice than in the untreated mice (P &lt; 0.05). This is the first report that EPO acts as an otoprotectant in a DFNB12 mouse model with progressive hearing loss.

AB  - Abstract
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ and PPARα have shown neuroprotective effects in models of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The role of the third, more ubiquitous isoform PPARδ has not been fully explored. This study investigated the role of PPARδ in PD using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to model the dopaminergic neurodegeneration of PD. In vitro administration of the PPARδ antagonist GSK0660 (1 μM) increased the detrimental effect of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP+) on cell viability, which was reversed by co-treatment with agonist GW0742 (1 μM). GW0742 alone did not affect MPP+ toxicity. PPARδ was expressed in the nucleus of dopaminergic neurons and in astrocytes. Striatal PPARδ levels were increased (over two-fold) immediately after MPTP treatment (30 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days) compared to saline-treated mice. PPARδ heterozygous mice were not protected against MPTP toxicity. Intra-striatal infusion of GW0742 (84 μg/day) reduced the MPTP-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons (5036 ± 195) when compared to vehicle-infused mice (3953 ± 460). These results indicate that agonism of PPARδ provides protection against MPTP toxicity, in agreement with the effects of other PPAR agonists.

AB  - Adverse early life experience is thought to increase an individual’s susceptibility to mental health disorders, including anxiety and affective disorders, later in life. Our previous studies have shown that post-weaning social isolation of female rats during a critical period of development sensitizes an anxiety-related serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) system in adulthood. Therefore, we investigated how post-weaning social isolation, in combination with a challenge with the anxiogenic drug, N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG-7142; a partial inverse agonist at the benzodiazepine allosteric site on the GABAA receptor), affects home cage behavior and serotonergic gene expression in the DR of female rats using in situ hybridization histochemistry. Juvenile female rats were reared in isolation or groups of three for a 3-week period from weaning (postnatal day (PD) 21 to mid-adolescence (PD42)), after which all rats were group-reared for an additional 16 days until adulthood. Among vehicle-treated rats, isolation-reared rats had decreased rodent tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (tph2) mRNA expression in ventral and ventrolateral subdivisions of the DR, a pattern observed previously in a rat model of panic disorder. Isolation-reared rats, but not group-reared rats, responded to FG-7142 with increased duration of vigilance and arousal behaviors. In addition, FG-7142 decreased tph2 expression, measured 4 h following treatment, in multiple subregions of the DR of group-reared rats but had no effect in isolation-reared rats. No treatment effects were observed on 5-HT1A receptor or serotonin transporter gene expression. These data suggest that adolescent social isolation alters tph2 expression in specific subregions of the DR and alters the effects of stress-related stimuli on behavior and serotonergic systems.

AB  - The predominant motor symptom in Huntington’s disease (HD) is chorea. The patho-anatomical basis for the chorea is not well known, but a link with the dopaminergic system has been suggested by post-mortem and clinical studies. Our previous work revealed an increased number of dopamine-containing cells in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area in a transgenic rat model of HD (tgHD). Since there were no changes in the total number of cells in those regions, we hypothesized that changes in cell phenotype were taking place. Here, we tested this hypothesis by studying the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), which houses dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic (mainly serotonergic) neurons in tgHD rat tissue and postmortem HD human tissue. We found an increased number of dopamine and reduced number of serotonin-containing cells in the DRN of tgHD rats. Similar findings in postmortem HD brain tissue indicate that these changes also occur in patients. Further investigations in the tgHD animal tissue revealed the presence of dopaminergic cell bodies in the B6 raphe region, while in control animals exclusively serotonin-containing cells were found. These data suggest the existence of phenotype changes in monoaminergic neurons in the DRN in HD and shed new light on the neurobiology of clinical neurological symptoms such as chorea and mood changes.

AB  - Although mitochondrial dysfunction is intimately related to axonal degeneration following nerve injury, the molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial swelling and its mechanistic relation to axonal degeneration are largely unknown. Previous studies have demonstrated that axonal degeneration in the injured peripheral nerves shows two morphologically distinct phases: (1) A latency period (∼24 h), in which the morphology of axonal cytoskeletons seems unchanged, followed by (2) an execution period (36–48 h), which shows a catastrophic granular degeneration of most axonal structures in rodent axons. In the present study, we found that, in the sciatic nerve axotomy model, energy failure and microtubule depolymerization occurred during the latency period whereas mitochondrial swelling and neurofilament degradation started in the execution period. The energy repletion with NAD or an NAD/pyruvate mixture inhibited microtubule depolymerization, mitochondrial swelling and axonal degeneration in transected sciatic nerve axons. In addition, microtubule perturbing agents enhanced axonal degeneration and mitochondrial swelling. Extracellular calcium chelation did not affect energy failure, microtubule depolymerization or mitochondrial swelling, but it did prevent neurofilament degradation. These findings suggest that an early disturbance in energy dynamics regardless of mitochondrial swelling might be a key trigger for the initiation of axonal degeneration and that extracellular calcium influx is a late effector for neurofilament degradation.

AB  - Identification of markers of enteric neurons has contributed substantially to our understanding of the development, normal physiology, and pathology of the gut. Previously identified markers of the enteric nervous system can be used to label all or most neuronal structures or for examining individual cells by labeling just the nucleus or cell body. Most of these markers are excellent but have some limitations. Transmembrane protein 100 (TMEM100) is a gene at locus 17q32 encoding a 134-amino acid protein with two hypothetical transmembrane domains. TMEM100 expression has not been reported in adult mammalian tissues but does appear in the ventral neural tube of embryonic mice and plays a role in signaling pathways associated with development of the enteric nervous system. We showed that TMEM100 messenger RNA is expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and demonstrated that TMEM100 is a membrane-associated protein. Furthermore TMEM100 immunoreactivity was restricted to enteric neurons and vascular tissue in the muscularis propria of all regions of the mouse and human gastrointestinal tract. TMEM100 immunoreactivity colocalized with labeling for the pan-neuronal marker protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5) but not with the glial marker S100ß or Kit, a marker of interstitial cells of Cajal. The signaling molecule, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 4, was also expressed in enteric neurons of the human colon and co-localized with TMEM100. TMEM100 is also expressed in neuronal cell bodies and fibers in the mouse brain and dorsal root ganglia. We conclude that TMEM100 is a novel, membrane-associated marker for enteric nerves and is as effective as PGP9.5 for identifying neuronal structures in the gastrointestinal tract. The expression of TMEM100 in the enteric nervous system may reflect a role in the development and differentiation of cells through a transforming growth factor β, BMP or related signaling pathway.

AB  - The function of the sigma-1 receptor (S1R) has been implicated in modulating the activity of various ion channels. In the CNS S1R is enriched in cholinergic postsynaptic densities in spinal cord motoneurons (MNs). Mutations in S1R have been found in familial cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

In this study we show that a knockout of S1R in the SOD1*G93A mouse model of ALS significantly reduces longevity (end stage). Electrophysiological experiments demonstrate that MN of mice lacking S1R exhibit increased excitability. Taken together the data suggest the S1R acts as a brake on excitability, an effect that might enhance longevity in an ALS mouse model.

AB  - The present study examined the roles of ventrolateral orbital cortex (VLO) 5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptor subtypes in mediating 5-HT-induced antiallodynic actions in the rat spared nerve injury (SNI) pain model. Changes in paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) were measured using von-Frey filaments. Microinjection of 5-HT (2, 5 and 10 μg, in 0.5 μl) into the VLO depressed allodynia induced by SNI, and the PWT increased in a dose-dependent manner. Microinjection of selective 5-HT1A, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5A, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptor antagonists, 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimido)butyl] piperazine hydrobromide (NAN-190) (10 μg), cyproheptadine (50 ng), granisetron hydrochloride (granisetron) (10 μg), 1-[2-[(methylsulfonyl)-amino]ethyl]-4-piperidinyl]methyl1-methyl-1H-indole-3-carboxylate (GR113808) (5 μg), SB699551 dihydrochloride (SB699551) (10 μg), SB258585 dihydrochloride (SB258585) (2 μg) or SB269970 hydrochloride (SB269970) (10 μg) into the VLO 5-min prior to 5-HT (10 μg) injection, all antagonized the 5-HT-induced inhibition of allodynia. In addition, these antagonists applied alone to VLO did not influence allodynia. These results suggest that although 5-HT1–7 receptor subtypes in the VLO do not have a tonic modulatory action on the allodynia induced by SNI, they are involved in mediating the depression of the SNI allodynia produced by injection of 5HT into VLO.

AB  - Neurons in the primary visual cortex are often classified as either simple or complex based on the linearity (or otherwise) of their response to spatial luminance contrast. In practice, classification is typically based on Fourier analysis of a cell’s response to an optimal drifting sine-wave grating. Simple cells are generally considered to be linear and produce responses modulated at the fundamental frequency of the stimulus grating. In contrast, complex cells exhibit significant nonlinearities that reduce the response at the fundamental frequency. Cells can therefore be easily and objectively classified based on the relative modulation of their responses – the ratio of the phase-sensitive response at the fundamental frequency of the stimulus (F1) to the phase-invariant sustained response (F0). Cells are classified as simple if F1/F0 &gt; 1 and complex if F1/F0 &lt; 1. This classification is broadly consistent with criteria based on the spatial organisation of cells’ receptive fields and is accordingly presumed to reflect disparate functional roles of simple and complex cells in coding visual information. However, Fourier analysis of spiking responses is sensitive to the number of spikes available – F1/F0 increases as the number of spikes is reduced, even for phase-invariant complex cells. Moreover, many complex cells encountered in the laboratory exhibit some phase sensitivity, evident as modulation of their responses at the fundamental frequency. There currently exists no objective quantitative means of assessing the significance or otherwise of these modulations. Here we derive a statistical basis for objectively assessing whether the modulation of neuronal responses is reliable, thereby adding a level of statistical certainty to measures of phase sensitivity. We apply our statistical analysis to neuronal responses to moving sine-wave gratings recorded from 367 cells in cat primary visual cortex. We find that approximately 60% of complex cells exhibit statistically significant (α &lt; 0.01) modulation of their responses to optimal moving gratings. These complex cells are phase sensitive and reliably encode spatial phase.

AB  - Estrogen receptors (ERs) play important roles in estrogen-mediated neuroprotection. However, their effects on blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption with vasogenic edema after ischemic stroke have not been determined. We evaluated a role for ERβ in the brain without effects in the peripheral reproductive organs for the amelioration of vasogenic edema following ischemic stroke. Transient focal ischemic stroke was induced in ovariectomized female C57BL/6 mice (age 10–11 weeks) that were treated with the ERβ-selective agonist diarylpropionitrile (DPN). BBB breakdown as determined by the extravasation of endogenous immunoglobulin G (IgG), vasogenic edema, and the infarct volume was significantly reduced by DPN compared to vehicle. Protein expressions of endothelial tight junction proteins (occludin and claudin-5) and the water channel protein aquaporin 4 in the ischemic cortex were not changed by DPN. However, protein levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), a transcription factor that increases VEGF expression, were significantly decreased in the ischemic cortex by DPN. These results suggest that ERβ contributes to the reduction of vasogenic edema caused by BBB breakdown via the inhibition of HIF-1α and VEGF following ischemic stroke.

AB  - Levels of kynurenic acid (KYNA), an endogenous α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) antagonist, are elevated in the brain of patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and might contribute to the pathophysiology and cognitive deficits seen in the disorder. As developmental vulnerabilities contribute to the etiology of SZ, we determined, in rats, the effects of perinatal increases in KYNA on brain chemistry and cognitive flexibility. KYNA’s bioprecursor l-kynurenine (100 mg/day) was fed to dams from gestational day 15 to postnatal day 21 (PD21). Offspring were then given regular chow until adulthood. Control rats received unadulterated mash. Brain tissue levels of KYNA were measured at PD2 and PD21, and extracellular levels of KYNA and glutamate were determined by microdialysis in the prefrontal cortex in adulthood (PD56–80). In other adult rats, the effects of perinatal l-kynurenine administration on cognitive flexibility were assessed using an attentional set-shifting task. l-Kynurenine treatment raised forebrain KYNA levels ∼3-fold at PD2 and ∼2.5-fold at PD21. At PD56–80, extracellular prefrontal KYNA levels were moderately but significantly elevated (+12%), whereas extracellular glutamate levels were not different from controls. Set-shifting was selectively impaired by perinatal exposure to l-kynurenine, as treated rats acquired the discrimination and intra-dimensional shift at the same rate as controls, yet exhibited marked deficits in the initial reversal and extra-dimensional shift. Acute administration of the α7nAChR-positive modulator galantamine (3.0 mg/kg, i.p.) restored performance to control levels. These results validate early developmental exposure to l-kynurenine as a novel, naturalistic animal model for studying cognitive deficits in SZ.

AB  - Background
Recent studies suggest that normobaric hyperoxia (HO) reduces hypoxia-reoxygenation injury in the rat brain. We have attempted to determine the effect of HO on Na+–Ca2+ exchangers (NCX) in the rat stroke model.
Methods
Rats were divided into two experimental groups. The first group was exposed to 95% inspired HO for 4 h/day for 6 consecutive days (HO). The second group acted as the control, and was exposed to 21% oxygen in the same chamber. Each main group was subdivided to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO-operated) and intact (without any surgery) subgroups. After 48 h from pretreatment, MCAO-operated subgroups were subjected to 60 min of right MCAO. After 24 h reperfusion, neurologic deficit score (NDS) and infarct volume were measured in MCAO-operated subgroups. The NCXs expression levels of the core, penumbra and subcortical regions were assessed in sham-operated and intact subgroups.
Result
Preconditioning with HO decreased NDS and infarct volume, and increased the expression of NCX1, NCX2 and NCX3 in the penumbra, NCX2, NCX3 in the core and NCX1 and NCX3 in the subcortex.
Conclusion
Although further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms of ischemic tolerance, HO partly is associated with the expression of NCX1, 2, 3 consistent with an active role in the genesis of ischemic protection.

AB  - The transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a member of the Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase family, is characterized as a key regulator in inflammatory and apoptosis signaling pathways. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of the TAK1 pathway in experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI) in rats. Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were subjected to TBI using a modified Feeney’s weight-drop model. The time course showed that a significant increase of TAK1 and p-TAK1 expression in the cortex after TBI. Moreover, TBI induced TAK1 redistribution both in neurons and astrocytes of the lesion boundary zone. The effects of specific inhibition of the TAK1 pathway by 5Z-7-oxozeaenol (OZ, intracerebroventricular injection at 10 min post-trauma) on histopathological and behavioral outcomes in rats were assessed at 24 h post injury. The number of TUNEL-positive stained cells was diminished and neuronal survival and neurological function were improved with OZ treatment. Biochemically, the high dose of OZ significantly reduced the levels of TAK1 and p-TAK1, further decreased nuclear factor-κB and activator protein 1 activities and the release of inflammatory cytokines. In addition, we found that both 10 min and 3 h post-trauma OZ therapies could markedly improve neurological function and neuronal survival after long-term survival. These results revealed that the TAK1 pathway is activated after experimental TBI and the inhibitor OZ affords significant neuro- protection and amelioration of neurobehavioral deficits after experimental TBI, suggesting a potential rationale for manipulating this pathway in clinical practice.

AB  - The estrogen induction of progesterone receptors (PRs) in the ventrolateral division of the hypothalamic ventromedial nucleus (VMNvl) is critical for the regulation of female sexual behavior. VMNvl neurons express PRs and both types of estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ), and their sequential activation initiates the molecular mechanisms underlying sexual behavior. To assess the relative importance of each ER subtype in the induction of PRs, we have estimated the total number of PR-immunoreactive neurons and quantified the total amount of PR protein in the VMNvl of adult ovariectomized rats that were injected with either estradiol benzoate (EB) or the specific agonists of the ERα, propyl-pyrazole triol (PPT), and of the ERβ, diaryl-propionitrile (DPN), in different doses and schedules. The administration of EB and of PPT alone, but not of DPN alone, increased the total number of PR-immunoreactive neurons and PR protein levels. When the specific agonists were administered sequentially, the total number of PR-immunoreactive neurons also increased, particularly when PPT was administered before DPN. Conversely, the concomitant administration of PPT and DPN did not increase the number of PR-immunoreactive neurons.

The observation that PPT increases the number of PR-immunoreactive neurons and the levels of PR protein far less than EB shows that the estradiol induction of PRs in the VMNvl does not involve solely the activation of the ERα and suggests that it might also implicate the activation of membrane receptors. The present results also show that ERβ activation averts the action of ERα in the induction of PRs.

AB  - The physiological effects of melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R) on metabolism have been hypothesized to be mediated individually or collectively by neuronal groups innervating the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH). The present study was designed to identify MC4-R-expressing neurons that innervate the PVH using retrograde tract tracing techniques in the MC4-R-GFP reporter mice. Our initial mapping identified very limited projections from MC4-R-expressing neurons to the PVH. This included a defined population of MC4-R-positive neurons located in the ventral premmamillary nucleus (PMv). Anterograde tracing experiments confirmed projections from PMv neurons to the medial parvicellular subdivision of the PVH, in close proximity to oxytocin neurons and β-endorphin-containing fibers. Given the known stimulatory effects of leptin and sexual odorants exposure on many PMv neurons, it was expected that MC4-R-expressing neurons in the PMv might be responsive to leptin and activated by odors exposure. Contrary to expectation, MC4-R-GFP neurons in the PMv do not respond to leptin as demonstrated by double labeling for GFP and leptin-induced phosphorylated STAT3. However, we found that Fos expression is induced in a large subset of MC4-R-GFP neurons in the PMv in response to opposite sex odors. Collectively, these results provide evidence for a previous unrecognized role of MC4-R expressed by neurons innervating the PVH that are also sensitive to reproductive cues.

AB  - Adult neurogenesis in mammals is typically observed in the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone. We investigated adult neurogenesis in the brain of a giant otter shrew (Potamogale velox), a semi-aquatic, central African rainforest mammal of the family Tenrecidae that belongs to the superorder Afrotheria. We examined neurogenesis immunohistochemically, using the endogenous marker doublecortin (DCX), which stains neuronal precursor cells and immature neurons. Our results revealed densely packed DCX-positive cells in the entire extent of the subventricular zone from where cells migrated along the rostral migratory stream to the olfactory bulb. In the olfactory bulb, DCX-expressing cells were primarily present in the granular cell layer with radially orientated dendrites and in the glomerular layer representing periglomerular cells. In the hippocampus, DCX-positive cells were identified in the subgranular and granular layers of the dentate gyrus and strongly labelled DCX-positive processes, presumably dendrites and axons of the newly generated granular cells, were observed in the CA3 regions. In addition, DCX immunoreactive cells were present in the olfactory tubercle, the piriform cortex and the endopiriform nucleus. While DCX-positive fibres have been previously observed in the anterior commissure of the hedgehog and mole, we were able to demonstrate the presence of DCX-positive cells presumably migrating across the anterior commissure. Taken together, the giant otter shrew reveals patterns of neurogenesis similar to that seen in other mammals; however, the appearance of possible neuronal precursor cells in the anterior commissure is a novel observation.

AB  - The parapyramidal (ppy) region targets primarily the intermediolateral cell column and is probably involved in breathing and thermoregulation. In the present study, we tested whether ppy serotonergic neurons respond to activation of central and peripheral chemoreceptors. Bulbospinal ppy neurons (n = 30) were recorded extracellularly along with the phrenic nerve activity in urethane/α-chloralose-anesthetized, paralyzed, intact (n = 7) or carotid body denervated (n = 6) male Wistar rats. In intact animals, most of the ppy neurons were inhibited by hypoxia (n = 14 of 19) (8% O2, 30 s) (1.5 ± 0.03 vs. control: 2.4 ± 0.2 Hz) or hypercapnia (n = 15 of 19) (10% CO2) (1.7 ± 0.1 vs. control: 2.2 ± 0.2 Hz), although some neurons were insensitive to hypoxia (n = 3 of 19) or hypercapnia (n = 4 of 19). Very few neurons (n = 2 of 19) were activated after hypoxia, but not after hypercapnia. In carotid body denervated rats, all the 5HT-ppy neurons (n = 11) were insensitive to hypercapnia (2.1 ± 0.1 vs. control: 2.3 ± 0.09 Hz). Biotinamide-labeled cells that were recovered after histochemistry were located in the ppy region. Most labeled cells (90%) showed strong tryptophan hydroxylase immunocytochemical reactivity, indicating that they were serotonergic. The present data reveal that peripheral chemoreceptors reduce the activity of the serotonergic premotor neurons located in the ppy region. It is plausible that the serotonergic neurons of the ppy region could conceivably regulate breathing automaticity and be involved in autonomic regulation.

AB  - Okadaic acid (OKA) is a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1/2A (PP2A). Inhibition of PP2A leads to hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein. Hyperphosphorylated Tau protein is present in intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles a characteristic feature of neuropathology of Alzheimer’s disease. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of OKA causes neurotoxicity, which is associated with increased intracellular Ca2+ level, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction in the brain areas. The present study explored Tau phosphorylation in OKA-treated rats in relation to memory function, PP2A activity, intracellular Ca2+, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor after 13 days of OKA (200 ng, ICV) administration in rats, memory was found impaired in the water maze test. OKA-induced memory-impaired rats showed increased mRNA and protein expression of Tau, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), Calpain and GSK3β in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. On the other hand, mRNA expression and activity of PP2A was reduced in these brain areas. OKA treatment also, resulted in decrease in mRNA expression of C and N terminals of Tau. Treatment with NMDA antagonist, MK801 (0.05 mg/kg, i.p.) for 13 days significantly prevented OKA-induced changes in the expression of PP2A, Tau, GSK3β, CaMKII and Calpain. Further, daily administration of anticholinergic drug, donepezil (5 mg/kg, p.o.), and the NMDA receptor antagonist, memantine (10 mg/kg, p.o.) initiated after OKA administration for 13 days significantly attenuated OKA-induced variation in Tau, Tau-C terminal, Tau-N terminal CaMKII, Calpain, PP2A and GSK3β. These results infer that NMDA antagonist MK801 and memantine are effective against OKA-induced neurotoxicity. Therefore, the present study clearly indicates the involvement of NMDA receptor in OKA (ICV)-induced Tau hyperphosphorylation.

AB  - Motivation has been demonstrated to affect individuals’ response strategies in economic decision-making, however, little is known about how motivation influences perceptual decision-making behavior or its related neural activity. Given the important role motivation plays in shaping our behavior, a better understanding of this relationship is needed.

A block-design, continuous performance, perceptual decision-making task where participants were asked to detect a picture of an animal among distractors was used during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The effect of positive and negative motivation on sustained activity within regions of the brain thought to underlie decision-making was examined by altering the monetary contingency associated with the task. In addition, signal detection theory was used to investigate the effect of motivation on detection sensitivity, response bias and response time.

While both positive and negative motivation resulted in increased sustained activation in the ventral striatum, fusiform gyrus, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, only negative motivation resulted in the adoption of a more liberal, closer to optimal response bias. This shift toward a liberal response bias correlated with increased activation in the left DLPFC, but did not result in improved task performance.

The present findings suggest that motivation alters aspects of the way perceptual decisions are made. Further, this altered response behavior is reflected in a change in left DLPFC activation, a region involved in the computation of perceptual decisions.

AB  - We previously demonstrated that the peptidergic neurotransmitter pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) affects the autonomic system and contributes to the control of metabolic and cardiovascular functions. Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of centrally-mediated sympathetic effects of leptin for obesity-related hypertension. Here we tested whether PACAP signaling in the brain is implicated in leptin-induced sympathetic excitation and appetite suppression. In anesthetized mice, intracerebroventricular (ICV) pre-treatment with PACAP6-38, an antagonist of the PACAP receptors (PAC1-R and VPAC2), inhibited the increase in white adipose tissue sympathetic nerve activity (WAT-SNA) produced by ICV leptin (2 μg). In contrast, leptin-induced stimulation of renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) was not affected by ICV pre-treatment with PACAP6-38. Moreover, in PACAP-deficient (Adcyap1−/−) mice, ICV leptin-induced WAT-SNA increase was impaired, whereas RSNA response was preserved. The reductions in food intake and body weight evoked by ICV leptin were attenuated in Adcyap1−/− mice. Our data suggest that hypothalamic PACAP signaling plays a key role in the control by leptin of feeding behavior and lipocatabolic sympathetic outflow, but spares the renal sympathetic traffic.

AB  - The hematopoietic growth factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), has become one of the few growth factors approved for clinical use. It has therapeutic potential for numerous neurodegenerative diseases; however, at present the cellular effects of G-CSF on the central nervous system remain unclear and in need of investigation. In the present study, we used spinal cord ischemia, a neurodegenerative model, to examine the effects of intrathecal (i.t.) G-CSF on glial cell (microglia and astrocyte) activation and neuroprotective factor expression, including glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) protein expression. Our results indicate that i.t. G-CSF could enhance ischemia-induced microglial activation and inhibit ischemia-induced astrocyte activation. Both GDNF and VEGF-A are upregulated after injury, and i.t. G-CSF could enhance GDNF and VEGF-A expressions after injury. Interestingly, our results indicate that performing i.t. G-CSF alone on normal animals could have the effect of microglial and astrocyte activation and enhanced GDNF and VEGF-A expressions. Furthermore, through laser scanning confocal microscopy, we found that astrocytes may contribute to the majority of GDNF and VEGF-A expressions of G-CSF after spinal cord ischemia. Overall, this G-CSF-induced upregulation suggests that activation of endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms could resist neurodegenerative insults. These observations demonstrate the cellular mechanism of i.t. G-CSF after spinal cord ischemia and confirm the neuroprotective effect of G-CSF after spinal cord ischemia injury.

AB  - Abstract
Nerve growth factor (NGF) is an important mediator in the initiation of the inflammatory response and NGF via activation of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) and downstream sphingomyelin signaling leads to significant enhancement of the excitability of small-diameter sensory neurons. Because of the interaction between sphingomyelin and cholesterol in creating membrane liquid-ordered domains known as membrane or lipid rafts, we examined whether neuronal NGF-induced sensitization via p75NTR was dependent on the integrity of membrane rafts. Here, we demonstrate that the capacity of NGF to enhance the excitability of sensory neurons may result from the interaction of p75NTR with its downstream signaling partner(s) in membrane rafts. Two agents known to disrupt membrane rafts, edelfosine and methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), block the increase in excitability produced by NGF. In contrast, treatment with MβCD containing saturated amounts of cholesterol does not alter the capacity of NGF to augment excitability. In addition, adding back MβCD with cholesterol restored the NGF-induced sensitization in previously cholesterol-depleted neurons, suggesting that cholesterol and the structural integrity of rafts are key to promoting NGF-mediated sensitization. Using established protocols to isolate detergent-resistant membranes, both p75NTR and the neuronal membrane raft marker, flotillin, localize to raft fractions. These results suggest that downstream signaling partners interacting with p75NTR in sensory neurons are associated with membrane raft signaling platforms.

AB  - Abstract
Gamma oscillations have long been considered to emerge late in development. However, recent studies have revealed that gamma oscillations are transiently expressed in the rat barrel cortex during the first postnatal week, a “critical” period of sensory-dependent barrel map formation. The mechanisms underlying the generation and physiological roles of early gamma oscillations (EGOs) in the development of thalamocortical circuits will be discussed in this review. In contrast to adult gamma oscillations, synchronized through gamma-rhythmic perisomatic inhibition, EGOs are primarily driven through feedforward gamma-rhythmic excitatory input from the thalamus. The recruitment of cortical interneurons to EGOs and the emergence of feedforward inhibition are observed by the end of the first postnatal week. EGOs facilitate the precise synchronization of topographically aligned thalamic and cortical neurons. The multiple replay of sensory input during EGOs supports long-term potentiation at thalamocortical synapses. We suggest that this early form of gamma oscillations, which is mechanistically different from adult gamma oscillations, guides barrel map formation during the critical developmental period.

AB  - Abstract
In young individuals, caffeine-mediated blockade of adenosine receptors and vasoconstriction has direct repercussions on task-related activations, changes in functional connectivity, as well as global vascular effects. To date, no study has explored the effect of caffeine on brain activation patterns during highly demanding cognitive tasks in the elderly.

This prospective, placebo-controlled crossover design comprises 24 healthy elderly individuals (mean age 68.8 ± 4.0 years, 17 females) performing a 2-back working memory (WM) task in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Analyses include complimentary assessment of task-related activations (general linear model, GLM), functional connectivity (tensorial independent component analysis, TICA), and baseline perfusion (arterial spin labeling).

Despite a reduction in whole-brain global perfusion (−22.7%), caffeine-enhanced task-related GLM activation in a local and distributed network is most pronounced in the bilateral striatum and to a lesser degree in the right middle and inferior frontal gyrus, bilateral insula, left superior and inferior parietal lobule as well as in the cerebellum bilaterally. TICA was significantly enhanced (+8.2%) in caffeine versus placebo in a distributed and task-relevant network including the pre-frontal cortex, the supplementary motor area, the ventral premotor cortex and the parietal cortex as well as the occipital cortex (visual stimuli) and basal ganglia. The inverse comparison of placebo versus caffeine had no significant difference. Activation strength of the task-relevant-network component correlated with response accuracy for caffeine yet not for placebo, indicating a selective cognitive effect of caffeine.

The present findings suggest that acute caffeine intake enhances WM-related brain activation as well as functional connectivity of blood oxygen level-dependent fMRI in elderly individuals.

AB  - Abstract
In the adult CNS, tissue-specific germinal niches, such as the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles and the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, contain multipotent neural precursor cells (NPCs) with the capacity to self-renew and differentiate into functional brain cells (i.e. neurons, astrocytes or oligodendrocytes). Due to their intrinsic plasticity, NPCs can be considered an essential part of the cellular mechanism(s) by which the CNS tries to repair itself after an injury. In inflammatory CNS disorders, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), neurogenesis and gliogenesis occur as part of an ‘intrinsic’ self-repair process. However, full and long-lasting repair in progressive MS is not achieved.

Recent data suggest that endogenous NPCs, while trying to repair the damaged CNS in MS, may become the target of the disease itself. It is possible that factors produced during MS, like CNS-infiltrating blood-borne inflammatory mononuclear cells, reactive CNS-resident cells, and humoral mediators, can alter the physiological properties of NPCs, ultimately impairing their ability to promote neural regeneration.

Here, we investigate the effect of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) derived from primary progressive (PPMS) and secondary progressive (SPMS) MS patients (CSF–MS) on the survival, proliferation, and differentiation of commercially available human embryonic-derived NPCs named ENStem-A. We found that PPMS derived CSF markedly reduced the proliferation of ENStem-A and increased their differentiation toward neuronal and oligodendroglial cells, compared to control CSF. Similar but less striking results were seen when ENstem-A were treated with SPMS derived CSF. Our findings suggest that in both SPMS and PPMS the CNS milieu, as determined by extrapolation from CSF findings, may stimulate the endogenous pool of NPCs to differentiate into neurons and oligodendrocytes.

AB  - Abstract
Neuroendocrine secretion often requires prolonged voltage-gated Ca2+ entry; however, the ability of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, such as endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria, to elicit secretion is less clear. We examined this using the bag cell neurons, which trigger ovulation in Aplysia by releasing egg-laying hormone (ELH) peptide. Secretion from cultured bag cell neurons was observed as an increase in plasma membrane capacitance following Ca2+ influx evoked by a 5-Hz, 1-min train of depolarizing steps under voltage-clamp. The response was similar for step durations of ⩾50 ms, but fell off sharply with shorter stimuli. The capacitance change was attenuated by replacing external Ca2+ with Ba2+, blocking Ca2+ channels, buffering intracellular Ca2+ with EGTA, disrupting synaptic protein recycling, or genetic knock-down of ELH. Regarding intracellular stores, liberating mitochondrial Ca2+ with the protonophore, carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-hydrazone (FCCP), brought about an EGTA-sensitive elevation of capacitance. Conversely, no change was observed to Ca2+ released from the endoplasmic reticulum or acidic stores. Prior exposure to FCCP lessened the train-induced capacitance increase, suggesting overlap in the pool of releasable vesicles. Employing GTP-γ-S to interfere with endocytosis delayed recovery (presumed membrane retrieval) of the capacitance change following FCCP, but not the train. Finally, secretion was correlated with reproductive behavior, in that neurons isolated from animals engaged in egg-laying presented a greater train-induced capacitance elevation vs quiescent animals. The bag cell neuron capacitance increase is consistent with peptide secretion requiring high Ca2+, either from influx or stores, and may reflect the all-or-none nature of reproduction.

AB  - Abstract
Blood–brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is a feature of many neurodegenerative disorders. The mechanisms and interactions between astrocytes, extracellular matrix and vascular endothelial cells in regulating the mature BBB are poorly understood. We have previously shown that transitory glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-astrocyte loss, induced by the systemic administration of 3-chloropropanediol, leads to reversible disruption of tight junction complexes and BBB integrity to a range of markers. However, early restoration of BBB integrity to dextran (10–70 kDa) and fibrinogen was seen in the absence of paracellular tight junction proteins claudin-5 and occludin. In the present study we show that in the GFAP-astrocyte-lesioned rat inferior colliculus, paracellular expression of adherens junction proteins (vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin and β-catenin) was maintained in vascular endothelial cells that lacked paracellular claudin-5 expression and which showed reversible post-translational occludin modification. Claudin-1 expression paralleled the loss and recovery of claudin-5, while claudin-3 or -12 immunoreactivity was not detected. In addition, the extracellular matrix, as visualized by laminin and fibronectin, underwent extensive reversible remodeling and perivascular CD169 macrophages become abundant throughout the lesioned inferior colliculus. At a time that GFAP-astrocytes repopulated the lesion area and tight junction proteins were returned to paracellular domains, the extracellular matrix and leukocyte profiles normalized and resembled profiles seen in control tissue. This study supports the hypothesis that a combination of paracellular adherens junctional proteins, remodeled basement membrane and the presence of perivascular leukocytes provide a temporary barrier to limit the extravasation of macromolecules and potentially neurotoxic substances into the brain parenchyma until tight junction proteins are restored to paracellular domains.

AB  - Abstract
Increases in plasma osmolality enhance nitric oxide (NO) levels in magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs) of the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and modulate the secretion of both vasopressin (VP) and oxytocin (OT). In this paper, we describe the effects of hypertonicity on the electrical properties of MNCs by focusing on the nitrergic modulation of their activity in this condition. Membrane potentials were measured using the patch clamp technique, in the presence of both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission blockers, in coronal brain slices of male Wistar rats. The recordings were first made under a control condition (295 mosm/kg H2O), then in the presence of a hypertonic stimulus (330 mosm/kg H2O) and, finally, with a hypertonic stimulus plus 500 μM l-Arginine or 100 μM N-nitro-l-Arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (l-NAME). Hypertonicity per se increased the firing frequency of the neurons. l-Arginine prevented the increase in fire frequency induced by hypertonic stimulus, and l-NAME (inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase) induced an additional increase in frequency when applied together with the hypertonic solution. Moreover, l-Arginine hyperpolarizes the resting potential and decreases the peak value of the after-hyperpolarization; both effects were blocked by l-NAME and hypertonicity and/or l-NAME reduced the time constant of the rising phase of the after-depolarization. These results demonstrate that an intrinsic nitrergic system is part of the mechanisms controlling the excitability of MNCs of the SON when the internal fluid homeostasis is disturbed.

AB  - Abstract
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder caused by defective levels of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. SMA causes spinal motoneuron (MN) loss, and progressive muscle weakness and paralysis. Currently, there is no effective therapy to cure this disease. Although different strategies focused on increasing the expression of functional SMN protein have been assayed, numerous SMN-independent therapeutic approaches have been demonstrated to have potential effectiveness in improving the SMA phenotype in mouse models and clinical trials. Recent works have shown that compounds which inhibit GSK-3β activity are effective in promoting MN survival and ameliorating lifespan in models of MN diseases including SMA. Taking into account the reported neuroprotective actions of lithium (Li) through the inhibition of GSK-3β in different studies, we tested here its potential efficiency as a therapeutic agent in a mouse model of severe SMA (SMNΔ7 mice). We show that the chronic treatment with Li initiated before the appearance of disease symptoms, although inhibited GSK-3β, did not improve the median survival, motor behavior, and spinal MN loss linked to SMA. Li administration did not either ameliorate the microglial and astroglial reaction in the spinal cord or the depletion of glutamatergic synapses on MNs observed in SMNΔ7 animals. Moreover, Li treatment did not mitigate muscle atrophy or calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) downregulation in the neuromuscular junctions linked to the disease. However, a significant reduction in apoptotic cell death found in the skeletal muscle of SMA mice was observed after Li treatment.

AB  - AbstractIntroduction
Due to growing evidence of sensorimotor integration impairment in focal task-specific hand dystonia, we aimed at describing primary sensory (S1) and primary motor (M1) cortex source activities and their functional cross-talk during a non-dystonia-inducing sensorimotor task free of biases generated by the interfering with the occurrence of dystonic movements.
Method
Magnetoencephalographic brain signals and opponens pollicis (OP) electromyographic activities were acquired at rest and during a simple isometric contraction performed either alone or in combination with median nerve stimulation. The task was performed separately with the right and left hand by eight patients suffering from focal task-specific hand dystonia and by eight healthy volunteers. Through an ad hoc procedure Functional Source Separation (FSS), distinct sources were identified in S1 (FSS1) and M1 (FSM1) devoted to hand control. Spectral properties and functional coupling (coherence) between the two sources were assessed in alpha [8, 13] Hz, beta [14, 32] Hz and gamma [33, 45] Hz frequency bands.
Results
No differences were found between spectral properties of patients and controls for either FSM1 or FSS1 cerebral sources. Functional coupling between FSM1 and FSS1 (gamma band coherence), while comparable between dystonic patients and healthy controls at rest, was selectively reduced in patients during movement. All findings were present in both hemispheres.
Discussion
Because previous literature has shown that gamma-band sensory–motor synchronization reflects an efficiency index of sensory–motor integration, our data demonstrate that, in dystonic patients, uncoupling replaces the functional coupling required for efficient sensory–motor control during motor exertion. The presence of bi-hemispheric abnormalities in unilateral hand dystonia supports the presence of an endophenotypic trait.

AB  - Abstract
In Parkinson’s disease (PD) levodopa-associated changes in the power and long-range temporal correlations of beta oscillations have been demonstrated, yet the presence and modulation of genuine connectivity in local field potentials (LFP) recorded from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) remains an open question. The present study investigated LFP recorded bilaterally from the STN at wakeful rest in ten patients with PD after overnight withdrawal of levodopa (OFF) and after a single dose levodopa administration (ON). We utilized connectivity measures being insensitive to volume conduction (functional connectivity: non-zero imaginary part of coherency; effective connectivity: phase–slope index). We demonstrated the presence of neuronal interactions in the frequency range of 10–30 Hz in STN–LFP without a preferential directionality of interactions between different contacts along the electrode tracks. While the direction of neuronal interactions per se was preserved after levodopa administration, functional connectivity and the ventral–dorsal information flow were modulated by medication. The OFF–ON differences in functional connectivity were correlated with the levodopa-induced improvement in clinical Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale scores. We hypothesize that regional neuronal interactions, as reflected in STN–LFP connectivity, might represent a basis for the intra-nuclear spatial specificity of deep brain stimulation. Moreover, our results suggest the potential use of volume conduction-insensitive measures of connectivity in STN–LFP as a marker of clinical motor symptoms in PD.

AB  - Abstract
Neurons and neighboring astrocytic glia are mostly studied in nervous tissues from rodents whereas less is known on their properties and interactions in the human brain. Here, confocal/multiphoton fluorescence imaging for several hours revealed that co-cultured fetal human cortical neurons and astrocytes show pronounced spontaneous rises of cytosolic Ca2+ which last for up to several minutes without concomitant changes in either movements or membrane potential of mitochondria. Similar Ca2+ rises were evoked mainly in neurons by bath-applied glutamate or γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) acting via N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) + AMPA/Kainate and GABAA receptors, respectively. Predominantly in astrocytes, Ca2+ baseline was elevated by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) acting via P2Y1 and P2X7 receptors, likely causing the release of glutamate and glutamine. Mainly astrocytes responded to histamine, whereas the activation of muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors raised Ca2+ in both cell types. Evoked neuronal and astrocytic Ca2+ rises could last for several minutes without affecting mitochondrial movements or membrane potential. In contrast, reversible depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential accompanied neuronal Ca2+ rises induced by cyanide-evoked chemical anoxia or the uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration with carbonyl-cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenylhydrazone (FCCP). During such metabolic perturbation, mitochondrial depolarization also occurred in astrocytes, whereas Ca2+ was largely unaffected. In summary, fetal human cortical neurons and astrocytes show distinct patterns of neuro/glio-transmitter- and metabolically-evoked Ca2+ rises and possess active mitochondria. One aspect of our discussion deals with the question of whether the functional mitochondria contribute to cellular Ca2+ homeostasis that seems to be already well-developed in fetal human cortical brain cells.

AB  - Abstract
Tropisetron, a selective 5-HT3 receptor (5-HT3R) antagonist, has been widely used to counteract chemotherapy-induced emesis. New investigations described the immunomodulatory properties of tropisetron which may not be 5HT3R mediated. In the present study, we assessed the potential effects of tropisetron on an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). EAE was induced in C57BL/6 mice by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide (MOG35-55) immunization. Animals were treated with tropisetron (5 mg/kg/day); m-chlorophenylbiguanide (mCPBG), a selective 5-HT3R agonist (10 mg/kg/day); tropisetron (5 mg/kg/day) plus mCPBG (10 mg/kg/day), and granisetron (5 mg/kg/day) intraperitoneally on days 3–35 post-immunization. Treatment with tropisetron and granisetron markedly suppressed the clinical symptoms of EAE (p &lt; 0.001) and reduced leukocyte infiltration as well as demyelination in the spinal cord (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, in vivo tropisetron, granisetron or tropisetron plus mCPBG therapy greatly reduced in vitro MOG35-55-stimulated proliferation of mononuclear cells from spleens, and MOG35-55-induced IL-2, IL-6 and IL-17 production by splenocytes isolated from EAE-induced mice (p &lt; 0.05). Concurrent administration of tropisetron and mCPBG did not significantly alter the histological damage in the spinal cord. mCPBG had no effect on the mentioned parameters. Taken together, these findings indicate that tropisetron has considerable immunoregulatory functions in EAE and may be promising for the treatment of MS or other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases of the CNS. Furthermore, beneficial effects of tropisetron in this setting seem to be both receptor dependent and receptor independent in the early phase of the disease.

AB  - Abstract
Because of its high oxygen demands, neural tissue is predisposed to oxidative stress. Here, our aim was to clarify the cellular localization of antioxidant enzymes in the trigeminal ganglion. We found that the transcriptional factor Sox10 is localized exclusively in satellite glial cells (SGCs) in the adult trigeminal ganglion. The use of transgenic mice that express the fluorescent protein Venus under the Sox10 promoter enabled us to distinguish between neurons and SGCs. Although both superoxide dismutases 1 and 2 were present in the neurons, only superoxide dismutase 1 was identified in SGCs. The enzymes relevant to hydrogen peroxide degradation displayed differential cellular localization, such that neurons were endowed with glutathione peroxidase 1 and thioredoxin 2, and catalase and thioredoxin 2 were present in SGCs. Our immunohistochemical finding showed that only SGCs were labeled by the oxidative damage marker 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine, which indicates that the antioxidant systems of SGCs were less potent. The transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1), the capsaicin receptor, is implicated in inflammatory hyperalgesia, and we demonstrated that topical capsaicin application causes short-lasting mechanical hyperalgesia in the face. Our cell-based assay revealed that TRPV1 agonist stimulation in the presence of TRPV1 overexpression caused reactive oxygen species-mediated caspase-3 activation. Moreover, capsaicin induced the cellular demise of primary TRPV1-positive trigeminal ganglion neurons in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect was inhibited by a free radical scavenger and a pancaspase inhibitor. This study delineates the localization of antioxidative stress-related enzymes in the trigeminal ganglion and reveals the importance of the pivotal role of reactive oxygen species in the TRPV1-mediated caspase-dependent cell death of trigeminal ganglion neurons. Therapeutic measures for antioxidative stress should be taken to prevent damage to trigeminal primary sensory neurons in inflammatory pain disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Dysfunctional glutamatergic neurotransmission has been implicated in schizophrenia and mood disorders. As a putative model for these disorders, a mouse line lacking the GluA1 subunit (GluA1-KO) of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptor displays a robust novelty-induced hyperlocomotion associated with excessive neuronal activation in the hippocampus. Agonists of metabotropic glutamate 2/3 receptors (mGluR2/3) inhibit glutamate release in various brain regions and they have been shown to inhibit neuronal activation in the hippocampus. Here, we tested a hypothesis that novelty-induced hyperlocomotion in the GluA1-KO mice is mediated via excessive hippocampal neuronal activation by analyzing whether an mGluR2/3 agonist inhibits this phenotypic feature. GluA1-KO mice and littermate wildtype (WT) controls were administered with (1S,2S,5R,6S)-2-aminobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylic acid (LY354740) (15 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min before a 2-h exposure to novel arenas after which c-Fos immunopositive cells were analyzed in the hippocampus. LY354740 (15 mg/kg) decreased hyperactivity in male GluA1-KO mice, with only a minimal effect in WT controls. This was observed in two cohorts of animals, one naïve to handling and injections, another pre-handled and accustomed to injections. LY354740 (15 mg/kg) also reduced the excessive c-Fos expression in the dorsal hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell layer in maleGluA1-KO mice, while not affecting c-Fos levels in WT mice. In female mice, no significant effect for LY354740 (15 mg/kg) on hyperactive behavior or hippocampal c-Fos was observed in either genotype or treatment cohort. A higher dose of LY354740 (30 mg/kg) alleviated hyperlocomotion of GluA1-KO males, but not that of GluA1-KO females. In conclusion, the excessive behavioral hyperactivity of GluA1-KO mice can be partly prevented by reducing neuronal excitability in the hippocampus with the mGluR2/3 agonist suggesting that the hippocampal reactivity is strongly involved in the behavioral phenotype of GluA1-KO mice.

AB  - Abstract
Recently it has been suggested that the neurohormone prolactin (PRL) could act on the afferent nociceptive neurons. Indeed, PRL sensitizes transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels present in nociceptive C-fibers and consequently reduces the pain threshold in a model of inflammatory pain. Accordingly, high plasma PRL levels in non-lactating females have been associated with several painful conditions (e.g. migraine).

Paradoxically, an increase of PRL secretion during lactation induced a reduction in pain sensitivity. This difference could be attributed to the fact that PRL secreted from the adenopituitary (AP) is transformed into several molecular variants by the suckling stimulation. In order to test this hypothesis, the present study set out to investigate whether PRL from AP of suckled (S) or non-suckled (NS) lactating rats affects the activity of the male Wistar wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons. The WDR neurons are located in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and receive input from the first-order neurons (Ab-, Ad- and C-fibers). Spinal administration of prolactin variant from NS rats (NS-PRL) or prolactin variant from S rats (S-PRL) had no effect on the neuronal activity of non-nociceptive Ab-fibers. However, the activities of nociceptive Ad-fibers and C-fibers were: (i) increased by NS-PRL and (ii) diminished by S-PRL. Either NS-PRL or S-PRL enhanced the post-discharge activity.

Taken together, these results suggest that PRL from S or NS lactating rats could either facilitate or depress the nociceptive responses of spinal dorsal horn cells, depending on the physiological state of the rats.

AB  - Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gasotransmitter endogenously generated from the metabolism of l-cysteine by action of two main enzymes called cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE). This gas has been involved in the pain processing and insulin resistance produced during diabetes development. However, there is no evidence about its participation in the peripheral neuropathy induced by this metabolic disorder. Experimental diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (50 mg/kg, i.p.) in female Wistar rats. Streptozotocin injection increased formalin-evoked flinching in diabetic rats as compared to non-diabetic rats after 2 weeks. Peripheral administration of NaHS (an exogenous donor of H2S) and l-cysteine (an endogenous donor of H2S) dose-dependently increased flinching behavior in diabetic and non-diabetic rats.

Contrariwise, hydroxylamine (HA, a CBS inhibitor) and dl-propargylglycine (PPG, a CSE inhibitor) decreased formalin-induced nociceptive behavior in both experimental groups. In addition, an ineffective dose of HA and PPG partially prevented the l-cysteine-induced hyperalgesia in diabetic and non-diabetic rats. Interestingly, HA and PPG were three order of magnitude more potent in diabetic rats respect to non-diabetic rats, whereas NaHS was ten times more potent in the streptozotocin-diabetic group. Nine to 11 weeks after diabetes induction, tactile allodynia was observed in the streptozotocin-injected rats. On this condition, subcutaneous administration of PPG or HA reduced tactile allodynia in diabetic rats. Paradoxically, H2S levels were decreased in nerve sciatic, dorsal root ganglion and spinal cord, but not paw nor blood plasma, during diabetes-associated peripheral neuropathy development. Collectively, results suggest that H2S synthesized by CBS and CSE participate in formalin-induced nociception in diabetic and non-diabetic rats, as well as; in tactile allodynia in streptozotocin-injected rats. In addition, data seems to indicate that diabetic rats are more sensible to H2S-induced hyperalgesia than normoglycemic rats.

AB  - Abstract
The human brain can dynamically adapt to the changing surroundings. To explore this issue, we adopted graph theoretical tools to examine changes in electroencephalography (EEG) functional networks while listening to music. Three different excerpts of Chinese Guqin music were played to 16 non-musician subjects. For the main frequency intervals, synchronizations between all pair-wise combinations of EEG electrodes were evaluated with phase lag index (PLI). Then, weighted connectivity networks were created and their organizations were characterized in terms of an average clustering coefficient and characteristic path length. We found an enhanced synchronization level in the alpha2 band during music listening. Music perception showed a decrease of both normalized clustering coefficient and path length in the alpha2 band. Moreover, differences in network measures were not observed between musical excerpts. These experimental results demonstrate an increase of functional connectivity as well as a more random network structure in the alpha2 band during music perception. The present study offers support for the effects of music on human brain functional networks with a trend toward a more efficient but less economical architecture.

AB  - Abstract
Acute osmolar loading of cerebrospinal fluid within one lateral ventricle of dogs was examined as a cause of water extraction from the bloodstream and an increase in intracranial pressure. We have shown that a certain amount of 3H2O from the bloodstream enters osmotically loaded cerebrospinal fluid significantly faster, hence causing a significant increase in intracranial pressure. The noted phenomenon in which intracranial pressure still significantly increases, but in which the hyperosmolarity of the cerebrospinal fluid is no longer present, was named “compensated hyperosmolarity”. In the case of the sub-chronic application of hyperosmolar solutions into cat ventricles, we observed an increase in cerebrospinal fluid volume and a more pronounced development of hydrocephalus in the area of application, but without significant increase in intracranial pressure and without blockage of cerebrospinal fluid pathways. These results support the newly proposed hypothesis of cerebrospinal fluid hydrodynamics and the ability to develop new strategies for the treatment of cerebrospinal fluid-related diseases.

AB  - Abstract
Anhedonia, or the inability to experience positive feelings is a hallmark of depression. However, few animal models have relied on decreased positive affect as an index of susceptibility to depression. Rats emit frequency-modulated ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), designated as “positive” calls in the 50-kHz range. USVs have been associated with pharmacological activation of motivational reward circuits. Here we utilized selectively-bred rats differing in “emotionality” to ask whether there are associated differences in USVs. Rats bred based on locomotor response to novelty and classified as bred High Responders (bHRs) or bred Low Responders (bLRs) exhibit inborn differences in response to environmental cues, stress responsiveness, and depression-like behavior. These animals also exhibit differences in anxiety-like behavior, which are reversed by exposure to environmental complexity (EC). Finally, these animals exhibit unique profiles of responsiveness to rewarding stimuli accompanied with distinct patterns of dopamine regulation. We investigated whether acute and chronic environmental manipulations impacted USVs in bHRs and bLRs. We found that, relative to bLRs, bHRs emitted significantly more 50-kHz USVs. However, if a bLR is accompanied by another bLR, there is a significant increase in 50-kHZ USVs emitted by this phenotype. bHRs emitted increases in 50-kHZ UVSs upon first exposure to EC, whereas bLRs showed a similar increase only after repeated exposure. bLRs’ increase in positive affect after chronic EC was coupled with significant positive correlations between corticosterone levels and c-fos mRNA in the accumbens. Conversely, a decline in the rate of positive calls in bHRs after chronic EC was associated with a negative correlation between corticosterone and accumbens c-fos mRNA. These studies demonstrate that inborn differences in emotionality interact with the environment to influence positive affect and underscore the potential interaction between glucocorticoids and the mesolimbic reward circuitry in modulating 50-kHz calls.

AB  - Abstract
17α-Ethynyl-estradiol (EE2, a synthetic steroidal estrogen) induces antidepressant-like effects in the forced swimming test (FST) similar to those induced by 5-HT and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (dual antidepressants). However, the precise mechanism of action of EE2 has not been studied.

In the present study, the participation of estrogen receptors (ERs) and the serotonergic and the noradrenergic presynaptic sites in the antidepressant-like action of EE2 was evaluated in the FST. The effects of the ER antagonist ICI 182,780 (10 μg/rat; i.c.v.), the serotonergic and noradrenergic terminal destruction with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT; 200 μg/rat, i.c.v.), and N-(2-chloro-ethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP4; 10 mg/kg, i.p.) were studied in ovariectomized rats treated with EE2 and subjected to the FST. In addition, the participation of α2-adrenergic receptors in the antidepressant-like action of EE2 was explored using the selective α2-receptor antagonist idazoxan (0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg, i.p.).

EE2 induced an antidepressant-like action characterized by a decrease in immobility behavior with a concomitant increase in swimming and climbing behaviors. The ER antagonist, 5,7-DHT, DSP4, and idazoxan blocked the effects of EE2 on the immobility behavior, whereas ICI 182,780 and 5,7-DHT affected swimming behavior. The noradrenergic compound DSP4 altered climbing behavior, while Idazoxan inhibited the increase of swimming and climbing behaviors induced by EE2. Our results suggest that the antidepressant-like action of EE2 implies a complex mechanism of action on monoaminergic systems and estrogen receptors.

AB  - Abstract
Neuronal losses have been shown to occur in the brainstem following a neonatal hypoxic–ischaemic (HI) insult. In particular serotonergic neurons, situated in the dorsal raphé nuclei, appear to be vulnerable to HI injury. Nonetheless the mechanisms contributing to losses of serotonergic neurons in the brainstem remain to be elucidated. One possible mechanism is that disruption of neural projections from damaged forebrain areas to dorsal raphé nuclei may play a role in the demise of serotonergic neurons. To test this, postnatal day 3 (P3) rat pups underwent unilateral common carotid artery ligation followed by hypoxia (6% O2 for 30 min). On P38 a retrograde tracer, fluorescent-coupled choleratoxin b, was deposited in the dorsal raphé dorsal (DR dorsal) nucleus or the dorsal raphé ventral (DR ventral) nucleus. Compared to control animals, P3 HI animals had significant losses of retrogradely labelled neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex, preoptic area and lateral habenula after tracer deposit in the DR dorsal nucleus. On the other hand, after tracer deposit in the DR ventral nucleus, we found significant reductions in numbers of retrogradely labelled neurons in the hypothalamus, preoptic area and medial amygdala in P3 HI animals compared to controls. Since losses of descending inputs are associated with decreases in serotonergic neurons in the brainstem raphé nuclei, we propose that disruption of certain descending neural inputs from the forebrain to the DR dorsal and the DR ventral nuclei may contribute to losses of serotonergic neurons after P3 HI. It is important to delineate the phenotypes of different neuronal networks affected by neonatal HI, and the mechanisms underpinning this damage, so that interventions can be devised to target and protect axons from the harmful effects of neonatal HI.

AB  - Abstract
Adult neurogenesis occurs throughout life; however the majority of new neurons do not survive. Enhancing the survival of these new neurons will increase the likelihood that these neurons could return function following injury. Inhibition of Rho kinase is known to increase neurite outgrowth and regeneration. Previous work in our lab has demonstrated a role for Rho kinase inhibition and survival of new born neurons from the sub-ventricular zone. In this study we examined the role of Rho kinase inhibition on hippocampal neurogenesis. Two concentrations of Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 (20 and 100 μM) and the proliferative marker EdU were infused in the lateral ventricle for 7 days. Quantification of doublecortin+/EdU+ cells on the 7th day showed that cell numbers were not significantly different, suggesting no effect on neuroblast generation. Following infusion of 100 μM Y27632, the number of newborn NeuN+/EdU+ neurons at 35 days in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus of the ipsilateral side of the infusion did not display a significant difference; however there was an increase on the contralateral side, suggesting a dose effect. Infusion of a lower dose (20 μM) of Y27632 resulted in an increase in NeuN+/EdU+ cells in the granular cell layer of the ipsilateral side at 35 days. These mice also demonstrated enhanced spatial memory as tested by the Y maze with no significant changes in anxiety or novel object recognition. Rho kinase inhibition enhanced the survival of new born neurons in the dentate gyrus with a specific dosage effect. These results suggest that inhibition of Rho kinase following injury could be beneficial for increasing the survival of new neurons that may aid recovery.

AB  - Abstract
The kinetics of neurotransmitter release was recognized recently as an important contributor to synaptic efficiency. Since adenosine is the ubiquitous modulator of presynaptic release in peripheral and central synapses, in the current project we studied the action of this purine on the timing of acetylcholine quantal release from motor nerve terminals in the skeletal muscle. Using extracellular recording from frog neuromuscular junction we tested the action of adenosine on the latencies of single quantal events in the pro-oxidant and antioxidant conditions. We found that adenosine, in addition to previously known inhibitory action on release probability, also synchronized release by removing quantal events with long latencies. This action of adenosine on release timing was abolished by oxidants whereas in the presence of the antioxidant the synchronizing action of adenosine was further enhanced. Interestingly, unlike the timing of release, the inhibitory action of adenosine on release probability was redox-independent. Modulation of release timing by adenosine was mediated by purinergic A1 receptors as it was eliminated by the specific A1 antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) and mimicked by the specific A1 agonist N(6)-cyclopentyl-adenosine. Consistent with data obtained from dispersion of single quantal events, adenosine also reduced the rise-time of multiquantal synaptic currents. The latter effect was reproduced in the model based on synchronizing effect of adenosine on release timing. Thus, adenosine which is generated at the neuromuscular junction from the breakdown of the co-transmitter ATP induces the synchronization of quantal events. The effect of adenosine on release timing should preserve the fidelity of synaptic transmission via “cost-effective” use of less transmitter quanta. Our findings also revealed important crosstalk between purinergic and redox modulation of synaptic processes which could take place in the elderly or in neuromuscular diseases associated with oxidative stress like lateral amyotrophic sclerosis.

AB  - Abstract
The kinin-B2 receptor (B2BKR) activated by its endogenous ligand bradykinin participates in various metabolic processes including the control of arterial pressure and inflammation. Recently, functions for this receptor in brain development and protection against glutamate-provoked excitotoxicity have been proposed. Here, we report neuroprotective properties for bradykinin against organophosphate poisoning using acute hippocampal slices as an in vitro model. Following slice perfusion for 10 min with diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) to initiate the noxious stimulus, responses of pyramidal neurons upon an electric impulse were reduced to less than 30% of control amplitudes. Effects on synaptic-elicited population spikes were reverted when preparations had been exposed to bradykinin 30 min after challenging with DFP. Accordingly, bradykinin-induced population spike recovery was abolished by HOE-140, a B2BKR antagonist. However, the kinin-B1 receptor (B1BKR) agonist Lys-des-Arg9-bradykinin, inducing the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK/MAPK) and cell death, abolished bradykinin-mediated neuroprotection, an effect, which was reverted by the ERK inhibitor PD98059. In agreement with pivotal B1BKR functions in this process, antagonism of endogenous B1BKR activity alone was enough for restoring population spike activity. On the other hand pralidoxime, an oxime, reactivating acetylcholinesterase (AChE) after organophosphate poisoning, induced population spike recovery after DFP exposure in the presence of bradykinin and Lys-des-Arg9-bradykinin. Lys-des-Arg9-bradykinin did not revert protection exerted by pralidoxime, however when instead bradykinin and Ly-des-Arg9-bradykinin were superfused together, recovery of population spikes diminished. These findings again confirm the neuroprotective feature of bradykinin, which is, diminished by its endogenous metabolites, stimulating the B1BKR, providing a novel understanding of the physiological roles of these receptors.

Cortical sensory representations can be reorganized by sensory exposure in an epoch of early development. The adaptive role of this type of plasticity for natural sounds in sensory development is, however, unclear. We have reared rats in a naturalistic, complex acoustic environment and examined their auditory representations. We found that cortical neurons became more selective to spectrotemporal features in the experienced sounds. At the neuronal population level, more neurons were involved in representing the whole set of complex sounds, but fewer neurons actually responded to each individual sound, but with greater magnitudes. A comparison of population-temporal responses to the experienced complex sounds revealed that cortical responses to different renderings of the same song motif were more similar, indicating that the cortical neurons became less sensitive to natural acoustic variations associated with stimulus context and sound renderings. By contrast, cortical responses to sounds of different motifs became more distinctive, suggesting that cortical neurons were tuned to the defining features of the experienced sounds. These effects lead to emergent “categorical” representations of the experienced sounds, which presumably facilitate their recognition.

AB  - Abstract
Bitter reception is mediated by taste receptor cells that coexpress multiple T2Rs, a family of G-protein-coupled receptors. However, it remains elusive how bitter taste information is translated in the brain into appropriate behavioral responses. Here we used a combination of genetic tracing and electrophysiological and immunohistochemical analyses in mice to functionally characterize the neurons in the solitary tract nuclei of the medulla, which receive input from mT2R5-expressing cells. The neurons defined by a transneuronal tracer originating from mT2R5-expressing cells receive glutamatergic synaptic input via the AMPA receptor. The satiety peptide cholecystokinin increases glutamatergic transmission, suggesting an interaction between information processing of taste and the homeostatic control of feeding. Nevertheless, the tracer-labeled neuron types are heterogeneous, and can be classified into catecholamine and pro-opiomelanocortin neurons. Our data reveal that the architectural solution in the first-order central relay that processes information from mT2R5-expressing cells uses unique ensembles of neurons with different neurotransmitters.

AB  - Abstract
The neurobiological mechanisms underlying the suppression of neuropathic pain by spinal cord stimulation (SCS) are still incompletely known. The present study aims at exploring whether the descending pain control system in the rostroventromedial medulla (RVM) exerts a role in the attenuation of neuropathic pain by SCS. Experiments were performed in the rat spared nerve injury (SNI) pain model. The effects of SCS on neuronal activity of pronociceptive ON-like, antinociceptive OFF-like, and neutral cells, including 5-HT-like cells, in the RVM were analyzed in SCS responding and SCS non-responding SNI animals as well as in naïve controls. Decreased spontaneous activities in OFF-like cells and increased spontaneous activities in ON-like cells were observed in SNI animals, whereas the spontaneous activities of 5-HT-like and neutral cells were unchanged. SCS produced a prominent increase in the discharge of OFF- and 5-HT-like cells in SCS responding, but not in non-responding SNI animals or controls. Discharge rates of ON-like and neutral cell were not affected by SCS. In awake SNI animals, microinjection of a GABAA receptor agonist, muscimol, into the RVM significantly attenuated the antihypersensitivity effect induced by SCS while a non-selective opioid receptor antagonist, naltrexone, was ineffective.

It is concluded that SCS may shift the reciprocal inhibitory and facilitatory pain modulation balance controlled by the RVM in favor of inhibition. This increase in the descending antinociceptive effect operates in concert with segmental spinal mechanisms in producing pain relief.

AB  - Abstract
A high-fat diet (HFD) can increase hypothalamic galanin (GAL). GAL has recently been shown to inhibit opiate reward, which in turn, decreases cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We hypothesized that injection of GAL into the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), or consumption of a HFD, would be associated with a decrease in NAc CREB. In Exp. 1, GAL in the PVN of naïve rats decreased phosphorylated-CREB (pCREB) which is the activated form of CREB, in the NAc compared to saline-injected controls. In Exp. 2, rats fed ad libitum HFD for 4 weeks had reduced NAc pCREB levels compared to rats with sporadic tastes of the HFD. Body weight, serum triglyceride and leptin levels were also raised in the chronic HFD-fed rats. These data suggest that PVN GAL or chronic intake of a HFD can decrease NAc pCREB. The implications of these findings may help to explain the lack of opiate-like withdrawal that has been reported in response to overeating a HFD, thereby providing a potential mechanism underlying behavioral differences seen with addiction-like overconsumption of different types of palatable foods.

AB  - Abstract
The executive clock drawing task (CLOX) is one of the widely used clock drawing tests (CDTs) and is composed of CLOX1, an unprompted CDT, and CLOX2, a simple copying CDT. Although it is conceptually believed that CLOX1 is sensitive to both executive function and constructional ability while CLOX2 reflects only constructional ability, there are still lack of studies on the functional neuroanatomical substrates of CLOX1 and 2 performances. This study aimed to identify the functional brain correlates of CLOX1 and 2 performances in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). CLOX was administered to 139 AD patients and 50 normal controls, and regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCMglc) was measured by 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography. Correlations between CLOX scores and rCMglc were examined on a voxel-by-voxel basis in AD patients. For the overall AD group, significant positive correlations between CLOX1 and rCMglc were found in the bilateral temporo-parietal and left middle frontal regions, while CLOX2 was correlated with rCMglc of the bilateral temporo-parietal regions. Additional subgroup analysis showed that CLOX1 was associated with the left temporal metabolism in less severe AD, and with the right temporo-parietal metabolism in more severe AD. In contrast, CLOX2 was correlated with rCMglc of the diffuse right fronto-temporo-parietal regions in more severe AD, but not with any rCMglc in less severe AD. This is the first neuroimaging study on the functional neuroanatomical correlates of CLOX performances in AD. Given the relationships between specific cognitive performances and regional brain functions, the findings probably support the notion that CLOX1 demands not merely visuospatial functions but also executive control, while CLOX2 depends mainly on visuospatial ability. Our results also indicate that each CLOX performance depends on very different functional brain regions according to AD clinical stages.

AB  - Abstract
The noradrenergic system of the brain is thought to facilitate neuronal processes that promote behavioral activation, alertness, and attention. It is known that norepinephrine (NE) can be significantly elevated in the prefrontal cortex under normal conditions such as arousal and attention, and following the administration of psychostimulants and various other drugs prescribed for psychiatric disorders. However, how NE modulates neuronal activity and synapses in the local prefrontal circuitry remains elusive. In this study, we characterized the actions of NE on individual monosynaptic connections among layer V pyramidal neurons (P) and fast-spiking (FS) GABAergic interneurons in the juvenile (postnatal days 20–23) rat prefrontal local circuitry. We found that NE selectively depresses excitatory synaptic transmission in P–FS connections but has no detectable effect on the excitatory synapses in P–P connections and the inhibitory synapses in FS–P connections. NE apparently exerts distinctly different modulatory actions on identified synapses that target GABAergic interneurons but has no effect on those in the pyramidal neurons in this specific developmental period. These results indicate that, depending on the postsynaptic targets, the effects of NE in prefrontal cortex are synapse-specific, at least in the juvenile animals.

AB  - Abstract
Since brain ischemia is one of the leading causes of adult disability and death, neuroprotection of the ischemic brain is of particular importance. Acute neuroprotective strategies usually have the aim of suppressing glutamate excitotoxicity and an excessive N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function. Clinically tolerated antagonists should antagonize an excessive NMDA receptor function without compromising the normal synaptic function. Kynurenic acid (KYNA) an endogenous metabolite of the tryptophan metabolism, may be an attractive neuroprotectant in this regard. The manipulation of brain KYNA levels was earlier found to effectively enhance the histopathological outcome of experimental ischemic/hypoxic states. The present investigation of the neuroprotective capacity of L-kynurenine sulfate (L-KYNs) administered systemically after reperfusion in a novel distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) model of focal ischemia/reperfusion revealed that in contrast with earlier results, treatment with L-KYNs worsened the histopathological outcome of dMCAO. This contradictory result indicates that post-ischemic treatment with L-KYNs may be harmful.

AB  - Abstract
Planarians possess a rudimentary brain with many features in common with vertebrate brains. They also display a remarkable capacity for tissue regeneration including the complete regeneration of the nervous system. Using the induction of planarian seizure-like movements (pSLMs) as a behavioral endpoint, we demonstrate that an intact nervous system is necessary for this organism to react to cocaine exposure, but not necessary to react to nicotine administration. Decapitated planarians (Girardia tigrina) display pSLMs indistinguishable from intact worms when exposed to nicotine, but cocaine-induced pSLMs are reduced by about 95% upon decapitation. Decapitated worms recover their normal sensitivity to cocaine within 5 days after head amputation. In worms where half of the brain was removed or partially dissected, the expression of cocaine-induced pSLMs was reduced by approximately 75%. Similar amputations at the level of the tail did not show a significant decrease to cocaine exposure. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first report that explores how regenerating planarians react to the exposure of cocaine.

AB  - Abstract
The notion that blockade of constitutive protein synthesis underlies the effect of protein synthesis inhibitors (PSIs) on long-term potentiation (LTP) stabilization was examined using the rat hippocampal CA3–CA1 synapse. Using a biochemical assay we found protein synthesis rate largely recovered 1 h after wash-out of cycloheximide (CHX). Nonetheless, a 4-h CHX application followed by wash-out 1 h prior to LTP resulted in a significant decrement of LTP stabilization. Wash-out initiated just prior to LTP, thus extending protein synthesis inhibition well into the post-LTP period, resulted in no further effect on LTP. However, short pre- and continuous post-tetanization application of PSIs failed to influence LTP persistence for up to 7 h. Addition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) 5–25 min following LTP induction resulted in parallel depression of potentiated and non-potentiated inputs, leaving LTP seemingly unaltered. However, in the presence of cyxloheximide the H2O2 application resulted in a significant reduction of LTP. In conclusion: LTP stabilization was impaired by pre-LTP application of protein synthesis inhibition but not by post-LTP application unless the slices were exposed to oxidative stress. We submit that these results favor the notion that constitutive rather than triggered protein synthesis is important for LTP stabilization.

AB  - Abstract
There are a limited number of biological indices for assessing pro-emetic states in laboratory rodents as they do not possess the vomiting response. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that in rats, pro-emetic intervention would affect the respiratory pattern. To this end, using whole-body plethysmography, in adult male Wistar rats we recorded respiration after i.p. administration of either the emetic agent LiCl or Ringer. Quantification of respiratory signals (from 5 to 35 min post-injection) revealed that post-LiCl, mean respiratory rate was significantly lower (126 ± 9 vs. 178 ± 10 cpm, p &lt; 0.005) and less variable (Kvar 59 ± 8% vs. 73 ± 3%; p &lt; 0.05) compared to the post-Ringer condition. Furthermore, while mode values of respiratory rate histograms did not differ between the treatments (indicating that the dominant respiratory frequency remained unchanged), LiCl reduced the fraction of time spent at high respiratory rate (&gt;200 cpm) from 25 ± 3% to 9 ± 2% (p = 0.004). Thus, reduction of the mean respiratory rate by LiCl was predominantly due to reduced contribution of high-frequency breathing that is normally associated with motor activity and/or arousal. Non-linear multifractal analysis of respiratory signals revealed that post-LiCl, respiration becomes less random and more orderly. 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron prevented respiratory changes elicited by LiCl. We conclude that the observed changes likely reflect effects of LiCl on animals’ motion, and that this effect is mediated via 5-HT3 receptors. Providing that the effects observed in our study were quite robust, we suggest that simple and non-invasive respiratory monitoring may be a promising approach for studying emesis in rodents.

AB  - Abstract
Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep electroencephalographic (EEG) delta power (∼0.5–4 Hz), also known as slow wave activity (SWA), is typically enhanced after acute sleep deprivation (SD) but not after chronic sleep restriction (CSR). Recently, sleep-active cortical neurons expressing neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) were identified and associated with enhanced SWA after short acute bouts of SD (i.e., 6 h). However, the relationship between cortical nNOS neuronal activity and SWA during CSR is unknown. We compared the activity of cortical neurons expressing nNOS (via c-Fos and nNOS immuno-reactivity, respectively) and sleep in rats in three conditions: (1) after 18-h of acute SD; (2) after five consecutive days of sleep restriction (SR) (18-h SD per day with 6 h ad libitum sleep opportunity per day); (3) and time-of-day matched ad libitum sleep controls. Cortical nNOS neuronal activity was enhanced during sleep after both 18-h SD and 5 days of SR treatments compared to control treatments. SWA and NREM sleep delta energy (the product of NREM sleep duration and SWA) were positively correlated with enhanced cortical nNOS neuronal activity after 18-h SD but not 5 days of SR. That neurons expressing nNOS were active after longer amounts of acute SD (18 h vs. 6 h reported in the literature) and were correlated with SWA further suggest that these cells might regulate SWA. However, since these neurons were active after CSR when SWA was not enhanced, these findings suggest that mechanisms downstream of their activation are altered during CSR.

AB  - Abstract
Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) has been considered one of the molecular culprits for neuropathic pain. Understanding how LPA changes the function of primary afferent fibers might be an essential step for clarifying the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain. The present study was designed to identify the primary afferent fibers (Aβ, Aδ, or C) participating in LPA-induced allodynia in ddY mice. Mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were evaluated by the von Frey filament test and thermal paw withdrawal test, respectively. Sensory nerve fiber responsiveness was measured using a Neurometer. Daily repeated intrathecal treatment with LPA led to a decrease in the mechanical, but not thermal nociceptive threshold, and a reduction in the threshold for paw withdrawal induced by 2000-Hz (Aβ fiber) and 250-Hz (Aδ fiber), but not 5-Hz (C fiber) sine-wave electrical stimulation. When the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) receptor agonist resiniferatoxin (RTX) was administered subcutaneously before the start of LPA treatment, LPA-induced mechanical allodynia and Aβ and Aδ fiber hypersensitivity demonstrated by neurometry were not affected, indicating that TRPV1-expressing nerve fibers (possibly C fibers) might not be essential for LPA-induced allodynia. LPA-induced allodynia was reversed by treatment with RTX at 7 days after the start of LPA treatment. Expression of TRPV1 on myelinated nerve fibers after repeated intrathecal LPA treatment was observed in the dorsal root ganglion. These results suggest that sensitization of Aβ and Aδ fibers, but not C fibers, contributes to the development of intrathecally administered LPA-induced mechanical allodynia. Moreover, increased or newly expressed TRPV1 receptors in Aβ and Aδ fibers are considered to be involved in the maintenance of LPA-induced allodynia.

AB  - Abstract
Increasing evidence has linked membrane cholesterol to amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. β-Sitosterol (BS) is one of the most common forms of plant sterols, with the structure very similar to that of cholesterol. Using HT22 mouse hippocampal cells, this study investigated whether the substitution of membrane cholesterol with BS influences APP metabolism. It was found that cholesterol/BS substitution promoted nonamyloidogenic processing of APP without affecting membrane fluidity. Additional experiments suggest that the effect of membrane BS on APP metabolism is associated with the migration of APP from lipid rafts toward non-raft regions. Given that dietary BS can enter the brain and accumulates in the plasma membrane of brain cells, these results suggest a potential use of BS in the prevention of Alzheimer’s disease.

AB  - Abstract
A number of psychiatric illnesses have been associated with prenatal disturbance of brain development, including autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia. Individuals afflicted with these disorders exhibit both repetitive motor and cognitive behavior. The potential role that environmental insult to the developing brain may play in generating these aberrant behaviors is unclear. Here we examine the behavioral consequences of an early gestational insult in the non-human primate. Rhesus macaques were exposed to x-irradiation during the first trimester of development to disrupt neurogenesis. The behavior of five fetally irradiated monkeys (FIMs) and five control monkeys (CONs) was observed as they matured from juvenile (1.5 years) to adult ages (4–5 years). Home-cage behavior was indistinguishable in the two groups. In the testing cage, circling was prevalent in both groups at juvenile ages, persisting to adulthood in three of the five FIMs. One FIM executed a ritualized motor sequence marked by semi-circling and undulating head movements. Seven macaques (4 FIMs, 3 CONs) were tested on a spatial Delayed Alternation (DA) task as adults. Perseverative errors and non-perseverative errors were recorded in early stages of the testing, at the 0 delay interval. While performing DA, FIMs made more errors of perseveration than CONs yet the number of total errors committed did not differ between groups. The presence of motor stereotypies and cognitive perseveration in fetally irradiated non-human primates suggests that environmental insult to the embryonic brain may contribute to repetitive motor and cognitive behaviors in neuropsychiatric diseases.

AB  - Abstract
Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and age-matched typically-developing (TD) peers were tested on two forms of eyeblink conditioning (EBC), a Pavlovian associative learning paradigm where subjects learn to execute an appropriately-timed eyeblink in response to a previously neutral conditioning stimulus (CS). One version of the task, trace EBC, interposes a stimulus-free interval between the presentation of the CS and the unconditioned stimulus (US), a puff of air to the eye which causes the subjects to blink. In delay EBC, the CS overlaps in time with the delivery of the US, usually with both stimuli terminating simultaneously. ASD children performed normally during trace EBC, exhibiting no differences from TD subjects with regard to the learning rate or the timing of the conditioned response. However, when subsequently tested on delay EBC, subjects with ASD displayed abnormally-timed conditioned eye blinks that began earlier and peaked sooner than those of TD subjects, consistent with previous findings. The results suggest an impaired ability of children with ASD to properly time conditioned eye blinks which appears to be specific to delay EBC. We suggest that this deficit may reflect a dysfunction of the cerebellar cortex in which increases in the intensity or duration of sensory input can temporarily disrupt the accuracy of motor timing over short temporal intervals.

AB  - Abstract
Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia have been linked to disturbances in GABA neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Furthermore, cognitive deficits in schizophrenia appear well before the onset of psychosis and have been reported to be present during early childhood and even during the first year of life. Taken together, these data raise the following question: Does the disease process that produces abnormalities in prefrontal GABA neurons in schizophrenia begin prenatally and disrupt the ontogeny of cortical GABA neurons? Here, we address this question through a consideration of evidence that genetic and/or environmental insults that occur during gestation initiate a pathogenetic process that alters cortical GABA neuron ontogeny and produces the pattern of GABA neuron abnormalities, and consequently cognitive difficulties, seen in schizophrenia. First, we review available evidence from postmortem human brain tissue studies characterizing alterations in certain subpopulations of prefrontal GABA neuron that provide clues to a prenatal origin in schizophrenia. Second, we review recent discoveries of transcription factors, cytokine receptors, and other developmental regulators that govern the birth, migration, specification, maturation, and survival of different subpopulations of prefrontal GABA neurons. Third, we discuss recent studies demonstrating altered expression of these ontogenetic factors in the PFC in schizophrenia. Fourth, we discuss the potential role of disturbances in the maternal–fetal environment such as maternal immune activation in the development of GABA neuron dysfunction. Finally, we propose critical questions that need to be answered in future research to further investigate the role of altered GABA neuron ontogeny in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.

AB  - Abstract
Pretend play, emerging at about 18 months, and explicit false belief (FB) understanding, arising around 4 years, constitute two pivotal milestones in the development of a Theory of Mind since both involve the ability to separate real from non-real content. The developmental lag has evoked vivid discussion with respect to whether or not pretense (PT) involves a metarepresentational understanding similar to FB. However, in children PT and FB have not yet been contrasted on a neural level to reveal whether they are subserved by the same neurocognitive mechanism. Therefore, the present event-related potential (ERP) study compared PT to a FB and to a non-mental control condition in 6- to 8-year-old children. Results revealed distinct ERP components for PT and FB. PT elicited a parietal P2, which was assumed to reflect the detection of incongruence, and a negative frontal slow wave (290–600 ms), which was associated with the identification of the intention underlying the pretend behavior. In contrast, FB evoked the characteristic positive fronto-central late slow wave (290–920 ms) that is supposed to indicate metarepresentation. Further, the broad distribution of the anterior slow-wave patterns associated with PT and FB reasoning was assumed to reflect the ongoing structural development and neural specialization of the respective areas, indicating the developmental progress in conceptualizing the mental domain. Given the differences in latency, polarity, and topography, PT and FB seem to rely on distinct neural substrates in children. The early negative frontal slow wave indicates that for PT reasoning children may use simple mentalizing processes such as intention processing, whereas the late positive slow-wave shows that for FB children may engage in metarepresentational processing. Therefore, the present findings seem to substantiate theoretical accounts postulating simple mentalistic reasoning for PT in children.

AB  - Abstract
The endocannabinoid system is implicated in the neurobiology of cocaine addiction. This study evaluated the status of cannabinoid (CB) CB1 and CB2 receptors, the endocytic cycle of CB1 receptors, G protein-coupled receptor regulatory kinases (GRK), and associated signaling (mammalian target of rapamicin (mTOR) and 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K)) in brain cortices of drug abusers and cocaine- and cannabinoid-treated rodents. The main results indicate that in cocaine adddicts, but not in mixed cocaine/opiate or opiate abusers, CB1 receptor protein in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) was reduced (−44%, total homogenate) with a concomitant receptor redistribution and/or internalization (decreases in membranes and increases in cytosol). In cocaine addicts, the reductions of CB1 receptors and GRK2/3/5 (−26% to −30%) indicated receptor desensitization. CB2 receptor protein was not significantly altered in the PFC of cocacine addicts. Chronic cocaine in mice and rats also reduced CB1 receptor protein (−41% and −80%) in the cerebral cortex inducing receptor redistribution and/or internalization. The CB1 receptor agonist WIN55212-2 caused receptor downregulation (decreases in membranes and cytosol) and the antagonists rimonabant and AM281 induced opposite effects (receptor upregulation in membranes and cytosol). Rimonabant and AM281 also behaved as inverse agonists on the activation of mTOR and its target p70S6K. Chronic cocaine in mice was associated with tolerance to the acute activation of mTOR and p70S6K. In long-term cocaine addicts, mTOR and p70S6K activations were not altered when compared with controls, indicating that CB1 receptor signaling was dampened. The dysregulation of CB1 receptor, GRK2/3/5, and mTOR/p70S6K signaling by cocaine may contribute to alterations of neuroplasticity and/or neurotoxicity in brains of cocaine addicts.

AB  - Abstract
Over the years it has become crystal clear that a variety of processes encode time-of-day information, ranging from gene expression, protein stability, or subcellular localization of key proteins, to the fine tuning of network properties and modulation of input signals, ultimately ensuring that physiology and behavior are properly synchronized to a changing environment. The purpose of this review is to put forward examples (as opposed to generate a comprehensive revision of all the available literature) in which the circadian system displays a remarkable degree of plasticity, from cell autonomous to circuit-based levels. In the literature, the term circadian plasticity has been used to refer to different concepts. The obvious one, more literally, refers to any change that follows a circadian (circa = around, diem = day) pattern, i.e. a daily change of a given parameter. The discovery of daily remodeling of neuronal structures will be referred herein as structural circadian plasticity, and represents an additional and novel phenomenon modified daily. Finally, any plasticity that has to do with a circadian parameter would represent a type of circadian plasticity; as an example, adjustments that allow organisms to adapt their daily behavior to the annual changes in photoperiod is a form of circadian plasticity at a higher organizational level, which is an emergent property of the whole circadian system. Throughout this work we will revisit these types of changes by reviewing recent literature delving around circadian control of clock outputs, from the most immediate ones within pacemaker neurons to the circadian modulation of rest–activity cycles.

AB  - Abstract
Cortical spontaneous activity reflects an animal’s behavioral state and affects neural responses to sensory stimuli. The correlation between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input to single neurons is a key parameter in models of cortical circuitry. Recent measurements demonstrated highly correlated synaptic excitation and inhibition during spontaneous “up-and-down” states, during which excitation accounted for approximately 80% of inhibitory variance (Shu et al., 2003; Haider et al., 2006). Here we report in vivo whole-cell estimates of the correlation between excitation and inhibition in the rat visual cortex under pentobarbital anesthesia, during which up-and-down states are absent. Excitation and inhibition are weakly correlated, relative to the up-and-down state: excitation accounts for less than 40% of inhibitory variance. Although these correlations are lower than when the circuit cycles between up-and-down states, both behaviors may arise from the same circuitry. Our observations provide evidence that different correlational patterns of excitation and inhibition underlie different cortical states.

AB  - Abstract
Acoustic trauma, a leading cause of sensorineural hearing loss in adults, induces a complex degenerative process in the cochlea. Although previous investigations have identified multiple stress pathways, a comprehensive analysis of cochlear responses to acoustic injury is still lacking. In the current study, we used the next-generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) technique to sequence the whole transcriptome of the normal and noise-traumatized cochlear sensory epithelia (CSE). CSE tissues were collected from rat inner ears 1 d after the rats were exposed to a 120-dB (sound pressure level) noise for 2 h. The RNA-Seq generated over 176 million sequence reads for the normal CSE and over 164 million reads for the noise-traumatized CSE. Alignment of these sequences with the rat Rn4 genome revealed the expression of over 17,000 gene transcripts in the CSE, over 2000 of which were exclusively expressed in either the normal or noise-traumatized CSE. Seventy-eight gene transcripts were differentially expressed (70 upregulated and 8 downregulated) after acoustic trauma. Many of the differentially expressed genes are related to the innate immune system. Further expression analyses using quantitative real time PCR confirmed the constitutive expression of multiple complement genes in the normal organ of Corti and the changes in the expression levels of the complement factor I (Cfi) and complement component 1, s subcomponent (C1s) after acoustic trauma. Moreover, protein expression analysis revealed strong expression of Cfi and C1s proteins in the organ of Corti. Importantly, these proteins exhibited expression changes following acoustic trauma. Collectively, the results of the current investigation suggest the involvement of the complement components in cochlear responses to acoustic trauma.

AB  - Abstract
Because consumption of processed foods has increased in the last decades and so far its potential influence on emotionality and susceptibility to stress is unknown, we studied the influence of different fatty acids (FA) on behavioral and biochemical parameters after acute restrain stress (AS) exposure. Two sequential generations of female rats were supplemented with soybean oil (control group; C-SO), fish oil (FO) and hydrogenated vegetable fat (HVF) from pregnancy and during lactation. At 41 days of age, half the animals of each supplemented group were exposed to AS and observed in open field and elevated plus maze task, followed by euthanasia for biochemical assessments. The HVF-supplemented group showed higher anxiety-like symptoms per se, while the C-SO and FO groups did not show these behaviors. Among groups exposed to AS, HVF showed locomotor restlessness in the open field, while both C-SO and HVF groups showed anxiety-like symptoms in the elevated plus maze, but this was not observed in the FO group. Biochemical evaluations showed higher lipoperoxidation levels and lower cell viability in cortex in the HVF group. In addition, HVF-treated rats showed reduced catalase activity in striatum and hippocampus, as well as increased generation of reactive species in striatum, while FO was associated with increased cell viability in the hippocampus. Among groups exposed to AS, HVF increased reactive species generation in the brain, decreased cell viability in the cortex and striatum, and decreased catalase activity in the striatum and hippocampus. Taken together, our findings show that the type of FA provided during development and growth over two generations is able to modify the brain oxidative status, which was particularly adversely affected by trans fat. In addition, the harmful influence of chronic consumption of trans fats as observed in this study can enhance emotionality and anxiety parameters resulting from stressful situations of everyday life, which can trigger more severe neuropsychiatric conditions.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the largest unmet medical concerns of our society. Around 25 million patients worldwide together with their families are still waiting for an effective treatment. We have recently initiated a re-evaluation of our knowledge of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying sporadic AD. Based on the existing literature, we have proposed a mechanistic explanation of how the late-onset form of the disease may evolve on the cellular level. Here, we expand this hypothesis by addressing the pathophysiological changes underlying the early and almost invariant appearance of the neurofibrillary tangles, the only reliable correlate of the cognitive status, in distinct brain areas and their consistent “spread” along interconnected neurons as the disease advances. In this review we present and discuss novel evidence that the extracellular signaling protein Reelin, expressed along the olfactory and limbic pathways in the adult brain, might hold a key to understand the earliest steps of the disease, highlighting the olfactory pathway as the brain’s Achilles heel involved in the initiation of the pathophysiological characteristic of late-onset AD.

AB  - Abstract
Physical exercise during pregnancy has been considered beneficial to mother and child. Recent studies showed that maternal swimming improves memory in the offspring, increases hippocampal neurogenesis and levels of neurotrophic factors. The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of maternal swimming during pregnancy on redox status and mitochondrial parameters in brain structures from the offspring. Adult female Wistar rats were submitted to five swimming sessions (30 min/day) prior to mating with adult male Wistar rats, and then trained during the pregnancy (five sessions of 30-min swimming/week). The litter was sacrificed when 7 days old, when cerebellum, parietal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum were dissected. We evaluated the production of reactive species and antioxidant status, measuring the activities of superoxide-dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione-peroxidase (GPx), as well as non-enzymatic antioxidants. We also investigated a potential mitochondrial biogenesis regarding mitochondrion mass and membrane potential, through cytometric approaches. Our results showed that maternal swimming exercise promoted an increase in reactive species levels in cerebellum, parietal cortex, and hippocampus, demonstrated by an increase in dichlorofluorescein oxidation. Mitochondrial superoxide was reduced in cerebellum and parietal cortex, while nitrite levels were increased in cerebellum, parietal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. Antioxidant status was improved in cerebellum, parietal cortex, and hippocampus. SOD activity was increased in parietal cortex, and was not altered in the remaining brain structures. CAT and GPx activities, as well as non-enzymatic antioxidant potential, were increased in cerebellum, parietal cortex, and hippocampus of rats whose mothers were exercised. Finally, we observed an increased mitochondrial mass and membrane potential, suggesting mitochondriogenesis, in cerebellum and parietal cortex of pups subjected to maternal swimming. In conclusion, maternal swimming exercise induced neurometabolic programing in the offspring that could be of benefit to the rats against future cerebral insults.

Chronic stress induces dendritic atrophy in the rat primary auditory cortex (A1), a key brain area for auditory attention. The aim of this study was to determine whether repeated restraint stress affects auditory attention and synaptic transmission in A1. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were trained in a two-alternative choice task (2-ACT), a behavioral paradigm to study auditory attention in rats. Trained animals that reached a performance over 80% of correct trials in the 2-ACT were randomly assigned to control and restraint stress experimental groups. To analyze the effects of restraint stress on the auditory attention, trained rats of both groups were subjected to 50 2-ACT trials one day before and one day after of the stress period. A difference score was determined by subtracting the number of correct trials after from those before the stress protocol. Another set of rats was used to study the synaptic transmission in A1. Restraint stress decreased the number of correct trials by 28% compared to the performance of control animals (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, stress reduced the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSC) and miniature IPSC in A1, whereas glutamatergic efficacy was not affected. Our results demonstrate that restraint stress decreased auditory attention and GABAergic synaptic efficacy in A1.

AB  - Abstract
Osmotic swelling of retinal neurons and glial cells is an important pathogenic factor of retinal edema formation. Here, we show that the neuroprotective factor osteopontin (OPN), which is released from retinal glial (Müller) cells after stimulation of the cells with glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (Del Río et al., 2011, Glia 59:821–832), inhibits the swelling of rat Müller cells induced by hypoosmotic exposure of retinal slices in the presence of barium ions and H2O2, respectively, and in slices of postischemic retinas. OPN did not inhibit the hypoosmotic swelling of bipolar cells in slices of control and postischemic retinas. The inhibitory effect of OPN on Müller cell swelling was dose-dependent, with a half-maximal effect at ∼0.6 ng/ml. The effect of OPN was abrogated in the presence of pharmacological blockers of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2, metabotropic glutamate receptors, and purinergic receptors (P2Y1, adenosine A1 receptors), as well as of a neutralizing anti-VEGF antibody. The data suggest that OPN induces the release of VEGF, glutamate, ATP, and adenosine from Müller cells. The effect of OPN was also prevented by blockers of voltage-gated sodium channels (tetrodotoxin), T-type voltage-gated calcium channels (kurtoxin), potassium channels (clofilium), and chloride channels 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB). The swelling-inhibitory effect of OPN was dependent on intracellular calcium signaling, activation of phospholipase C and protein kinase C, and vesicular exocytosis of glutamate. In retinal slices, Müller glial cells display immunoreactivity of OPN. The data suggest that Müller cell-derived OPN has (in addition to the effects on photoreceptors and retinal neurons) autocrine effects. The neuroprotective effects of OPN may be in part mediated by the prevention of cytotoxic Müller cell swelling and the release of VEGF and adenosine from Müller cells.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic stress has been shown to impair memory, however, the extent to which memory can be impaired is often variable across individuals. Predisposed differences in particular traits, such as anxiety, may reveal underlying neurobiological mechanisms that could be driving individual differences in sensitivity to stress and, thus, stress resiliency. Such pre-morbid characteristics may serve as early indicators of susceptibility to stress. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and enkephalin (ENK) are neurochemical messengers of interest implicated in modulating anxiety and motivation circuitry; however, little is known about how these neuropeptides interact with stress resiliency and memory. In this experiment, adult male rats were appetitively trained to locate sugar rewards in a motivation-based spatial memory task before undergoing repeated immobilization stress and then being tested for memory retention. Anxiety-related behaviors, among other characteristics, were monitored longitudinally. Results indicated that stressed animals which showed little to no impairments in memory post-stress (i.e., the more stress-resilient individuals) exhibited lower anxiety levels prior to stress when compared to stressed animals that showed large deficits in memory (i.e., the more stress-susceptible individuals). Interestingly, all stressed animals, regardless of memory change, showed reduced body weight gain as well as thymic involution, suggesting that the effects of stress on metabolism and the immune system were dissociated from the effects of stress on higher cognition, and that stress resiliency seems to be domain-specific rather than a global characteristic within an individual. Neurochemical analyses revealed that NPY in the hypothalamus and amygdala and ENK in the nucleus accumbens were modulated differentially between stress-resilient and stress-susceptible individuals, with elevated expression of these neuropeptides fostering anxiolytic and pro-motivation function, thus driving cognitive resiliency in a domain-specific manner. Findings suggest that such neurochemical markers may be novel targets for pharmacological interventions that can serve to prevent or ameliorate the negative effects of stress on memory.

AB  - Abstract
Enhanced light sensitivity is a common feature of many neuro-ophthalmic conditions and some chronic headaches. Previously we reported that the bright light-evoked increases in trigeminal brainstem neural activity and lacrimation depended on a neurovascular link within the eye (Okamoto et al., 2012). However, the supraspinal pathways necessary for these light-evoked responses are not well defined. To assess the contribution of the posterior hypothalamic area (PH), a brain region closely associated with control of autonomic outflow, we injected bicuculline methiodide (BMI), a GABAa receptor antagonist, into the PH and determined its effect on the encoding properties of ocular neurons at the ventrolateral trigeminal interpolaris/caudalis transition (Vi/Vc) and caudalis/upper cervical cord junction (Vc/C1) regions and on reflex lacrimation in male rats under isoflurane anesthesia. BMI markedly reduced light-evoked (&gt;80%) responses of Vi/Vc and Vc/C1 neurons at 10 min with partial recovery by 50 min after injection. BMI also reduced (&gt;35%) the convergent cutaneous receptive field area of Vi/Vc and Vc/C1 ocular neurons indicating that both intra-ocular and periorbital cutaneous inputs were affected by changes in PH outflow. Light-evoked lacrimation was reduced by &gt;35% at 10 min after BMI, while resting mean arterial pressure increased promptly and remained elevated (&gt;20 mmHg) throughout the 50-min post-injection period. These results suggested that PH stimulation, acting in part through increased sympathetic activity, significantly inhibited light- and facial skin-evoked activity of ocular neurons at the Vi/Vc and Vc/C1 region. These data provide further support for the hypothesis that autonomic outflow plays a critical role in mediating light-evoked trigeminal brainstem neural activity and reflex lacrimation.

AB  - Abstract
γ-Hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is used as an effective therapeutic for reducing the hypersomnolence and cataplexy (loss of motor control) of the sleeping disorder, narcolepsy, with an immediate pharmacologic behavioral action of inducing a natural sleep-like state. Despite its clinical use, few studies have examined the cellular actions of this drug on behavioral state-related neurons. Therefore, we monitored GHB-induced responses using calcium imaging within the laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT) and the dorsal raphe (DR), two pontine nuclei important in state and motor control. In addition, we recorded GHB-induced membrane responses using whole cell, patch clamp electrophysiology of immunohistochemically-identified principal neurons within these nuclei.

GHB induced GABAB receptor-mediated rises in calcium in neurons of the LDT and the DR. However, the pattern and amplitude of calcium rises differed greatly between these two nuclei. GHB induced GABAB receptor antagonist-sensitive outward currents/hyperpolarizations in immunohistochemically-identified cholinergic LDT and serotonergic DR neurons. However, GHB had this action in a greater proportion of DR cells than LDT neurons. Further, larger inhibitory currents were induced in DR cells when compared to the amplitude of GHB-induced current in LDT-responding cells. Finally, NCS-382 and HOCPCA, a reported antagonist and agonist specific to activity at the putative GHB receptor, respectively, with no demonstrated binding at the GABAB receptor, failed to block GHB-induced effects or elicit any discernible electrophysiological action when applied alone, indicating a lack of involvement of a GHB receptor in mediating GHB actions.

Taken together, our data support the conclusion that GHB may be exerting its actions on state and motor control, in part, via an acutely mediated strong inhibition of serotonergic DR neurons and a more modest inhibitory action on a smaller proportion of LDT cholinergic neurons. Given the roles played by these nuclei, these actions are consistent with acute pharmacologic effects of GHB: hypotonia and promotion of sleep, including presence of REM, a sub-state of sleep. Differences in GHB-mediated calcium suggest differential regulation of calcium-dependent processes, which may also contribute to functioning of the LDT and DR in state and motor control and the therapeutic pharmacologic actions of GHB, which develop following chronic administration. These findings add to knowledge of cellular actions of GHB and it is hoped that, combined with findings from other studies examining GHB neurotransmission, these data can contribute to development of highly targeted therapeutics at the GABAB receptor for management of human disorders presenting with alterations in motor and arousal control.

AB  - Abstract
S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) has been reported to protect against ischemic brain injury, however, the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of GSNO pre-treatment on the S-nitrosylation of Fas and subsequent events in the Fas pathway, and reveal the correlation between Fas S-nitrosylation and nNOS activation in the rat hippocampal CA1 region after global cerebral ischemia. The results showed that GSNO pre-treatment not only facilitated the survival of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, but also abolished the activation of pro-apoptotic Caspase-8, Bid, Caspase-9 and Caspase-3. The S-nitrosylation of Fas increased sustainedly after global ischemia, and GSNO blocked such an increase. Global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion promoted the binding between neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and postsynaptic density protein 95 that has been reported to activate nNOS, and GSNO inhibited the post-ischemic nNOS activation and NO release. A selective nNOS inhibitor 7-nitroindazole diminished the ischemia/reperfusion-induced Fas S-nitrosylation, suggesting a critical role of endogenous NO from nNOS activation in Fas S-nitrosylation. In addition, pre-administration of GSNO decreased the translocation of Fas to membrane, the formation of CD95hi on the membrane, the internalization of Fas aggregates to plasma, as well as the assembly of DISC/hiDISC. These results indicate that GSNO-induced nNOS inactivation associates with the down-regulation of Fas S-nitrosylation and consequent Fas signal cascade, which is responsible for the GSNO-mediated neuronal survival after brain ischemia. The understanding of GSNO neuroprotection provides a novel strategy to find potential therapeutic targets for ischemic stroke.

AB  - Abstract
In the adult rabbit and mouse retina, about 30% of the ON–OFF direction selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) are coupled via gap junctions. In early postnatal rabbit retinas, a greater proportion of morphological ON–OFF DSGCs shows coupling with a larger number of nearby somas. It is not clear whether the coupled ON–OFF DSGCs belong to the same subtype, or how coupling patterns change during development. In this study, we showed that in adult mouse retinas, all coupled ON–OFF DSGCs exhibited preferred directions (PDs) to superior, and this pattern emerged at postnatal day 15 (P15). At P13, the ON–OFF DSGCs with PDs to posterior were also coupled. Every ON–OFF DSGC in every subtype injected at P12 exhibited coupling. Therefore, a rapid decoupling process takes place in DSGCs around eye opening. Light deprivation delayed but did not halt the decoupling process. By using a transgenic mouse line in which green fluorescent protein (GFP) is selectively expressed in DSGCs with PDs to posterior and by performing in situ hybridization of cadherin-6, a marker for the DSGCs with PDs to superior and inferior, we showed that heterologous coupling existed between DSGCs with PDs to anterior and posterior till P12, but this heterologous coupling never spread to DSGCs positive for cadherin-6.

AB  - Abstract
Migraine attacks are typically described as unilateral, throbbing pain that is usually accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and exaggerated sensitivities to light, noise and smell. The headache phase of a migraine attack is mediated by activation of the trigeminovascular pathway; a nociceptive pathway that originates in the meninges and carries pain signals through meningeal nociceptors to the spinal trigeminal nucleus and from there to the cortex through relay neurons in the thalamus. Recent studies in our lab have identified a population of trigeminovascular neurons in the posterior (Po) and lateral posterior (LP) thalamic nuclei that may be involved in the perception of whole-body allodynia (abnormal skin sensitivity) and photophobia (abnormal sensitivity to light) during migraine. The purpose of the current study was to identify sub-cortical areas that are in position to directly regulate the activity of these thalamic trigeminovascular neurons. Such process begins with anatomical mapping of neuronal projections to the posterior thalamus of the rat by performing discrete injections of the retrograde tracer Fluorogold into the Po/LP region. Such injections yielded retrogradely labeled neurons in the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca, the dopaminergic cells group A11/A13, the ventromedial and ventral tuberomammillary nuclei of the hypothalamus. We also found that some of these neurons contain acetylcholine, dopamine, cholecystokinin and histamine, respectively. Accordingly, we speculate that these forebrain/hypothalamic projections to Po and LP may play a role in those migraine attacks triggered by disrupted sleep, skipping meals and emotional reactions.

AB  - Abstract
Estrogen receptors (ERs) α and β are involved in the regulation of the nitrergic system in the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei under basal conditions. In this study we have assessed whether ERs are also involved in the modulation of the nitrergic system in the SON and PVN under acute systemic hypertonic conditions. Adult ovariectomized rats received a single injection of either estradiol, a selective ERα agonist, a selective ERβ agonist, a selective ERα antagonist, a selective ERβ antagonist or vehicle. Twenty-four hours later, animals received one i.p. injection of 1.5 M NaCl to induce osmotic stress and were sacrificed after two additional hours. The number of NADPH-diaphorase-positive cells in the SON and PVN was determined. Their number in the SON was not affected by NaCl administration, whereas in the four PVN subdivisions it was decreased after NaCl administration. Estradiol and the ERα agonist prevented the action of NaCl in the four subdivisions of the PVN. In contrast, the inhibition of ERα enhanced the effect of NaCl, inducing a further decrease in the number of NADPH-diaphorase-positive cells. Moreover, the ERβ agonist enhanced and the ERβ antagonist blocked the effect of NaCl on the number of NADPH-diaphorase-positive neurons in the SON and in the medial magnocellular subdivision of the PVN. These findings indicate that estradiol regulates the nitrergic system in the SON and PVN under acute osmotic stress conditions, but the effects specifically depend on the anatomical subregions and different ERs.

AB  - Abstract
The loss of independent control of finger movements impairs the dexterous use of the hand. Focal hand dystonia is characterised by abnormal structural and functional changes at the cortical and subcortical regions responsible for individuated finger movements and by the loss of surround inhibition in the finger muscles. However, little is known about the pathophysiological impact of focal dystonia on the independent control of finger movements. Here we addressed this issue by asking pianists with and without focal dystonia to repetitively strike a piano key with one of the four fingers as fast as possible while the remaining digits kept the adjacent keys depressed. Using principal component analysis and cluster analysis to the derived keystroke data, we successfully classified pianists according to the presence or absence of dystonic symptoms with classification rates and cross-validation scores of approximately 90%. This confirmed the effects of focal dystonia on the individuated finger movements. Interestingly, the movement features that contributed to successful classification differed across fingers. Compared to healthy pianists, pianists with an affected index finger were characterised predominantly by stronger keystrokes, whereas pianists with affected middle or ring fingers exhibited abnormal temporal control of the keystrokes, such as slowness and rhythmic inconsistency. The selective alternation of the movement features indicates a finger-specific loss of the independent control of finger movements in focal dystonia of musicians.

AB  - Abstract
Immediate early transcription is an integral part of the neuronal response to environmental stimulation and serves many brain processes including development, learning, triggers of programmed cell death, and reaction to injury and drugs. Following a stimulus, neurons express a select few genes within a short period of time without undergoing de novo protein translation. Referred to as the ‘gateway to genetic response’, these immediate early genes (IEGs) are either expressed within a few minutes of stimulation or later within the hour. In neuronal IEGs that are expressed rapidly, productive elongation in response to neuronal activity is jump-started by constitutive transcription initiation together with RNA polymerase II stalling in the vicinity of the promoter. IEGs expressed later in the hour do not depend on this mechanism. On the basis of this Polymerase II poising, we propose that the immediate early genes can be grouped in two distinct classes: the rapid and the delayed IEGs. The possible biological relevance of these classes in neurons is discussed.

Adolescence is a period of significant neurobiological change that occurs as individuals transition from childhood to adulthood. Because the nervous system is in a relatively labile state during this stage of development, it may be especially sensitive to experience-induced plasticity. One such experience that is relatively common to adolescents is the exposure to drugs of abuse, particularly alcohol and psychostimulants. In this review, we highlight recent findings on the long-lasting effects of exposure to these drugs during adolescence in humans as well as in animal models. Whenever possible, our focus is on studies that use comparison groups of adolescent- and adult-exposed subjects as this is a more direct test of the hypothesis that adolescence represents a period of enhanced vulnerability to the effects of drug-induced plasticity. Lastly, we suggest areas of future investigation that are needed and methodological concerns that should be addressed.

Reproductive success depends on a robust and appropriately timed preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, which is induced by the activation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons in response to positive feedback from increasing estrogen levels. Here we document an increase in postsynaptic GluR2-lacking Ca2+-permeable AMPA-type glutamate receptors (CP-AMPARs) at synapses on GnRH neurons on the day of proestrus in rats, coincident with the increase in estrogen levels. Functional blockade of CP-AMPARs depressed the synaptic responses only on the day of proestrus and concomitantly attenuated the LH surge. Thus, the phasic synaptic incorporation of postsynaptic CP-AMPARs on GnRH neurons is involved in the generation of the LH surge.

The abilities of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and exercise to counteract cognitive decay after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is getting increasing recognition; however, the possibility that these actions can be complementary remains just as an intriguing possibility. Here we have examined the likelihood that the combination of diet and exercise has the added potential to facilitate functional recovery following TBI. Rats received mild fluid percussion injury (mFPI) or sham injury and then were maintained on a diet high in DHA (1.2% DHA) with or without voluntary exercise for 12 days. We found that FPI reduced DHA content in the brain, which was accompanied by increased levels of lipid peroxidation assessed using 4-hydroxy-2-hexenal (4-HHE). FPI reduced the enzymes acyl-CoA oxidase 1 (Acox1) and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 4 (17β-HSD4), and the calcium-independent phospholipases A2 (iPLA2), which are involved in metabolism of membrane phospholipids. FPI reduced levels of syntaxin-3 (STX-3), involved in the action of membrane DHA on synaptic membrane expansion, and also reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling through its tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) receptor. These effects of FPI were optimally counteracted by the combination of DHA and exercise. Our results support the possibility that the complementary action of exercise is exerted on restoring membrane homeostasis after TBI, which is necessary for supporting synaptic plasticity and cognition. It is our contention that strategies that take advantage of the combined applications of diet and exercise may have additional effects to the injured brain.

AB  - Abstract
Repeated exposure to drugs of abuse is associated with structural plasticity in brain reward pathways. Rats selectively bred for locomotor response to novelty differ on a number of neurobehavioral dimensions relevant to addiction. This unique genetic animal model was used here to examine both pre-existing differences and long-term consequences of repeated cocaine treatment on structural plasticity. Selectively bred high-responder (bHR) and low-responder (bLR) rats received repeated saline or cocaine injections for 9 consecutive days. Escalating doses of cocaine (7.5, 15 and 30 mg/kg) were administered on the first (day 1) and last (day 9) days of treatment and a single injection of the intermediate dose (15 mg/kg) was given on days 2–8. Motor activity in response to escalating doses of cocaine was compared on the first and last days of treatment to assess the acute and sensitized response to the drug. Following prolonged cocaine abstinence (28 days), spine density was examined on terminal dendrites of medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens core. Relative to bLRs, bHRs exhibited increased psychomotor activation in response to both the acute and repeated effects of cocaine. There were no differences in spine density between bHR and bLR rats under basal conditions or following repeated saline treatment. However, spine density differed markedly between these two lines following prolonged cocaine abstinence. All spine types were decreased in cocaine-treated bHRs, while only mushroom spines were decreased in bLRs that received cocaine. Changes in spine density occurred specifically near the branch point of terminal dendrites. These findings indicate that structural plasticity associated with prolonged cocaine abstinence varies markedly in two selected strains of rats that vary on numerous traits relevant to addiction. Thus, genetic factors that contribute to individual variation in the behavioral response to cocaine also influence cocaine-induced structural plasticity.

AB  - Abstract
There is mounting evidence that, in addition to texture and olfaction, taste plays a role in the detection of long chain fatty acids. Triglycerides, the main components of oils and dietary fat, are hydrolyzed in the mouth by a lingual lipase secreted from the von Ebner gland and the released free fatty acids are detected by the taste system. GPR40 and GPR120, two fatty acid responsive G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), are expressed in taste bud cells, and knockout mice lacking either of those receptors have blunted taste nerve responses to and reduced preference for fatty acids. Here we investigated whether activation of those GPCRs is sufficient to elicit fat taste and preference. Five non-fatty acid agonists of GPR40 and two non-fatty acid agonists of GPR120 activated the glossopharyngeal nerve of wild-type mice but not of knockout mice lacking the cognate receptor. In human subjects, two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC) tests, triangle tests and sensory profiling showed that non fatty acid agonists of GPR40 dissolved in water are detected in sip and spit tests and elicit a taste similar to that of linoleic acid, whereas 2-AFC tests showed that two agonists of GPR120 in water are not perceived fattier than water alone. Wild-type mice did not show any preference for five agonists of GPR40, two agonists of GPR120 and mixtures of both agonists over water in two-bottle preference tests. Together these data indicate that GPR40 mediated taste perception is not sufficient to generate preference.

AB  - Abstract
Wnt proteins have been implicated in regulating a variety of developmental processes in the CNS. Secreted Frizzled-related protein 3 (sFRP3) is a member of the sFRP family that can inhibit the Wnt signaling by binding directly to Wnts via their regions of homology to the Wnt-binding domain of Frizzleds. Recent studies suggested that sFRP3 plays an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation in various tissues. To understand the role of sFRP3 in neural development, we carried out detailed studies on the expression of sFRP3 in the developing nervous system. Our results revealed that sFRP3 is initially expressed in the ventricular zone of the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and later in the dorsal horn of spinal cord and subpopulation of DRG neurons. The spatiotemporally dynamic expression ofsFRP3 strongly suggests that sFRP3 has potential functions in the sensory neuron genesis and sensory circuitry formation.

AB  - Abstract
Deafness is a genetically complex disorder with many contributing genes still unknown. Here we describe the expression of Pitpnm1 in the inner ear. It is expressed in the inner hair cells of the organ of Corti from late embryonic stages until adulthood, and transiently in the outer hair cells during early postnatal stages. Despite this specific expression, Pitpnm1 null mice showed no hearing defects, possibly due to redundancy with the paralogous genes Pitpnm2 and Pitpnm3.

AB  - Abstract
This study investigated the effects of a long-term transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) treatment on cortical motor representation in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). In this double-blind crossover design, patients received either TENS or sham stimulation for 3 weeks (1 h per day) on the median nerve region of the most impaired hand, followed by the other stimulation condition after a washout period of 6 months. Cortical motor representation was mapped using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at the baseline and after the 3-week stimulation protocol. Our results revealed that 3 weeks of daily stimulation with TENS significantly decreased the cortical motor representation of the stimulated muscle in MS patients. Although the mechanisms underlying this decrease remain unclear, our findings indicate that TENS has the ability to induce long-term reorganization in the motor cortex of MS patients.

AB  - Abstract
Learning from feedback involves a network of various cortical and subcortical regions. Although activation in this network has been shown to be especially strong in successful learners, it is currently unclear which of these regions are related to within-subject variation in learning performance. To this aim, 21 subjects performed a probabilistic feedback-learning task consisting of multiple independent Learning blocks and non-learning Control blocks, while functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired. In agreement with previous studies, activation in anterior, lateral and medial left prefrontal cortex, insula and superior and inferior parietal cortical regions were found when contrasting Learning and Control blocks. Furthermore, activation in the supplementary motor area, anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral striatum was associated specifically with the learning phase and not the application phase during Learning blocks. Finally, activation only in the ventral striatum was associated with within-subject learning performance across the Learning blocks. Taken together, these latter two results are argued to provide the answer to the main research question: ventral striatum activation is associated with within-subject variations in learning performance. The ventral striatum appears to play a vital role in learning by adjusting behavior based on feedback.

AB  - Abstract
Numerous clinical conditions can be treated by neuromodulation of the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Typical electrical PNS therapies activate large diameter axons at lower electrical stimulus thresholds than small diameter axons. However, recent animal experiments with peripheral optogenetic neural stimulation (PONS) of myelinated axons expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) have shown that this technique activates small diameter axons at lower irradiances than large diameter axons. We hypothesized that the small-to-large diameter recruitment order primarily arises from the internodal spacing relationship of myelinated axons. Small diameter axons have shorter distances between their nodes of Ranvier, which increases the number of nodes of Ranvier directly illuminated relative to larger diameter axons. We constructed “light-axon” PONS models that included multi-compartment, double cable, myelinated axon models embedded with ChR2 membrane dynamics, coupled with a model of blue light dynamics in the tissue medium from a range of different light sources. The light-axon models enabled direct calculation of threshold irradiance for different diameter axons. Our simulations demonstrate that illumination of multiple nodal sections reduces the threshold irradiance and enhances the small-to-large diameter recruitment order. In addition to addressing biophysical questions, our light-axon model system could also be useful in guiding the engineering design of optical stimulation technology that could maximize the efficiency and selectivity of PONS.

AB  - Abstract
Developmental dyslexia, the most common childhood learning disorder, is highly heritable, and recent studies have identified KIAA0319-Like (KIAA0319L) as a candidate dyslexia susceptibility gene at the 1p36–34 (DYX8) locus. In this experiment, we investigated the anatomical effects of knocking down this gene during rat corticogenesis. Cortical progenitor cells were transfected using in utero electroporation on embryonic day (E) 15.5 with plasmids encoding either: (1) Kiaa0319l small hairpin RNA (shRNA), (2) an expression construct for human KIAA0319L, (3) Kiaa0319l shRNA + KIAA0319L expression construct (rescue), or (4) controls (scrambled Kiaa0319l shRNA or empty expression vector). Mothers were injected with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) at either E13.5, E15.5, or E17.5. Disruption of Kiaa0319l function (by knockdown, overexpression, or rescue) resulted in the formation of large nodular periventricular heterotopia in approximately 25% of the rats, which can be seen as early as postnatal day 1. Only a small subset of heterotopic neurons had been transfected, indicating non-cell autonomous effects of the transfection. Most heterotopic neurons were generated in mid- to late-gestation, and laminar markers suggest that they were destined for upper cortical laminae. Finally, we found that transfected neurons in the cerebral cortex were located in their expected laminae. These results indicate that KIAA0319L is the fourth of four candidate dyslexia susceptibility genes that is involved in neuronal migration, which supports the association of abnormal neuronal migration with developmental dyslexia.

AB  - Abstract
It is well known that neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) are involved in descending modulation of nociceptive transmission in the spinal cord. It has been shown that activation of neurokinin-1 receptors (NK-1Rs) in the RVM, which are presumably located on pain facilitating ON cells, produces hyperalgesia whereas blockade of NK-1Rs attenuates hyperalgesia. To obtain a better understanding of the functions of NK-1R expressing neurons in the RVM, we selectively ablated these neurons by injecting the stable analog of substance P (SP), Sar9,Met(O2)11-Substance P, conjugated to the ribosomal toxin saporin (SSP–SAP) into the RVM. Rats received injections of SSP–SAP (1 μM) or an equal volume of 1 μM of saporin conjugated to artificial peptide (Blank–SAP). Stereological analysis of NK-1R- and NeuN-labeled neurons in the RVM was determined 21–24 days after treatment. Withdrawal responses to mechanical and heat stimuli applied to the plantar hindpaw were determined 5–28 days after treatment. Withdrawal responses were also determined before and after intraplantar injection of capsaicin (acute hyperalgesia) or complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) (prolonged hyperalgesia).

The proportion of NK-1R-labeled neurons in the RVM was 8.8 ± 1.3% in naïve rats and 8.1 ± 0.8% in rats treated with Blank–SAP. However, injection of SSP–SAP into the RVM resulted in a 90% decrease in NK-1R-labeled neurons. SSP–SAP did not alter withdrawal responses to mechanical or heat stimuli under normal conditions, and did not alter analgesia produced by morphine administered into the RVM. In contrast, the duration of nocifensive behaviors produced by capsaicin and mechanical and heat hyperalgesia produced by capsaicin and CFA were decreased in rats pretreated with SSP–SAP as compared to those that received Blank–SAP.

These data support our earlier studies using NK-1R antagonists in the RVM and demonstrate that RVM neurons that possess the NK-1R do not play a significant role in modulating acute pain or morphine analgesia, but rather are involved in pain facilitation and the development and maintenance of hyperalgesia.

AB  - Abstract
Synaptic plasticity, specifically long-term potentiation and long-term depression, is thought to be the underlying cellular mechanism for learning and memory processes in the brain. About two decades ago a new concept was introduced, namely metaplasticity, which comprises changes that modify the properties of synaptic plasticity due to a priming or preconditioning event. While metaplasticity was initially defined and studied predominantly on a synaptic and cellular level, it soon became apparent that the term could also be very useful to describe plasticity changes on a more global level, including environmental stressors as priming events and altered behavior as outcome measures. We consider here whether it is helpful to conceptualize these latter effects as “behavioral metaplasticity”, and in which sense this view fits into the original concept of metaplasticity. By integrating the literature on environmental effects on plasticity, especially stress, plus developmental aspects as well as genetic and epigenetic modifications, we shape the framework in which the term “behavioral metaplasticity” should be considered and discuss research directions that can help to unravel the mechanisms involved in both synaptic and behavioral metaplasticity.

AB  - Abstract
Motor learning requires protein synthesis within the primary motor cortex (M1). Here, we show that the immediate early gene Arc/Arg3.1 is specifically induced in M1 by learning a motor skill.

Arc mRNA was quantified using a fluorescent in situ hybridization assay in adult Long–Evans rats learning a skilled reaching task (SRT), in rats performing reaching-like forelimb movement without learning (ACT) and in rats that were trained in the operant but not the motor elements of the task (controls). Apart from M1, Arc expression was assessed within the rostral motor area (RMA), primary somatosensory cortex (S1), striatum (ST) and cerebellum.

In SRT animals, Arc mRNA levels in M1 contralateral to the trained limb were 31% higher than ipsilateral (p &lt; 0.001), 31% higher than in the contralateral M1 of ACT animals (p &lt; 0.001) and 48% higher than in controls (p &lt; 0.001). Arc mRNA expression in SRT was positively correlated with learning success between two sessions (r = 0.52; p = 0.026). For RMA, S1, ST or cerebellum no significant differences in Arc mRNA expression were found between hemispheres or across behaviors.

As Arc expression has been related to different forms of cellular plasticity, these findings suggest a link between M1 Arc expression and motor skill learning in rats.

AB  - Abstract
LIN28, an RNA-binding protein, is known to be involved in the regulation of many cellular processes, such as embryonic stem cell proliferation, cell fate succession, developmental timing, and oncogenesis. In this study, we investigated the effect of constitutively expressing exogenous LIN28 on neuronal cell proliferation and viability in vitro. Plasmids containing LIN28–green fluorescent protein (GFP) or GFP were introduced into the embryonic mouse brains at E14.5 by in utero electroporation. Two days after electroporation, embryonic cortices were harvested and cultured. It was found that transfected cells stably overexpressed LIN28 in vitro. Viability curve from live cell imaging showed that the number of GFP-expressing cells decreased over time in line with naive primary cortical neurons. In contrast, the number of LIN28–GFP-overexpressing neurons initially increased and remained high at later time-points in culture than GFP-expressing cells. Double immunofluorescence showed that at an early time in culture, the number of Ki-67/GFP double-positive cells was higher in the LIN28–GFP group than that of controls. Moreover, there were significantly lower numbers of condensed nuclei/GFP- and cleaved caspase-3/GFP-positive cells in the LIN28–GFP groups compared to control GFP. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the LIN28–GFP-expressing cells at days in vitro (DIV)13 were neuronal nuclei (NeuN)-positive mature neurons. Finally, the expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) was induced in LIN28-expressing primary cortical neurons, which was not detected in controls. Taken together, our results indicate that the expression of exogenous LIN28 can promote the proliferation of neural progenitor cells and exert prosurvival effect on primary cortical neurons by inhibiting caspase-dependent apoptosis, possibly via upregulation of IGF-2.

AB  - Abstract
Recently, we have shown the expression of novel chemoreceptors corresponding to the olfactory receptor (OR) and taste receptor (TASR) families in the human brain. We have also shown dysregulation of ORs and TASRs in the cerebral cortex in Parkinson’s disease. The present study demonstrates the presence of OR mRNA and mRNA of obligated downstream components of OR signaling adenylyl cyclase 3 (ADYLC3) and olfactory G protein (Gnal) in the cerebral cortex of the mouse. Dysregulation of selected ORs and TASRs has been found in the entorhinal cortex and frontal cortex in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in a gradient compatible with Braak and Braak staging; frontal cortex in terminal stages of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy; and frontal cortex and cerebellum in Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease subtypes methionine/methionine at codón 129 of PRNP (MM1) and valine/valine at codón 129 of PRNP (VV2). Altered OR, ADYLC3 and Gnal mRNA expression with disease progression has also been found in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, used as a model of AD. The function of these orphan receptors is not known, but probably related to cell signaling pathways responding to unidentified ligands.

Variability in the drift, either down- or up-regulation, of dysregulated genes, suggests that central ORs and TASRs are vulnerable to variegated neurodegenerative diseases with cortical involvement, and that altered expression of ORs and TASRs is not a mere reflection of neuronal loss but rather a modulated pathological response.

AB  - Abstract
Proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β (IL1β) regulate both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. The interaction between IL1β and endocannabinoid system (ECS) is also emerging, based on the evidence that IL1β effects on striatal spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents are regulated by transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels, members of the ECS. Furthermore, IL1β has also been shown to control the sensitivity of cannabinoid CB1 receptors controlling GABA transmission (CB1Rs(GABA)) in the striatum.

To better detail the synaptic action of IL1β, and to clarify its complex interaction with the ECS, here we investigated the possible interplay between IL1β and CB1Rs controlling glutamate transmission (CB1Rs(glu)), other critical elements of the ECS. Our results show that the sensitivity of CB1Rs(glu) is fully blocked in the presence of IL1β in corticostriatal brain slices, and that the protein kinase C/TRPV1 pathway is involved in this effect. IL1β failed to modulate the sensitivity of glutamate synapses to the stimulation of GABAB receptors. We also provided evidence that IL1β–CB1Rs(GABA) but not IL1β–CB1Rs(glu) interaction is under the control of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/trkB signaling and of lipid raft composition, because BDNF gene partial deletion, pharmacological blockade of trkB and membrane cholesterol removal with methyl-β-cyclodextrin all blocked IL1β-mediated inhibition of CB1Rs(GABA) but left unaltered the sensitivity of CB1Rs(glu) to this cytokine.

Our results provide further evidence that synaptic transmission and the ECS are regulated by IL1β in the striatum.

AB  - AbstractBackground and Purpose
Peptide analog of thymulin (PAT) has been shown to have anti-hyperalgesic and anti-inflammatory properties in animal models of inflammation. Recent reports suggest that the peripheral cholinergic system has an anti-inflammatory role mediated by α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7-nAChR). Our aim is to investigate whether the action of PAT is mediated, via the cholinergic pathway.
Experimental Approach
The anti-hyperalgesic and anti-inflammatory action of PAT was assessed in rat models of inflammatory nociceptive hyperactivity (carrageenan and endotoxin) and in a mice air-pouch model for localized inflammation, respectively; the possible attenuation of PAT’s effects by pretreatment with the α7-nAchR specific antagonist methyllycaconitine citrate (MLA) was also investigated. In another series of experiments, using two electrode recordings, the effect of PAT on the α7-nAChRs, expressed in Xenopus Oocytes, was also determined.
Key Results
Administration of PAT reversed inflammatory nociceptive hyperactivity and cold and tactile hyperactivity in rats. This effect was partially or totally prevented by MLA, as assessed by different behavioral pain tests. Treatment with PAT also reduced the alteration of cytokines and NGF levels by carrageenan injection in the mouse air pouch model; this effect was partially antagonized by MLA. Electrophysiological recording demonstrated that PAT significantly potentiated the α7-nAchR expressed in Xenopus Oocytes. These effects were not observed when a control peptide, with a reverse sequence (rPAT), was utilized.
Conclusions and Implications
The behavioral and electrophysiological observations described in this report demonstrate that PAT mediates, at least partially, its anti-inflammatory action by potentiating the α7-nAChR. These results indicate that PAT has a potential for new therapeutic applications as anti-inflammatory and analgesic agent.

AB  - Abstract
Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) has been claimed to represent the most feared complication of treatment with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) therapy. In this study, we tested the effect of rosiglitazone on HT in a rat focal cerebral ischemia model. Male Sprague–Dawley rats received an injection of 50% dextrose (6 ml/kg intraperitoneally) and were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) 10 min later, with the regional cerebral blood flow monitored in vivo by laser-Doppler-flowmetry. Two groups were included: rosiglitazone treatment and vehicle group. In the treatment group, after 1.5 h of ischemia, rosiglitazone (2 mg/kg) was administered at the onset of reperfusion. Neurobehavioral scores, infarct volume, hemoglobin leakage, hemorrhage rate, the expression of collagen IV and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) were measured at 24 h after ischemia. Rosiglitazone improved neurobehavioral deficits, reduced infarct volume and hemorrhage rate, and inhibited hemoglobin leakage, when compared with the vehicle group. In addition, it increased the expression of collagen IV and GLUT1 compared to the vehicle group. Our results suggest that rosiglitazone attenuated the hyperglycemia-induced HT after MCAO, possibly by preservation of GLUT1 expression.

AB  - Compensatory counter-rotations of the eyes provoked by head turns are commonly attributed to the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). A recent study in guinea pigs demonstrates, however, that this assumption is not always valid. During voluntary head turns, guinea pigs make highly accurate compensatory eye movements that occur with zero or even negative latencies with respect to the onset of the provoking head movements. Furthermore, the anticipatory eye movements occur in animals with bilateral peripheral vestibular lesions, thus confirming that they have an extra vestibular origin. This discovery suggests the possibility that anticipatory responses might also occur in other species including humans and non-human primates, but have been overlooked and mistakenly identified as being produced by the VOR. This review will compare primate and guinea pig vestibular physiology in light of these new findings. A unified model of vestibular and cerebellar pathways will be presented that is consistent with current data in primates and guinea pigs. The model is capable of accurately simulating compensatory eye movements to active head turns (anticipatory responses) and to passive head perturbations (VOR induced eye movements) in guinea pigs and in human subjects who use coordinated eye and head movements to shift gaze direction in space.

Anticipatory responses provide new evidence and opportunities to study the role of extra vestibular signals in motor control and sensory–motor transformations. Exercises that employ voluntary head turns are frequently used to improve visual stability in patients with vestibular hypofunction. Thus, a deeper understanding of the origin and physiology of anticipatory responses could suggest new translational approaches to rehabilitative training of patients with bilateral vestibular loss.

AB  - Our aim was to evaluate continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) as a tool to induce temporary impairment (virtual lesion) in semantic processing.

Four groups with 20 subjects each were stimulated. In the three experimental groups the stimulation site was the left superior temporal cortex. Stimulation was either 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) at 100% resting motor threshold (RMT) or cTBS, with intensities of 80% or 90% active motor threshold (AMT). The TMS-control group was stimulated at the right medial prefrontal cortex with 1 Hz rTMS. After stimulation subjects accomplished a lexical decision task with a duration of about 20 min. In an additional fifth group the lexical decision task was performed without TMS.

Reaction times were not influenced by cTBS applied with 80% AMT, but prolonged for about 80 ms with 90% AMT compared to the no stimulation condition. An increase of 140 ms was found after 1 Hz rTMS. The effect lasted for the whole task, but declined from the first to the second half of the experiment.

The direct comparison of cTBS and 1 Hz rTMS suggests that both stimulation patterns can induce virtual lesions in the left superior temporal cortex and impair semantic processing. We suppose that cTBS could replace 1 Hz rTMS in this field since the application is faster and it is more comfortable to the subjects.

AB  - Increasing evidence suggests that altered arginine metabolism contributes to cognitive decline during ageing. Agmatine, decarboxylated arginine, has a variety of pharmacological effects, including the modulation of behavioural function. A recent study demonstrated the beneficial effects of short-term agmatine treatment in aged rats. The present study investigated how intraperitoneal administration of agmatine (40 mg/kg, once daily) over 4–6 weeks affected behavioural function and neurochemistry in aged Sprague–Dawley rats. Aged rats treated with saline displayed significantly reduced exploratory activity in the open field, impaired spatial learning and memory in the water maze and object recognition memory relative to young rats. Prolonged agmatine treatment improved animals’ performance in the reversal test of the water maze and object recognition memory test, and significantly suppressed age-related elevation in nitric oxide synthase activity in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. However, this prolonged supplementation was unable to improve exploratory activity and spatial reference learning and memory in aged rats. These findings further demonstrate that exogenous agmatine selectively improves behavioural function in aged rats.

AB  - The serine protease subtilisin-A produces a long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic potentials in hippocampal slices which differs mechanistically from classical LTD. Since caspases have been implicated in hippocampal plasticity, this study examined a possible role for these enzymes in subtilisin-induced LTD. Subtilisin produced a concentration-dependent decrease in the size of field excitatory synaptic potentials (fEPSPs), which was not prevented or modified by the caspase inhibitors Z-VAD(OMe)-fmk and Z-DEVD-fmk. Similarly Z-VAD(OMe)-fmk did not modify the selective loss of protein expression produced by subtilisin. Subtilisin reduced the expression of procaspase-3 and caspase-9 but, while caspase-9 was converted to its conventionally activated form (39 kDa), caspase-3 was metabolised along a non-canonical pathway to a 29/30 kDa protein rather than the classical 17/19 kDa fragments. Both Z-VAD(OMe)-fmk and Z-DEVD-fmk were unable to prevent the reduced expression of Postsynaptic Density Protein-95, Vesicle-Associated Membrane Protein-1 and Unco-ordinated 5H3 proteins produced by subtilisin, although MG132 did produce partial recovery from subtilisin-induced depression of fEPSPs. When tested on long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by theta stimulation in the stratum radiatum, MG132 inhibited the immediate increase in fEPSP size but generated a higher plateau LTP. Twin LTP stimulation generated a further increase in LTP amplitude in control slices but not in slices exposed to MG132. The results indicate that subtilisin does produce caspase activation but that this does not contribute to its induction of LTD. However, activation of the proteasome does contribute to subtilisin-induced LTD and may also play a modulatory role in electrically induced LTP.

AB  - Fibroblast growth loop (FGL) is a neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM)-mimetic peptide that mimics the interaction of NCAM with fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR). FGL increases neurite outgrowth and promotes neuronal survival in vitro, and it has also been shown to have neuroprotective effects in vivo. More recent evidence has indicated that FGL has anti-inflammatory effects, decreasing age-related changes in microglial activation and production of inflammatory cytokines. These changes have been associated with an FGL-induced increase in expression of the glycoprotein, CD200, which interacts with its receptor to help maintain microglia in a quiescent state. However whether the FGL-induced anti-inflammatory effects are CD200-dependent has not been examined. The objective of this study was to address this question. Mixed glia were prepared from brain tissue of neonatal wildtype and CD200-deficient mice and preincubated with FGL prior to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Cells were assessed for mRNA expression of markers of microglial activation, CD11b, CD40 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and also the inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, while supernatant concentrations of these cytokine were also assessed. LPS significantly increased all these parameters and the effect was greater in cells prepared from CD200-deficient mice. Whereas FGL attenuated the LPS-induced changes in cells from wildtype mice, it did not do so in cells from CD200-deficient mice. We conclude that the FGL-induced changes in microglial activation are CD200-dependent and demonstrate that the interaction of astrocytes with microglia is critically important for modulating microglial activation.

AB  - Women may be more vulnerable to certain stress-related psychiatric illnesses than men due to differences in hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenocortical (HPA) axis function. To investigate potential sex differences in forebrain regions associated with HPA axis activation in rats, these experiments utilized acute exposure to a psychological stressor. Male and female rats in various stages of the estrous cycle were exposed to 30 min of restraint, producing a robust HPA axis hormonal response in all animals, the magnitude of which was significantly higher in female rats. Although both male and female animals displayed equivalent c-fos expression in many brain regions known to be involved in the detection of threatening stimuli, three regions had significantly higher expression in females: the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), the anteroventral division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTav), and the medial preoptic area (MPOA). Dual fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of neurons containing c-fos and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) mRNA in these regions revealed significantly more c-fos and CRF single-labeled neurons, as well as significantly more double-labeled neurons in females. Surprisingly, there was no effect of the estrous cycle on any measure analyzed, and an additional experiment revealed no demonstrable effect of estradiol replacement following ovariectomy on HPA axis hormone induction following stress. Taken together, these data suggest sex differences in HPA axis activation in response to perceived threat may be influenced by specific populations of CRF neurons in key stress-related brain regions, the BSTav, MPOA, and PVN, which may be independent of circulating sex steroids.

AB  - Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in industrialized countries. Although surviving patients exhibit a certain degree of restoration of function attributable to brain plasticity, the majority of stroke survivors has to struggle with persisting deficits. In order to potentiate post-stroke recovery, several rehabilitation therapies have been undertaken and many experimental studies have reported that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is central to many facets of neuroplastic processes. However, although BDNF role in brain plasticity is well characterized through strategies that manipulate its content, the involvement of this neurotrophin in spontaneous post-stroke recovery remains to be clarified. Besides, while the neuroplastic role of BDNF is restricted to its mature form, most studies investigating the proper effect of ischemia on post-stroke BDNF metabolism focused on mRNA or total protein expressions. In addition, these studies are mainly performed in brain regions collected either at or around the lesion site. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate in both hemispheres, the long-term expression (up to one month) of both pro- and mature BDNF forms in rats subjected to photothrombotic ischemia. These assessments were performed in the cortex and in the hippocampus, two regions known to subserve functional recovery after stroke and were coupled to the study of synaptophysin expression, a marker of synaptogenesis. Our study reports that stroke induces an early and transient increase (4 h) in mature BDNF expression in the cortex of both hemispheres that was associated with a delayed rise (30 d) in synaptophysin levels ipsilateraly. In both hippocampal territories, the pattern of mature BDNF expression shows a more delayed increase (from 8 to 30 d), which coincides with the evolution of synaptophysin expression. Interestingly, in these hippocampal territories, pro-BDNF levels evolve differently suggesting a differential gene regulation between the two hemispheres. While highlighting the complexity of changes in BDNF metabolism after stroke, our data suggest that BDNF involvement in spontaneous post-stroke plasticity is region-dependent.

AB  - The sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) is a critical pathway by which sensory neurons sequester cytosolic Ca2+ and thereby maintain intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. We have previously demonstrated decreased intraluminal endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ concentration in traumatized sensory neurons. Here we examine SERCA function in dissociated sensory neurons using Fura-2 fluorometry. Blocking SERCA with thapsigargin (1 μM) increased resting [Ca2+]c and prolonged recovery (τ) from transients induced by neuronal activation (elevated bath K+), demonstrating SERCA contributes to control of resting [Ca2+]c and recovery from transient [Ca2+]c elevation. To evaluate SERCA in isolation, plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase was blocked with pH 8.8 bath solution and mitochondrial buffering was avoided by keeping transients small (⩽400 nM). Neurons axotomized by spinal nerve ligation (SNL) showed a slowed rate of transient recovery compared to control neurons, representing diminished SERCA function, whereas neighboring non-axotomized neurons from SNL animals were unaffected. Injury did not affect SERCA function in large neurons. Repeated depolarization prolonged transient recovery, showing that neuronal activation inhibits SERCA function. These findings suggest that injury-induced loss of SERCA function in small sensory neurons may contribute to the generation of pain following peripheral nerve injury.

AB  - Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is involved in central regulation of respiratory rhythm at the level of the medulla oblongata. The present study was carried out to test our hypothesis that H2S exerts site-specific regulatory action on respiratory rhythm in the medulla oblongata of neonatal rats. The rhythmic discharge of hypoglossal rootlets in medullary slices of neonatal rats was recorded. 200 μM NaHS (an H2S donor) increased burst frequency (BF) in 900-μm slices containing the pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC), whereas it caused diphasic responses in 1200-, 1400- and 1800-μm slices containing both the preBötC and part or all of the parafacial respiratory group (pFRG): an initial decrease in BF followed by an increase. The initial decrease in BF was no longer observed after unilateral lesion of the pFRG region in the 1400-μm slices. In addition, BF was increased by a unilateral micro-injection of NaHS into the preBötC region, but was decreased by an injection into the pFRG region. These data support our hypothesis that the regulatory action of H2S on respiratory rhythm in the medulla oblongata is site-specific. The excitatory effect is caused by the preBötC, while the inhibitory effect is from the pFRG.

AB  - Neonatal ventral hippocampus (NVH)-lesioned rats represent a neurodevelopmental impairment model of schizophrenia. Previous observations indicate that postpubertal NVH-lesioned rats exhibit impairments in prepulse inhibition (PPI), spontaneous locomotion and social interaction behavior. Here, we document the neurochemical basis of those defects. PPI impairment but not cognitive impairment was improved by acute risperidone treatment (0.30 mg/kg i.p.). Immunohistochemical analyses using anti-autophosphorylated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) antibody indicated significantly reduced CaMKII autophosphorylation, especially in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), striatum and hippocampal CA1 region, of NVH-lesioned rats relative to control animals. We also confirmed that reduced CaMKII autophoshorylation in the mPFC, striatum and hippocampal CA1 region causes decreased phosphorylation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolpropionic acid-type glutamate receptor subunit 1 (GluR1) (Ser 831), a CaMKII substrate. Like CaMKII, PKCα (Ser 657) autophosphorylation and NR1 (Ser 896) phosphorylation were decreased both in the mPFC and CA1 region. Interestingly, phosphorylation of DARPP-32 (Thr 34) was decreased in the mPFC but increased in the striatum and CA1 region of NVH-lesioned rats compared to controls. Risperidone treatment restored increased DARPP-32 phosphorylation in the striatum and CA1 regions of NVH-lesioned rats but did not rescue CaMKII and PKCα autophosphorylation. Taken together, we find that impaired cognition observed in NVH-lesioned rats is associated with decreased CaMKII and PKCα activities in memory-related brain regions, changes not rescued by risperidone treatment.

AB  - Background
The phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) promotes primary afferent sensitization. The role of p38MAPK signaling in the DRG in the pathogenesis of plantar incision hyperalgesia has not been investigated.
Results
Levels of phosphorylated p38MAPK (p-p38MAPK) obviously increased in the DRG after plantar incision. Unmyelinated and myelinated DRG neurons that express p-p38MAPK contained small to medium cell bodies, suggesting that p-p38MAPK expression is induced in neurons with C- and Aδ-fibers. The p-p38MAPK inhibitors FR167653 or SB203580 inhibited incision-induced mechanical hypersensitivity and spontaneous pain behavior. The systemic administration of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitor prevented subsequent incision-induced activation of p38MAPK in the DRG and alleviated mechanical hypersensitivity after the incision.
Conclusions
p38MAPK signaling in the DRG plays a crucial role in the development of primary afferent sensitization and pain behavior caused by plantar incision.

AB  - Infection during early neonatal period has been shown to cause lasting neurological disabilities and is associated with the subsequent impairment in development of learning and memory ability and anxiety-related behavior in adults. We have previously reported that neonatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure resulted in cognitive deficits in juvenile rats (P21); thus, the goal of the present study was to determine whether neonatal LPS exposure has long-lasting effects in adult rats. After an LPS (1 mg/kg) intracerebral (i.c.) injection in postnatal day 5 (P5) Sprague–Dawley female rat pups, neurobehavioral tests were carried out on P21 and P22, P49 and P50 or P70 and P71 and brain injury was examined at 66 days after LPS injection (P71). Our data indicate that neonatal LPS exposure resulted in learning deficits in the passive avoidance task, less anxiety-like (anxiolytic-like) responses in the elevated plus-maze task, reductions in the hippocampal volume and the number of neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN)+ cells, as well as axonal injury in the CA1 region of the middle dorsal hippocampus in P71 rats. Neonatal LPS exposure also resulted in sustained inflammatory responses in the P71 rat hippocampus, as indicated by an increased number of activated microglia and elevation of interleukin-1β content in the rat hippocampus. This study reveals that neonatal LPS exposure causes persistent injuries to the hippocampus and results in long-lasting learning disabilities, and these effects are related to the chronic inflammation in the rat hippocampus.

AB  - Childhood bullying or social stress in adolescent humans is generally considered to increase the risk of developing behavioral disorders like depression in adulthood. Juveniles are hypothesized to be particularly sensitive to stressors in their environment due to the relatively late maturation of brain areas that are targeted by stress such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. In our study male adolescent rats were subjected to repeated social defeat on postnatal day (PND) 28, 31 and 34 (experiment 1) or to daily social defeats between PND 35 and 42 (experiment 2). Adolescent rats in experiment 1 were socially housed in pairs with a male of similar age during and after the social defeat. In experiment 2 adolescents were housed either alone or with an age-mate for 7 days (PND 35–42) next to either a highly aggressive or a non-aggressive adult male neighbor with whom a repeated physical interaction was allowed. In experiment 1 the adolescent defeats affected subsequent play behavior with the cage mate. Socially stressed rats more frequently initiated play behavior but also adopted more frequently submissive postures during the play fights. As adults, they seemed to cope behaviorally and physiologically better with a similar exposure to a residential aggressive male rat than unstressed controls. In experiment 2 acute effects of adolescent social stress were studied on neuroplasticity markers like hippocampal cell proliferation and neurogenesis as well as hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. The 2nd experiment also studied long-term effects of the adolescent stress in the response to an adult social defeat. A few acute but minor changes in brain plasticity markers and behavior were observed but these were transient and no behavioral or physiological effects persisted into adulthood. The results from both experiments support the theory developed in the so-called “match–mismatch hypothesis” which claims that the final consequence of childhood adversity depends on how well the early life environment matches the challenges in later life. Socially stressed adolescents are rather resilient to the lasting behavioral and physiological effects of the stress exposure if they are socially housed afterward and have the ability to recover.

AB  - Associative learning can occur under anesthesia and its neural correlates have begun to be elucidated. During discrimination learning under anesthesia in rats, lateral amygdala excitability increases in response to a conditioned stimulus (CS+) previously paired with electrical stimulation of the paw but not to another stimulus presented alone (CS−). Similarly, medial prefrontal cortex activity increases selectively during CS+ presentation after discrimination learning but this occurs only in neurons receiving input from the basolateral amygdala (BLA), the main source of amygdaloid projections to this region. However, BLA activity during discrimination learning under anesthesia has not been investigated. Here we used in vivo electrophysiology to examine BLA activity before and after associative learning and during later memory retrieval in anesthetized rats. We examined extracellular unit and local field potential (LFP) activity using an auditory discrimination learning paradigm. Rats were repeatedly presented with two distinct sounds, one of which was paired with electrical stimulation of the paw. One hour later, the paired sound (CS+) was presented alone along with the sound not paired with electrical stimulation (CS−). We found increased unit firing late (1 h) but not early (5 min) after learning. LFP power was increased both early and late after learning. In control experiments we also found increased unit and LFP activity late after electrical stimulation alone. After discrimination learning, unit firing increased in response to CS+, but not CS−, presentation. LFP power also showed a modest increase during CS+, compared to CS−, presentation. These findings suggest that discrimination learning under anesthesia can occur at the neural level in BLA. The potential relevance of these results is discussed in relation to previous studies examining neural activity during fear learning and memory processing in conscious animals.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the updating process of internal models of action in children and young adults, through the postural and motor strategies adopted in simple tasks, namely sit-to-stand (STS) and back-to-sit (BTS). To this end, 11 healthy children from 7 to 10 years (latest stage of childhood) and 12 healthy adults participated in the experiment. The STS and BTS tasks were performed with horizontal support surface and support surface tilted 10° to the right or forward in order to investigate the immediate adaptation of the internal representations of the movement. Movement variables that included the durations of STS and BTS and the amplitudes of the trunk movement were computed. Postural characteristics were also considered during the transition from STS to BTS, including the trunk orientation and the head stabilization strategies. Despite certain similarities with adults, especially in terms of the asymmetry of the performance times for the two tasks (STS vs. BTS) and the partial movement adaptations, the children were less able than adults to adapt both postural and movement controls to the new support conditions. Thus, it appears that the updating of internal models of action is a process that matures slowly throughout ontogenesis.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that running exercise could increase regional cerebral blood flow. There have been previous studies investigating the effects of running exercise on capillary density in the brain and showing that running exercise could induce brain angiogenesis. However, there have been no studies investigating the effects of running exercise on the total volume, total length and total surface area of the capillaries in the cortex. Moreover, sex differences in the effects of running exercise on the capillaries of the cortex have not previously been investigated. The current study was designed to investigate the effects of running exercise on the capillaries in the cortex of middle-aged rats using the new unbiased stereological methods. The present study found that the total length and total surface area of the capillaries in the cortex of running middle-aged female rats were significantly increased, compared to control rats. Our results also reveal that there are sex differences in the effects of running exercise on the capillaries in the cortex of middle-aged rats. These results demonstrate that exercise-induced increases of the capillaries in the female rat cortex might be one of the structural bases for the exercise-induced improvement in the spatial learning capacity of middle-aged female rats. These results provide a baseline for further studies that search for strategies to delay the deleterious effects of brain aging.

AB  - Epigenetic mechanisms play an important role in memory formation and synaptic plasticity. Specifically, histone-associated heterochromatin undergoes changes in structure during the early stages of long-term memory formation. In keeping with the classical conditioning paradigm, young rats have been shown to exhibit aversion to an odor stimulus initially presented during foot shock. We previously showed that synaptic plasticity at the dendrodendritic synapses between mitral and granule cells in the olfactory bulb (OB) underlies this aversive olfactory learning. However, the epigenetic mechanisms involved are not well characterized. Therefore, we examined whether intrabulbar infusion of trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, facilitates olfactory learning in young rats. TSA infusion during odor-shock training enhanced a conditioned odor aversion in a dose-dependent manner and prolonged the learned aversion. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses showed that the level of histone H4 acetylation significantly increased until 4 h after odor-shock training in both mitral and granule cells in the OB, whereas histone H3 acetylation returned to the control level at 2 h after the training. We also obtained evidence that TSA infusion elevated acetylation of histone H4 or H3. Furthermore, in vitro electrophysiological analysis using slices of the OB revealed that application of TSA significantly enhanced the long-term potentiation induced in synaptic transmission from mitral to granule cells at dendrodendritic synapses. Taken together, these results provide evidence that histone H4 and H3 acetylation in the OB is an epigenetic mechanism associated with aversive olfactory learning in young rats.

AB  - Steroid hormones, including those produced by the gonads and the adrenal glands, are known to influence brain development during sensitive periods of life. Until recently, most brain organisation was assumed to take place during early stages of development, with relatively little neurogenesis or brain re-organisation during later stages. However, an increasing body of research has shown that the developing brain is also sensitive to steroid hormone exposure during adolescence (broadly defined as the period from nutritional independence to sexual maturity). In this review, we examine how steroid hormones that are produced by the gonads and adrenal glands vary across the lifespan in a range of mammalian and bird species, and we summarise the evidence that steroid hormone exposure influences behavioural and brain development during early stages of life and during adolescence in these two taxonomic groups. Taking a cross-species, comparative perspective reveals that the effects of early exposure to steroid hormones depend upon the stage of development at birth or hatching, as measured along the altricial–precocial dimension. We then review the evidence that exposure to stress during adolescence impacts upon the developing neuroendocrine systems, the brain and behaviour. Current research suggests that the effects of adolescent stress vary depending upon the sex of the individual and type of stressor, and the effects of stress could involve several neural systems, including the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems. Experience of stressors during adolescence could also influence brain development via the close interactions between the stress hormone and gonadal hormone axes. While sensitivity of the brain to steroid hormones during early life and adolescence potentially leaves the developing organism vulnerable to external adversities, developmental plasticity also provides an opportunity for the developing organism to respond to current circumstances and for behavioural responses to influence the future life history of the individual.

AB  - Abstract
We assessed the effect of 3 h of environmental enrichment (EE) exposure per day started at different ages (3 and 18 months old) on the performance in a spatial memory task and on brain regions involved in the spatial learning (SPL) process using the principal component analysis (PCA). The animals were tested in the four-arm radial water maze (4-RAWM) for 4 days, with six daily trials. We used cytochrome c oxidase (COx) histochemistry to determine the brain oxidative metabolic changes related to age, SPL and EE. Behavioural results showed that the enriched groups, regardless of their age, achieved better performance in the spatial task. Interestingly, in the case of the distance travelled in the 4-RAWM, the effect of the EE was dependent on the age, so the young enriched group travelled a shorter distance compared to the aged enriched group. Respect to COx histochemistry results, we found that different brain mechanisms are triggered in aged rats to solve the spatial task, compared to young rats. PCA revealed the same brain functional network in both age groups, but the contribution of the brain regions involved in this network was slightly different depending on the age of the rats. Thus, in the aged group, brain regions involved in anxiety-like behaviour, such as the amygdala or the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis had more relevance; whereas in the young enriched group the frontal and the hippocampal subregions had more contribution.

AB  - Abstract
Both tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and the angiotensin (Ang) II/angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) axis play important roles in neuropathic pain and nociception. In the present study, we explored the interaction between the two systems by examining the mutual effects between TNF-α and the Ang II/AT1 receptor axis in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Rat DRG neurons were treated with TNF-α in different concentrations for different lengths of time in the presence or absence of transcription inhibitor actinomycin D, TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) inhibitor SPD304, β-catenin signaling inhibitor CCT031374, or different kinase inhibitors. TNF-α decreased the AT1 receptor mRNA level as well as the AT1a receptor promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner within 30 h, which led to dose-dependent inhibition of Ang II-binding AT1 receptor level on the cell membrane. Actinomycin D (1 mg/ml), SPD304 (50 μM), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor PD169316 (25 μM), and CCT031374 (50 μM) completely abolished the inhibitory effect of TNF-α on AT1 receptor expression. TNF-α dose-dependently increased soluble β-catenin and phosphorylated GSK-3β levels, which was blocked by SPD304 and PD169316. In DRG neurons treated with AT2 receptor agonist CGP421140, or Ang II with or without AT1 receptor antagonist losartan or AT2 receptor antagonist PD123319 for 30 h, we found that Ang II and Ang II + PD123319 significantly decreased TNF-α expression, whereas CPG421140 and Ang II + losartan increased TNF-α expression. In conclusion, we demonstrate that TNF-α inhibits AT1 receptor expression at the transcription level via TNFR1 in rat DRG neurons by increasing the soluble β-catenin level through the p38 MAPK/GSK-3β pathway. In addition, Ang II appears to inhibit and induce TNF-α expression via the AT1 receptor and the AT2 receptor in DRG neurons, respectively. This is the first evidence of crosstalk between TNF-α and the Ang II/AT receptor axis in DRG neurons.

The senses of hearing and balance in vertebrates are transduced by hair cells in the inner ear. Hair cells from a wide variety of organisms have been described electrophysiologically but this is the first report of the application of these techniques to the genetically tractable zebrafish model system. Auditory and vestibular hair cells isolated from zebrafish lagenae and utricles were patch clamped and both inward and outward currents under voltage clamp, and changes in membrane potential under current clamp were recorded. Cells displayed substantial diversity in their morphology, constellation of channel types, and level of excitability. While all cells showed evidence of the presence of fast-inactivating (A-type) K+ channels, other K+ channel types, including delayed rectifier, inward rectifier and large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels were less common. Recorded Ca2+ currents were identified pharmacologically as L-type. Non-linear regenerative voltage responses were evoked in more than half of the cells studied.

AB  - Abstract
Our prior research has shown that the transcription of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress transcription factors activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) and ATF4 are induced by amphetamine and restraint stress in rat striatum. However, presently the full extent of ER stress responses to psychological stress or cocaine, and which of the three ER stress pathways is activated is unknown. The current study examines transcriptional responses of key ER stress target genes subsequent to psychological stress or cocaine. Rats were subjected to acute or repeated restraint stress or cocaine treatment and mRNA was isolated from dorsal striatum, medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens brain tissue. ER stress gene mRNA expression was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and RNA sequencing. Restraint stress and cocaine-induced transcription of the classic ER stress-induced genes (BIP, CHOP, ATF3 and GADD34) and of two other ER stress components x-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) and ATF6. In addition, rats living in an enriched environment (large group cage with novel toys changed daily) exhibited rapid induction of GADD34 and ATF3 after 30 min of exploring novel toys, suggesting these genes are also involved in normal non-pathological signaling. However, environmental enrichment, a paradigm that produces protective addiction and depression phenotypes in rats, attenuated the rapid induction of ATF3 and GADD34 after restraint stress. These experiments provide a sensitive measure of ER stress and, more importantly, these results offer good evidence of the activation of ER stress mechanisms from psychological stress, cocaine and natural reward. Thus, ER stress genes may be targets for novel therapeutic targets for depression and addiction.

AB  - Abstract
Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common single-gene inherited form of intellectual disability with behaviors characteristic of autism. People with FXS display childhood seizures, hyperactivity, anxiety, developmental delay, attention deficits, and visual-spatial memory impairment, as well as a propensity for obsessive–compulsive disorder. Several of these aberrant behaviors and FXS-associated synaptic irregularities also occur in “fragile X mental retardation gene” knock-out (Fmr1 KO) mice. We previously reported that minocycline promotes the maturation of dendritic spines – postsynaptic sites for excitatory synapses – in the developing hippocampus of Fmr1 KO mice, which may underlie the beneficial effects of minocycline on anxiolytic behavior in young Fmr1 KO mice. In this study, we compared the effectiveness of minocycline treatment in young and adult Fmr1 KO mice, and determined the dependence of behavioral improvements on short-term versus long-term minocycline administration. We found that 4- and 8-week-long treatments significantly reduced locomotor activity in both young and adult Fmr1 KO mice. Some behavioral improvements persisted in young mice post-treatment, but in adults the beneficial effects were lost soon after minocycline treatment was stopped. We also show, for the first time, that minocycline treatment partially attenuates the number and severity of audiogenic seizures in Fmr1 KO mice. This report provides further evidence that minocycline treatment has immediate and long-lasting benefits on FXS-associated behaviors in the Fmr1 KO mouse model.

AB  - Abstract
Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are densely expressed in the brain with ASIC1a and ASIC2 channels being the predominant subtypes. These channels are enriched at synaptic sites and are central for the regulation of normal synaptic transmission. Moreover, increasing evidence links ASICs to the pathogenesis of various neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study, we explore the putative role of ASIC1a and ASIC2 in the regulation of behavioral sensitivity to the psychostimulant cocaine by utilizing ASIC1a or ASIC2 knockout mice. Acute cocaine injection induced a typical dose-dependent increase in locomotor activities in wild-type (WT) mice. However, in ASIC1a and ASIC2 mutant mice, different motor responses to cocaine were observed. In ASIC1a−/− mice, cocaine induced a significantly less motor response at all doses (5, 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg), while in ASIC2−/− mice, cocaine (5–20 mg/kg) stimulated locomotor activity to an extent comparable to WT mice. Only at 30 mg/kg, the cocaine-stimulated motor activity was reduced in ASIC2−/− mice. In a chronic cocaine administration model (20 mg/kg, once daily for 5 days), a challenge injection of cocaine (10 mg/kg, after 2-week withdrawal) caused an evident behavioral sensitization in the cocaine-pretreated WT mice. This behavioral sensitization to challenge cocaine was also displayed in ASIC1a−/− and ASIC2−/− mice. However, ASIC2−/− mice showed less sensitization to challenge cocaine when compared to WT and ASIC1a−/− mice. Our results demonstrate the important role of ASIC1a and ASIC2 channels in the modulation of behavioral sensitivity to cocaine. The two synapse-enriched ASIC subtypes are believed to play distinguishable roles in the regulation of behavioral responses to acute and chronic cocaine administration.

AB  - Abstract
Mounting evidence indicates that inflammatory cytokines contribute to the development of depression in both medically ill and medically healthy individuals. Cytokines are important for development and normal brain function, and have the ability to influence neurocircuitry and neurotransmitter systems to produce behavioral alterations. Acutely, inflammatory cytokine administration or activation of the innate immune system produces adaptive behavioral responses that promote conservation of energy to combat infection or recovery from injury. However, chronic exposure to elevated inflammatory cytokines and persistent alterations in neurotransmitter systems can lead to neuropsychiatric disorders and depression. Mechanisms of cytokine behavioral effects involve activation of inflammatory signaling pathways in the brain that results in changes in monoamine, glutamate, and neuropeptide systems, and decreases in growth factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Furthermore, inflammatory cytokines may serve as mediators of both environmental (e.g. childhood trauma, obesity, stress, and poor sleep) and genetic (functional gene polymorphisms) factors that contribute to depression’s development. This review explores the idea that specific gene polymorphisms and neurotransmitter systems can confer protection from or vulnerability to specific symptom dimensions of cytokine-related depression. Additionally, potential therapeutic strategies that target inflammatory cytokine signaling or the consequences of cytokines on neurotransmitter systems in the brain to prevent or reverse cytokine effects on behavior are discussed.

AB  - Abstract
The olfactory bulb (OB) has been recently identified as a circadian oscillator capable of operating independently of the master circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus. OB oscillations manifest as rhythms in clock genes, electrical activity, and odor sensitivity. Dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin have been shown to modulate olfactory information processing by the OB and may be part of the mechanism that underlies diurnal changes in olfactory sensitivity. Rhythmic release of these neurotransmitters could generate OB rhythms in electrical activity and olfactory sensitivity. We hypothesized that these monoamines were rhythmically released in the OB. To test our hypotheses, we examined monoamine levels in the OB, over the course of a day, by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrochemical detection. We observed that dopamine and its metabolite, 3-4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, rhythmically fluctuate over the day. In contrast, norepinephrine is arrhythmic. Serotonin and its metabolite hydroxyindoleacetic acid appear to rhythmically fluctuate. Each of these monoamines has been shown to alter OB circuit behavior and influence odor processing. Rhythmic release of serotonin may be a mechanism by which the suprachiasmatic nuclei communicate, indirectly, with the OB.

AB  - Abstract
Various protein motifs play a key role in regulating protein biogenesis and trafficking. Here, we discovered that three distinct motifs regulate the trafficking of acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a), the primary neuronal proton receptor which plays critical roles in neurological diseases including stroke, multiple sclerosis and seizures. Mutating the PDZ binding motif of ASIC1a increased its surface expression and current density. In contrast, mutating either a RRGK motif or a KEAKR motif reduced ASIC1a surface expression and acid-activated current density. Mutating or deleting the RRGK motif also reduced pH sensitivity and the rate of desensitization of ASIC1a. These changes were likely due to a change in ASIC1a biogenesis; mutating either the RRGK or KEAKR motif reduced N-glycosylation of ASIC1a while mutating the PDZ binding motif had the opposite effect. Our results demonstrate that these C-terminal motifs are important for ASIC1a trafficking and channel function. In addition, in contrast to multiple previous studies, which all show that K/R containing motifs lead to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention, our findings indicate that these motifs can also be required for efficient trafficking.

AB  - Abstract
The parasympathetic control of heart rate arises from premotor cardiac vagal neurons (CVNs) located in the nucleus ambiguus (NA). Previous microinjection studies in NA show that dopamine evokes a decrease in heart rate, but the underlying mechanisms responsible for these responses were not identified. This study tested whether dopamine modulates inhibitory GABAergic and glycinergic and/or excitatory glutamatergic neurotransmission to CVNs. Retrogradely labeled CVNs were identified in an in vitro rat brainstem slice preparation and synaptic events were recorded using whole cell voltage clamp techniques.

Bath application of dopamine (100 μM) had no effect on excitatory synaptic events, but reversibly inhibited the frequency (but not amplitude) of GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in CVNs. Similarly, dopamine (10 μM and 100 μM) inhibited glycinergic IPSC frequency by ∼50% and 70% respectively. The reduction in inhibitory neurotransmission to CVNs by dopamine was prevented by the sodium channel blocker TTX (1 μM) indicating that the dopamine mediated effects were action potential dependent. Dopamine evoked responses were mimicked by the D2-like receptor agonist, Quinpirole but not D1-like receptor agonist, SKF 38393. In addition, the dopamine mediated depression of inhibitory synaptic responses were prevented by the D2-like receptor antagonist sulpiride, but not by D1-like or adrenergic or serotonergic receptor antagonists, suggesting that these responses were D2-like receptor mediated and not D1-like or adrenergic or 5-HT receptor mediated. These data suggest that dopamine acts via dis-inhibition, and diminishes inhibitory GABAergic and glycinergic neurotransmission to CVNs, which would be predicted to increase parasympathetic activity to the heart and evoke a bradycardia.

AB  - Abstract
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become the standard surgical procedure for advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD). Recently, the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPN) has emerged as a potential target for DBS in patients whose quality of life is compromised by freezing of gait and falls. To date, only a few groups have published their long-term clinical experience with PPN stimulation. Bearing in mind that the Barrington (Bar) nucleus and some adjacent nuclei (also known as the micturition centre) are close to the PPN and may be affected by DBS, the aim of the present study was to review the anatomical location of this structure in human and other species. To this end, the Bar nucleus area was analysed in mouse, monkey and human tissues, paying particular attention to the anatomical position in humans, where it has been largely overlooked. Results confirm that anatomical location renders the Bar nucleus susceptible to influence by the PPN DBS lead or to diffusion of electrical current. This may have an undesirable impact on the quality of life of patients.

AB  - Abstract
The regulation of D3 receptor has not been well documented in diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD). In this study, a novel D3-preferring radioligand [3H]WC-10 and a D2-preferring radioligand [3H]raclopride were used and the absolute densities of the dopamine D3 and D2 receptors were determined in the striatal regions and substantia nigra (SN) from postmortem brains from five cases of DLBD, which included dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n = 4) and Parkinson disease dementia (PDD, n = 1). The densities of the dopamine D1 receptor, vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), and dopamine transporter (DAT) were also measured by quantitative autoradiography using [3H]SCH23390, [3H]dihydrotetrabenazine, and [3H]WIN35428, respectively. The densities of these dopaminergic markers were also measured in the same brain regions in 10 age-matched control cases. Dopamine D3 receptor density was significantly increased in the striatal regions including caudate, putamen and nucleus accumbens (NAc). There were no significant changes in the dopamine D1 and D2 receptor densities in any brain regions measured. VMAT2 and DAT densities were reduced in all the brain regions measured in DLB/PDD, however, the significant reduction was found in the putamen for DAT and in the NAc and SN for VMAT2. The decrease of dopamine pre-synaptic markers implies neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) in these DLB/PDD cases, while the increase of D3 receptors in striatal regions could be attributed to dopaminergic medication history and psychiatric states such as hallucinations. Whether it also reflects compensatory regulation upon dopaminergic denervation warrants further confirmations on larger populations.

AB  - Abstract
Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) induces demyelination in susceptible strains of mice through a CD4+ Th1 T cell-mediated immunopathological process. TMEV infection produces a syndrome in mice that resembles multiple sclerosis. In this work, we focused on the increased expression of the genes encoding voltage-gated Ca2+ channel subunits in SJL/J mouse astrocytes infected in culture with a BeAn strain of TMEV. Affymetrix DNA murine genome U74v2 DNA microarray hybridized with cRNA from mock- and TMEV-infected astrocytes revealed the upregulation of four sequences encoding Ca2+-binding and Ca2+ channel subunit proteins. The DNA hybridization results were further validated using conventional RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR, demonstrating the increased expression of mRNA encoding channel subunit proteins. Western blotting also showed the increased synthesis of L- and N-type channel subunit specific proteins after infection. The reduced expression and the functional upregulation of functional voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in mock- and TMEV-infected cells, respectively, was demonstrated using voltage clamp experiments. TMEV infection in mouse astrocytes induced a Ca2+ current with a density proportional to the amount of viral particles used for infection. The use of Ca2+ channel blockers, nimodipine and ω-conotoxin-GVIA, showed that both functional L- and N-type Ca2+ channels were upregulated in infected astrocytes. The upregulation of Ca2+ channels in astrocytes after TMEV infection provides insight into the molecular processes and potential role of astrocyte Ca2+ dysregulation in the pathophysiology of encephalomyelitis and is important for the development of novel therapeutic strategies leading to prevention of neurodegeneration.

AB  - Abstract
There is high comorbidity between stress-related psychiatric disorders and addiction, suggesting they may share one or more common neurobiological mechanisms. Because of its role in both depressive and addictive behaviors, the galanin system is a strong candidate for such a mechanism. In this study, we tested if galanin and its receptors are involved in stress-associated behaviors and drug addiction. Mice were exposed to 21 days of chronic restraint stress (CRS); subsequently, mRNA levels of galanin, galanin receptors (GalRs), the rate-limiting enzymes for the synthesis of monoamines, and monoamine autoreceptors were measured in the nucleus accumbens by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Moreover, we tested the effects of this stress on morphine-induced addictive behaviors. We found that CRS induced anxiety and depression-like behaviors, impaired the formation and facilitated the extinction process in morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP), and also blocked morphine-induced behavioral sensitization. These behavioral results were accompanied by a CRS-dependent increase in the mRNA expression of galanin, GalR1, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), tryptophan hydroxylase 2, and 5-HT1B receptor. Interestingly, treatment with a commonly used antidepressant, fluoxetine, normalized the CRS-induced behavioral changes based on reversing the higher expression of galanin and TH while increasing the expression of GalR2 and α2A-adrenceptor. These results indicate that activating the galanin system, with corresponding changes to noradrenergic systems, following chronic stress may modulate stress-associated behaviors and opiate addiction. Our findings suggest that galanin and GalRs are worthy of further exploration as potential therapeutic targets to treat stress-related disorders and drug addiction.

AB  - Abstract
It is well established that social recognition memory is mediated, in part, by arginine vasopressin (AVP). AVP cells within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and medial amygdala (MeA) send AVP-ergic projections to the lateral septum (LS). We have demonstrated that progesterone treatment decreases AVP immunoreactivity within the BST, the MeA and the LS, and that progesterone treatment impairs social recognition. These data suggested that progesterone may impair social recognition memory by decreasing AVP. In the present experiment, we hypothesized that infusions of AVP into the LS would rescue the progesterone-induced impairment in social recognition within adult male rats. One week after adult male rats underwent cannula surgery, they were given systemic injections of either a physiological dose of progesterone or oil control for 3 days. Four hours after the last injection, we tested social recognition memory using the social discrimination paradigm, a two-trial test that is based on the natural propensity for rats to be highly motivated to investigate novel conspecifics. Immediately after the first exposure to a juvenile, each animal received bilateral infusions of either AVP or artificial cerebrospinal fluid into the LS. Our results show that, as expected, control animals exhibited normal social discrimination. In corroboration with our previous results, animals given progesterone have impaired social discrimination. Interestingly, animals treated with progesterone and AVP exhibited normal social discrimination, suggesting that AVP treatment rescued the impairment in social recognition caused by progesterone. These data also further support a role for progesterone in modulating vasopressin-dependent behavior within the male brain.

Previous research indicates that distinct subregions of the cerebellum are involved in the processing of different primary emotions. How this is achieved in terms of connectional specificity with other brain areas still needs to be elucidated.

We employed functional magnetic resonance imaging in order to investigate cerebellar activation and connectivity relevant for the processing of two basic emotions. Thirty-four healthy women were presented with pictures that specifically elicited happiness and disgust with the instruction to rate the intensity of the experienced feelings. The contrasting of both affective conditions showed that disgust evoked activation of the vermis and the cerebellar hemispheres, whereas happiness-associated activation was restricted to the posterior cerebellum. Both emotions provoked increased connectivity of the cerebellum with limbic regions. The observed extended connectivity patterns can explain why cerebellar lesions are able to produce pronounced changes of affective experience in the afflicted patients.

AB  - Abstract
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used for the treatment of a spectrum of anxiety disorders, yet paradoxically they may increase symptoms of anxiety when treatment is first initiated. Despite extensive research over the past 30 years focused on SSRI treatment, the precise mechanisms by which SSRIs exert these opposing acute and chronic effects on anxiety remain unknown. By testing the behavioral effects of SSRI treatment on Pavlovian fear conditioning, a well characterized model of emotional learning, we have the opportunity to identify how SSRIs affect the functioning of specific brain regions, including the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and hippocampus. In this review, we first define different stages of learning involved in cued and context fear conditioning and describe the neural circuits underlying these processes. We examine the results of numerous rodent studies investigating how acute SSRI treatment modulates fear learning and relate these effects to the known functions of serotonin in specific brain regions. With these findings, we propose a model by which acute SSRI administration, by altering neural activity in the extended amygdala and hippocampus, enhances both acquisition and expression of cued fear conditioning, but impairs the expression of contextual fear conditioning. Finally, we review the literature examining the effects of chronic SSRI treatment on fear conditioning in rodents and describe how downregulation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the amygdala and hippocampus may mediate the impairments in fear learning and memory that are reported. While long-term SSRI treatment effectively reduces symptoms of anxiety, their disruptive effects on fear learning should be kept in mind when combining chronic SSRI treatment and learning-based therapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy.

AB  - Abstract
In many day-to-day situations humans manifest a marked tendency to hold the head vertical while performing sensori-motor actions. For instance, when performing coordinated whole-body motor tasks, such as skiing, gymnastics or simply walking, and even when driving a car, human subjects will strive to keep the head aligned with the gravito-inertial vector. Until now, this phenomenon has been thought of as a means to limit variations of sensory signals emanating from the eyes and inner ears.

Recent theories suggest that for the task of aligning the hand to a target, the CNS compares target and hand concurrently in both visual and kinesthetic domains, rather than combining sensory data into a single, multimodal reference frame. This implies that when sensory information is lacking in one modality, it must be ‘reconstructed’ based on information from the other. Here we asked subjects to reach to a visual target with the unseen hand. In this situation, the CNS might reconstruct the orientation of the target in kinesthetic space or reconstruct the orientation of the hand in visual space, or both. By having subjects tilt the head during target acquisition or during movement execution, we show a greater propensity to perform the sensory reconstruction that can be achieved when the head is held upright.

These results suggest that the reason humans tend to keep their head upright may also have to do with how the brain manipulates and stores spatial information between reference frames and between sensory modalities, rather than only being tied to the specific problem of stabilizing visual and vestibular inputs.

AB  - Abstract
Hyperbaric oxygen-induced seizures are classified as brief, generalized tonic–clonic seizures. They are believed to cause no residual cognitive damage, although this has not been investigated in depth. In the present study, we examined whether hyperbaric oxygen-induced seizures cause impairment of behavioral and cognitive abilities. Cognitive status was assessed using four behavioral tests: Y-maze, novel object recognition, the elevated plus maze, and a passive avoidance task. Three time intervals were examined: 24 h, and 7 and 30 days after the seizures. We found transient impairment of performance in the compressed group on three tests (the novel object recognition paradigm, the Y-maze paradigm, and the passive avoidance task). On the elevated plus maze test, the impairment persisted. The time interval to the appearance of deficits and to eventual recovery was not the same for the different tests. We conclude that hyperbaric oxygen-induced seizures result in transient impairment of performance on behavioral tests in a mouse model. Further investigation is required to establish the mechanism and location of injury, and to determine whether the performance decrement on the elevated plus maze test represents permanent damage or transient damage with slow resolution. These new findings should be taken into account when planning hyperbaric oxygen treatments, to ensure that the chosen protocol is therapeutic yet minimizes the risk of CNS oxygen toxicity.

AB  - Phytoestrogens have received considerable attention because they provide an array of beneficial effects, such as neuroprotection. To better understand the molecular and functional link between phytoestrogens and classical as well as membrane estrogen receptors (ERs), we investigated the effect of daidzein on the glutamate-mediated apoptotic pathway. Our study demonstrated that daidzein (0.1–10 μM) inhibited the pro-apoptotic and neurotoxic effects caused by glutamate treatment. Hippocampal, neocortical and cerebellar tissues responded to the inhibitory action of daidzein on glutamate-activated caspase-3 and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in a similar manner. Biochemical data were supported at the cellular level by Hoechst 33342 and calcein AM staining. The sensitivity of neuronal cells to daidzein-mediated protection was most prominent in hippocampal cultures at an early stage of development 7th day in vitro. A selective estrogen receptor β (ERβ) antagonist, 4-[2-phenyl-5,7-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5,-a]pyrimidin-3-yl]phenol (PHTPP), and a selective G-protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30) antagonist, 3aS∗,4R∗,9bR∗)-4-(6-Bromo-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-3a,4,5,9b-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinoline (G15), reversed the daidzein-mediated inhibition of glutamate-induced loss of membrane mitochondrial potential, caspase-3 activity, and LDH release. A selective ERα antagonist, methyl-piperidino-pyrazole (MPP), did not influence any anti-apoptotic effect of daidzein. However, a high-affinity estrogen receptor antagonist, 7α,17β-[9-[(4,4,5,5,5-pentafluoropentyl)sulfinyl]nonyl]estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17-diol (ICI) 182,780, and a selective GPR30 agonist, (±)-1-[(3aR∗,4S∗,9bS∗)-4-(6-bromo-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-3a,4,5,9b-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinolin-8-yl]-ethanone (G1), intensified the protective action of daidzein against glutamate-induced loss of membrane mitochondrial potential and LDH release. In siRNA ERβ- and siRNA GPR30-transfected cells, daidzein did not inhibit the glutamate-induced effects. Twenty-four hour exposure to glutamate did not affect the cellular distribution of ERβ and GPR30, but caused greater than 100% increase in the levels of the receptors. Co-treatment with daidzein decreased the level of ERβ without significant changing of the GPR30 protein level.

Here, we elucidated neuroprotective effects of daidzein at low micromolar concentrations and demonstrated that the phytoestrogens may exert their effects through novel extranuclear GPR30 and the classical transcriptionally acting ERβ. These studies uncover key roles of the ERβ and GPR30 intracellular signaling pathways in mediating the anti-apoptotic action of daidzein and may provide insight into new strategies to treat or prevent neural degeneration.

AB  - Our work suggests that heteromer formation, mainly involves linear motifs (LMs) found in disordered regions of proteins. Local disorder imparts plasticity to LMs. Most molecular recognition of proteins occurs between short linear segments, known as LMs. Interaction of short continuous epitopes is not constrained by sequence and has the advantage of resulting in interactions with micromolar affinities which suit transient, reversible complexes such as receptor heteromers. Electrostatic interactions between epitopes of the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) involved, are the key step in driving heteromer formation forward. The first step in heteromerization, involves phosphorylating Ser/Thr in an epitope containing a casein kinase 1/2-consensus site. Our data suggest that dopaminergic neurotransmission, through cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) slows down heteromerization. The negative charge, acquired by the phosphorylation of a Ser/Thr in a PKA consensus site in the Arg-rich epitope, affects the activity of the receptors involved in heteromerization by causing allosteric conformational changes, due to the repulsive effect generated by the negatively charged phosphate. In addition to modulating heteromerization, it affects the stability of the heteromers’ interactions and their binding affinity. So here we have an instance where phosphorylation is not just an on/off switch, instead by weakening the noncovalent bond, heteromerization acts like a rheostat that controls the stability of the heteromer through activation or inhibition of adenylate cyclase by the neurotransmitter Dopamine depending on which Dopamine receptor it docks at.

AB  - Galanin released into the hypophysial portal circulation in the hypothalamus may function as a hypophysiotropic factor regulating the anterior pituitary function or it may function as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator acting at synaptic sites regulating neuronal activity of many neurons in the brain. Catecholamines (adrenaline, noradrenaline, and dopamine) primarily regulate anterior pituitary functions indirectly via innervating hypophysiotropic neurons. The aim of the present studies was to explore with double-label immunocytochemistry if, as in rodents, catecholamines interact with galanin in the human diencephalon. Due to the long post-mortem period and subsequent lack of optimal preservation of the cell membranes in the brain, electron microscopy could not be employed to show the presence of catecholaminergic-immunoreactive synapses on galanin-immunoreactive neurons. Therefore, we used light microscopic immunocytochemistry and high-magnification microscopy with oil immersion to identify putative juxtapositions between catecholamines and galanin-utilizing antisera against key enzymes of catecholamine synthesis (tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), representing all three catecholamines; dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH), representing noradrenaline; and phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT), representing adrenaline) and galanin. Our studies show that among the three catecholamines, dopamine is the most abundant and the vast majority of catecholaminergic contacts on galanin-immunoreactive neurons is dopaminergic. The number of DBH-immunoreactive contacts is less and the number of PNMT-immunopositive contacts is negligible. Among the hypothalamic regions, the periventricular region above the infundibulum (infundibular or arcuate nucleus) contained the largest number of contacts. These en passant-type intimate associations between catecholamine- and galanin-immunoreactive neuronal elements may be functional synapses and may provide the morphological basis for the catecholamine-mediated galanin release.

AB  - The guanidine-like compound creatine exerts bioenergetic, antiexcitotoxic, antioxidant and neuroprotective properties; however, the intracellular mechanisms responsible for these effects are still not well established. The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effect of creatine against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced cell death in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and the possible intracellular signaling pathways involved in such effect. Exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to 100–300 μM of 6-OHDA for 24 h caused a significant concentration-dependent cell death measured as a diminution of 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction and as an increase in the extracellular release of lactate dehydrogenase. SH-SY5Y cells incubated for 24 or 48 h with creatine (10–5000 μM) was not cytotoxic. However, pre and co-treatment with creatine (0.3–1000 μM) for 24 h reduced 6-OHDA-induced toxicity. The protective effect afforded by creatine against 6-OHDA-induced toxicity was reversed by inhibitors of different protein kinases, i.e. phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) (LY294002), Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) (KN-93), protein kinase A (H-89), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) (PD98059) and protein kinase C (PKC) (chelerythrine). Furthermore, creatine prevented the 6-OHDA-induced dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) at the serine 9 residue. In conclusion, the results of this study show that creatine can protect against 6-OHDA-induced toxicity and its protective mechanism is related to a signaling pathway that involves PI3K, PKC, PKA, CaMKII, MEK1/2 and GSK-3β.

AB  - Satellite glia cells (SGCs), within the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), surround the somata of most sensory neurons. SGCs have been shown to interact with sensory neurons and appear to be involved in the processing of afferent information. We found that in rat DRG various N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) subunits were expressed in SGCs in intact ganglia and in vitro. In culture, when SGCs were exposed to brief pulses of NMDA they evoked transient increases in cytoplasmic calcium that were inhibited by specific NMDA blockers (MK-801, AP5) while they were Mg2+ insensitive indicating that SGCs express functional NMDAr. The percentage of NMDA responsive SGCs was similar in mixed- (SGCs plus neurons) and SGC-enriched cultures. The pattern of the magnitude changes of the NMDA-evoked response was similar in SGCs and DRG neurons when they were in close proximity, suggesting that the NMDA response of SGCs and DRG neurons is modulated by their interactions. Treating the cultures with nerve growth factor, and/or prostaglandin E2 did not alter the percentage of SGCs that responded to NMDA. Since glutamate appears to be released within the DRG, the detection of functional NMDAr in SGCs suggests that their NMDAr activity could contribute to the interactions between neurons and SGCs. In summary we demonstrated for the first time that SGCs express functional NMDAr.

AB  - Perceptions, thoughts, emotions and actions emerge from interactions between neuronal assemblies distributed across the brain rather than from local computations in restricted brain areas. Indeed, the operation of every cognitive act requires the integration of distributed activity, as implemented through long-range neuronal communication via a network of structural connections. Functional interactions in the brain are very often studied in subjects at rest, since the resting state is a privileged condition in which brain activity is unbiased by any specific goal-directed task. Early resting state studies showed that electrophysiological oscillatory activity in specific frequency bands supports synchronization processes related to long-range neuronal communication. In turn, experimental evidence from neuroimaging studies revealed that the human brain is organized into multiple large-scale networks of regions showing correlated hemodynamic activity. Multimodal studies have begun to disclose relationships between functional connectivity, as revealed by hemodynamic signals, and underlying electrophysiological processes. Furthermore, functional connectivity studies directly based on electrophysiological signals have recently revealed fundamental information regarding long-range neuronal communication at behaviorally relevant time-scales. The integration of different lines of evidence from hemodynamic and electrophysiological studies suggests that rapid changes of synchronized oscillatory activity in distributed brain networks is relevant for the ongoing maintenance and modulation of the task representations that form the basis of our cognitive flexibility.

AB  - Spinal α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methy-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) receptor plays an important role in acute pain induced by surgical tissue injuries. Our previous study has shown that the enhanced phosphorylation of AMPA receptor GluR1 subunits at Serine-831 sites by protein kinase C (PKC) in the spinal cord dorsal horn is involved in post-surgical pain hypersensitivity. However, which isoforms of PKC are responsible for the phosphorylation of AMPA receptor GluR1 subunits at Serine-831 sites remains to be established. In the present study, using an animal model of postoperative pain, we found that surgical tissue injuries enhanced the membrane translocation level of PKCγ, but not PKCα, βI, and βII, and induced the trafficking of GluR1, but not GluR2 into neuronal plasma membrane. Intrathecal (i.t.) pretreatment of small interfering RNA targeting PKCγ to reduce the PKCγ expression in the spinal cord significantly attenuated the pain hypersensitivity and inhibited the phosphorylation of AMPA receptor GluR1 subunits at Serine-831 sites as well as GluR1 membrane trafficking. Our study indicates that the surgical incision-induced phosphorylation of AMPA receptor GluR1 subunits at Serine-831 sites and GluR1 trafficking are regulated by a PKCγ-dependent mechanism.

AB  - Abstract
In the brain, the connection between sensory information triggered by the presence of a stressor and the organism’s reaction involves limbic areas such as the hippocampus, amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Consequently, these brain regions are the most sensitive to stress-induced changes in neuronal plasticity. However, the specific effects of stress on neuronal plasticity in these regions largely differ. Despite these regional differences, in many cases the steps leading to brain adaptation to stress involve highly coordinated changes in gene expression affecting cell metabolism, neuronal plasticity and synaptic transmission.

In adult life the effects of stress on neuronal plasticity are largely reversible but stress in early life induces persistent changes in neuronal plasticity that increases vulnerability to develop psychopathologies and aging-related cognitive decline, suggesting the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that microRNAs (miRs) are key players in epigenetic regulation.

In this forefront review we present a critical look on the literature demonstrating the regulation of neuronal plasticity by miRs and the molecular mechanisms of target specificity in neurons. We propose that further progress in the identification of miR’s function beyond single target identification would require a combination of developmental expression studies, bioinformatics and a deeper understanding of large networks of targets involved in epigenetic regulation. This will help to extend our understanding of the role miRs play in the regulation of stress-induced neuronal plasticity.

AB  - Abstract
Functional imaging studies have revealed differential brain activation patterns in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) adult patients performing working memory (WM) tasks. The existence of alterations in WM-related cortical circuits during childhood may precede executive dysfunctions in this disorder in adults. To date, there is no study exploring the electrophysiological activation of WM-related neural networks in ADHD. To address this issue, we carried out an electroencephalographic (EEG) activation study associated with time–frequency (TF) analysis in 15 adults with ADHD and 15 controls performing two visual N-back WM tasks, as well as oddball detection and passive fixation tasks. Frontal transient (phasic) theta event-related synchronization (ERS, 0–500 msec) was significantly reduced in ADHD as compared to control subjects. Such reduction was equally present in a task-independent manner. In contrast, the power of the later sustained (∼500–1200 msec) theta ERS for all tasks was comparable in ADHD and control groups. In active WM tasks, ADHD patients displayed lower alpha event-related desynchronization (ERD, ∼200–900 msec) and higher subsequent alpha ERS (∼900–2400 msec) compared to controls. The time course of alpha ERD/ERS cycle was modified in ADHD patients compared to controls, suggesting that they are able to use late compensatory mechanisms in order to perform this WM task. These findings support the idea of an ADHD-related dysfunction of neural generators sub-serving attention directed to the incoming visual information. ADHD cases may successfully face WM needs depending on the preservation of sustained theta ERS and prolonged increase of alpha ERS at later post-stimulus time points.

The complexity of the internal structure of the striatum is not completely understood, and the striosomes/matrix compartmentalization in particular has been one of the intriguing substructures of the striatum. Although various neurochemical markers have been used to visualize striosomes with sufficient clarity, it still remains obscure whether striosomes that are detectable by a single marker represent all of the striosomal compartments and to what extent the compartments are uniform across different intrastriatal positions. Triple immunohistochemical labeling for the three representative striosomes/matrix markers, μ-opioid receptor (MOR), substance P (SP), and enkephalin (Enk), was applied to serial sections covering the whole striatum of the mouse (n = 8). The majority of MOR-positive striosomes were confined to the rostral quarter of the striatum. In contrast, SP-positive striosomes were distributed more broadly in the rostral two-thirds of the striatum. No striosomes were observable in the caudal third by the present method. In the rostral striatum, the majority of striosomes were labeled for both MOR and SP, but some at the most rostral positions were detectable only by MOR, while caudally located striosomes were identifiable only by SP. Thus MOR- and SP-immunoreactivities in striosomes exhibited contrasting patterns along the rostrocaudal axis. The Enk immunohistochemistry produced complicated profiles and was unsuitable for the detection of striosomes in mice. However, Enk immunoreactivity in MOR and/or SP-positive striosomes was higher in the ventral portion than in the dorsal portion in the rostral striatum. The present study revealed the region-specific diversity of striosomes, suggesting site-dependent differential regulation of striosomal neurons by MOR ligands and SP that are contained in indirect- and direct-pathway neurons, respectively. The results further suggest the necessity of viewing the striosomes as non-uniform compartments in addition to the traditional dichotomous view, which focuses on discrimination between the striosomes and the matrix.

We have recently demonstrated that the ventral premammillary nucleus (PMV) plays a key role in the metabolic control of the female reproductive axis. However, whether PMV neurons modulate the reproductive neural circuitry and/or the expression of sexual behaviors has not been determined. Here, we showed that the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors in the PMV is modulated by changing levels of sex steroids across the estrous cycle. We also showed that sexual behavior, not the high physiologic levels of sex steroids, induces Fos in PMV neurons. Bilateral lesions of the PMV caused no significant changes in proceptive behavior but a high percentage of PMV-lesioned rats failed to exhibit lordosis behavior when exposed to a sexually experienced male rat (50% vs. 18% in the control group). Notably, lesions of the PMV disrupted the physiologic fluctuations of Kiss1 and GnRH mRNA expression characteristic of the proestrus-to-estrus transition. This neurochemical imbalance may ultimately alter female reproductive behavior. Our findings suggest that the PMV is a component of the neural circuitry that modulates the physiologic fluctuations of key neuroendocrine players (i.e., Kiss1 and GnRH) in the control of the female reproductive physiology.

AB  - Abstract
Little is known about the influence of arsenic (As) exposure on monoamine neurotransmitters and the underlying mechanisms, although arsenic toxicity on the central nervous system has been well documented. In the present study, the levels of norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA), and 5-HT were determined by high performance liquid chromatography in the cerebrum and cerebellum of mice exposed to 1, 2 and 4 ppm As2O3 through drinking water for 60 days. The ultra-structural change of vesicles in the synapses of mice brains was observed by transmission electron microscopy; the mRNA expressions of dopamine beta hydroxylase (DBH), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) as NE, DA and 5-HT synthetases were quantitatively assessed by real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. It was shown that the concentrations of NE, DA and 5-HT in the cerebrum or cerebellum of mice exposed to As were significantly lower than those in the control group. The number of synaptic vesicles significantly decreased in the brain of mice exposed to As. Moreover, the expressions of TH, TPH and DBH genes were significantly lower in the brains of mice exposed to As than those in the controls. These results suggested that subchronic exposure to As might decrease the concentrations of the three monoamine neurotransmitters in the mouse brain and downregulate TH, TPH and DBH gene expressions. It was also indicated that the decreased concentrations of the three monoamine neurotransmitters in the brain might be related to the down-regulated gene expressions of these synthetases by As.

AB  - Abstract
Damage from oxidative stress plays a critical role in spinal cord injury. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf-2) signaling pathway can be activated by cellular oxidative stress. Resveratrol, a plant-derived polyphenolic compound found in red wine, has antioxidant properties. In the present study, we have examined the neuroprotective effect of resveratrol and the role of Nrf-2 in spinal cord hypoxic injury. The spinal cord was removed from adult male Wistar rats from T2–T10 and the dorsal column was used to induce hypoxic injury in vitro with and without treatment with resveratrol (50 μM). Significant changes were found in the compound action potential (CAP) of spinal cord dorsal column, and hematoxyline and eosin (H&amp;E) staining showed that resveratrol significantly improved neuronal injury. The biochemical assays showed significant changes in lipid peroxidase (LPO), reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), protein carbonyl (PC), mitochondrial ATP content, and mitochondrial Ca++. Furthermore, using immunohistochemistry and Western blot, we found that after resveratrol treatment during hypoxic injury there was a significant activation of NrF-2 and down regulation of the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) content. The results show that resveratrol treatment has neuroprotective effects on CAP, Ca++ loading, and biochemical parameters after hypoxic injury. The neuroprotective effect is likely to be exerted by increased activation of transcription factor Nrf-2 by resveratrol along with its direct antioxidant effect to ameliorate the oxidative damage and preserve mitochondrial function.

AB  - Abstract
Increased glutamatergic neurotransmission appears to mediate the reinforcing properties of drugs of abuse, including ethanol (EtOH). We recently reported that the administration of ceftriaxone (CEF), a β-lactam antibiotic known to upregulate glutamate transporter 1 (GLT1) levels/activity, decreased the maintenance of EtOH intake in adult male alcohol-preferring (P) rats. In the present study, we tested whether CEF administration would reduce the acquisition and maintenance of EtOH drinking in adolescent and adult female P rats. The rats were treated with saline or 200 mg/kg ceftriaxone for 7 days (starting at 35 or 75 days old, respectively) followed by the EtOH acquisition test. Five weeks later the effects of CEF were examined regarding the maintenance of EtOH intake. For the maintenance test, half of the animals that received CEF during acquisition received CEF for 7 days and the other half received saline for 7 days. Saline-treated acquisition animals were treated similarly. The results indicated that pretreatment with ceftriaxone reduced the maintenance of EtOH intake in both animals that started as adolescents and those that started as adults. However, the beneficial effect of CEF was more pronounced in rats pretreated with CEF as adults compared with rats pretreated as adolescents. Reductions in EtOH intake by ceftriaxone were paralleled by an upregulation of GLT1 protein levels in both the nucleus accumbens (∼25% in rats starting at both ages) and prefrontal cortex (∼50% in rats starting as peri-adolescents and ∼65% in those starting as adults). These findings provide further support for GLT1-associated mechanisms in high alcohol-consuming behavior, and hold promise for the development of effective treatments targeting alcohol abuse and dependence.

AB  - Abstract
Motor neuron disorders may be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, and repetitive electrical impulse conduction during energy restriction has been found to cause neuronal degeneration. The aim of this study was to investigate the vulnerability of motor axons of a presymptomatic late-onset, fast-progression SOD1G127X mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis to long-lasting, high-frequency repetitive activity. Tibial nerves were stimulated at ankle in 7 to 8-month-old SOD1G127X mice when they were clinically indistinguishable from wild-type (WT) mice. The evoked compound muscle action potentials and ascending compound nerve action potentials were recorded from plantar muscles and from the sciatic nerve, respectively. Repetitive stimulation (RS) was carried out in interrupted trains of 200-Hz for 3 h. During the stimulation-sequence there was progressive conduction failure in WT and, to a lesser extent, in the SOD1G127X. By contrast, 3 days after RS the electrophysiological responses remained reduced in the SOD1G127X but recovered completely in WT. Additionally, morphological studies showed Wallerian degeneration in the disease model. Nerve excitability testing by “threshold-tracking” showed that axons recovering from RS had changes in excitability suggestive of membrane hyperpolarization, which was smaller in the SOD1G127X than in WT. Our data provide proof-of-principle that SOD1G127X axons are less resistant to activity-induced changes in ion-concentrations. It is possible that in SOD1G127X there is inadequate energy-dependent Na+/K+ pumping, which may lead to a lethal Na+ overload.

AB  - Promoting neural stem/progenitor cell (NSC/NPC) survival in the pro-apoptotic environment is critical to stem cell replacement for neurodegenerative disease therapy. Paeoniflorin (PF), one of the principal bioactive components in Paeoniae Radix, has been used widely in central nervous system (CNS) diseases treatment and serves as an antioxidant to protect neurons against oxidative stress. The present study investigated the protective effects of PF on NPC injury induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). After challenge with 200 μM H2O2 for 2 h, loss of cell viability and excessive apoptotic cell death were observed in cultured NPC, PF treatment conferred protective effects against the loss of cellular viability in a concentration-dependent manner. PF pretreatment also inhibited NPC apoptosis induced by H2O2 by reversing the decreased level of Procaspase-3 and balancing Bcl-2 and Bax expression. Furthermore, PF-mediated NPC protection was associated with an increase in phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt-1) phosphorylation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Selective inhibition of PI3K using LY294002 abolished PF-mediated phosphorylation of Akt-1 and NPC protection upon oxidative stress. These data suggest that PF-mediated NPC protection on H2O2 injury is reliant on the activation of the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway, giving insight to an essential role of PF in NPC protection.

AB  - The biochemical properties and subcellular localization of prolyl endopeptidase (PREP) in brain are well characterized and its implications in the realization of cognitive processes and in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders are a matter of intensive investigation. In contrast, very little is known about its homolog, the PREP-like protein (PREPL). In order to obtain initial hints about the involvement of PREPL in physiological processes, a differential proteomic screen was performed with human skin fibroblasts from controls and patients with PREPL deficiency (hypotonia–cystinuria syndrome). The majority of affected proteins represented cytoskeletal proteins, including caldesmon, tropomyosin α3 chain, lamin A, β-actin, γ-actin, vimentin and zyxin. Therefore, the analysis of PREPL subcellular localization by confocal laser scanning and electron microscopy in mouse neurons was focused on the cytoskeleton. The co-localization of PREPL with cytoskeletal marker proteins such as β-actin and microtubulin-associated protein-2 was observed, in addition to the presence of PREPL within Golgi apparatus and growth cones. In the mouse brain, PREPL is neuronally expressed and highly abundant in neocortex, substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. This mirrors to some extent the distribution pattern of PREP and points toward redundant functions of both proteins. In the human neocortex, PREPL immunostaining was found in the cytoplasm and in neuropil, in particular of layer V pyramidal neurons. This staining was reduced in the neocortex of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. Moreover, in AD brains, PREPL immunoreactivity was observed in the nucleus and in varicose neuritic processes. Our data indicate physiological functions of PREPL associated with the cytoskeleton, which may be affected under conditions of cytoskeletal degeneration.

AB  - Abstract
The neural underpinnings of working and recognition memory have traditionally been studied in the visual domain and these studies pinpoint the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) as a primary region for visual memory processing (Miller et al., 1996; Ranganath et al., 2004; Kennerley and Wallis, 2009). Herein, we utilize single-unit recordings for the same region in monkeys (Macaca mulatta) but investigate a second modality examining auditory working and recognition memory during delayed matching-to-sample (DMS) performance. A large portion of neurons in the dorsal and ventral banks of the principal sulcus (area 46, 46/9) show DMS event-related activity to one or more of the following task events: auditory cues, memory delay, decision wait time, response, and/or reward portions. Approximately 50% of the neurons show evidence of auditory-evoked activity during the task and population activity demonstrated encoding of recognition memory in the form of match enhancement. However, neither robust nor sustained delay activity was observed. The neuronal responses during the auditory DMS task are similar in many respects to those found within the visual working memory domain, which supports the hypothesis that the lPFC, particularly area 46, functionally represents key pieces of information for recognition memory inclusive of decision-making, but regardless of modality.

AB  - Abstract
Activation of the GABAA receptor results in inhibition of neuronal activity. One subunit of this multi-subunit receptor termed alpha 6 (Gabrα6) contributed to inflammatory temporomandibular joint (TMJ) nociception but TMJ disorders often include myofascial pain. To address Gabrα6 role in myofascial pain we hypothesized that Gabrα6 has an inhibitory role in myofascial nociceptive responses similar to inflammatory TMJ arthritis. To test this hypothesis a, myofascial nociceptive response was induced by placing a ligature bilaterally on the tendon attachment of the anterior superficial part of a male rat’s masseter muscle. Four days after ligature placement Gabrα6 expression was reduced by infusing the trigeminal ganglia (TG) with small interfering RNA (siRNA) having homology to either the Gabrα6 gene (Gabrα6 siRNA) or no known gene (control siRNA). After siRNA infusion nociceptive behavioral responses were measured, i.e., feeding behavior and head withdrawal after pressing upon the region above the ligature with von Frey filaments. Neuronal activity in the TG and trigeminal nucleus caudalis and upper cervical region (Vc–C1) was measured by quantitating the amount of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK). Total Gabrα6 and GABAA receptor contents in the TG and Vc–C1 were determined. Gabrα6 siRNA infusion reduced Gabrα6 and GABAA receptor expression and significantly increased the nociceptive response in both nociceptive assays. Gabrα6 siRNA infusion also significantly increased TG p-ERK expression of the ligated rats. From these results we conclude GABAA receptors consisting of the Gabrα6 subunit inhibit TG nociceptive sensory afferents in the trigeminal pathway and have an important role in the regulation of myofascial nociception.

AB  - Abstract
The olfactory system responds to the same stimulus with great variability according to the current state of the brain. At the levels of multi-unit activity and local field potentials, the response of the olfactory bulb (OB) to a given olfactory stimulus during a state of lower background activity is stronger than the response that occurs during higher background activity, but the distribution pattern of activity remains similar. However, these results have only been established at the individual neuron and neuron cluster scales in previous studies. It remains unclear whether these results are consistent at a larger scale (e.g., OB regions); therefore, intrinsic optical signals imaging was employed in the present study to clarify this issue. The basal brain states of rats were manipulated by using different levels of anesthesia. Under a state of low basal brain activity, the intensity of the activity pattern elicited in the dorsal OB by a given odorant was significantly higher than that under high basal brain activity, but the topography was highly similar across different brain states. These results were consistent across the levels of individual neurons, neuron clusters, glomeruli, and the OB regions, which suggest that the OB contains as yet unknown neural mechanisms that ensure the high-fidelity representation of the same olfactory stimulation under different brain states.

AB  - Abstract
Excessive alcohol consumption is prevalent among adolescents and may result in lasting neurobehavioral consequences. The use of animal models to study adolescent alcohol exposure has the advantage of allowing for the control necessary in order to evaluate the effects of ethanol on the brain and separate such effects from genetic background and other environmental insults. In the present study the effects of moderate ethanol vapor exposure, during adolescence, on measures of neurogenesis and behavioral measures were evaluated at two different times following ethanol withdrawal, in adulthood. The two groups of Wistar rats were both exposed to intermittent ethanol vapor (14 h on/10 h off/day) for 35–36 days from PD 23 to PD 58 (average blood ethanol concentration: 163 mg%). In the first group, after rats were withdrawn from vapor they were subsequently assessed for locomotor activity, conflict behavior in the open field, and behaviors in the forced swim test (FST) and then sacrificed at 72 days of age. The second group of rats were withdrawn from vapor and injected for 5 days with Bromo-deoxy-Uridine (BrdU). Over the next 8 weeks they were also assessed for locomotor activity, conflict behavior in the open field, and behaviors in the FST and then sacrificed at 113/114 days of age. All rats were perfused for histochemical analyses. Ethanol vapor-exposed rats displayed hypoactivity in tests of locomotion and less anxiety-like and/or more “disinhibitory” behavior in the open field conflict. Quantitative analyses of immunoreactivity revealed a significant reduction in measures of neurogenesis, progenitor proliferation, as indexed by doublecortin (DCX), Ki67, and increased markers of cell death as indexed by cleaved caspase-3, and Fluoro-Jade at 72 days, and decreases in DCX, and increases in cleaved caspase-3 at 114 days in the ethanol vapor-exposed rats. Progenitor survival, as assessed by BrdU+, was reduced in the vapor-exposed animals that were sacrificed at 114 days. The reduction seen in DCX labeled in cell counts was significantly correlated with hypoactivity at 24 h after withdrawal as well as less anxiety-like and/or more “disinhibitory” behavior in the open field conflict test at 2 and 8 weeks following termination of vapor exposure. These studies demonstrate that behavioral measures of disinhibitory behavior correlated with decreases in neurogenesis are all significantly and persistently impacted by periadolescent ethanol exposure and withdrawal in Wistar rats.

AB  - Vestibular afferent neurons (VANs) transmit information from the vestibular end organs to the central nuclei. This information is encoded within the firing pattern of these cells and is heavily influenced by the K+ conductances expressed by vestibular neurons. In the present study, we describe the presence of a previously unidentified Na+-activated K+ conductance (KNa) in these cells. We observed that the blocking of Na+ channels by tetrodotoxin (TTX) or the substitution of choline for Na+ in the extracellular solution during voltage clamp pulses resulted in the reduction of a sustained outward current that was dependent on the Na+ current. Furthermore, increases in the intracellular concentration of Na+ that were made by blocking the Na+/K+ ATPase with ouabain increased the amplitude of the outward current, and reduction of the intracellular Cl− concentration reduced the TTX-sensitive outward current. The substitution of Li+ for Na+ in the extracellular solution significantly reduced the amplitude of the outward current in voltage clamp pulses and decreased the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) of the action potentials in current clamp experiments. These electrophysiological results are consistent with the presence of mRNA transcripts for the KNa subunits Slick and Slack in the vestibular ganglia and in the sensory epithelium, which were detected using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These results are also consistent with the immunolabeling of Slick and Slack protein in isolated vestibular neurons, in the vestibular ganglion and in the vestibular sensory epithelium. These results indicate that KNa channels are expressed in VANs and in their terminals. Furthermore, these data indicate that these channels may contribute to the firing pattern of vestibular neurons.

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is known to be up-regulated in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) after peripheral nerve injury, and to contribute to neuropathic pain. Here, we found that thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia at day 7 post-injury were inhibited only when anti-BDNF antibody was intrathecally administrated at day 2 post-injury. Consistent with behavioral results, Western blot analysis showed that the expression levels of BDNF protein in the spinal dorsal horn were markedly induced during early stage post-injury. Moreover, the maximal increase in BDNF mRNA expression in the DRG was observed at day 1 post-injury, and significantly elevated levels were sustained for at least 14 days. Four of five BDNF mRNA transcripts were up-regulated after nerve injury, and the most inducible transcript was exon I. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, we found that nerve injury promotes histone H3 and H4 acetylation, transcriptionally active modifications, at BDNF promoter I at day 1 post-injury, and the levels of histone acetylation remain elevated for at least 7 days. Taken together, our findings suggest that an initial increase in BDNF exon I expression controlled by epigenetic mechanisms might have a crucial role in the development of neuropathic pain.

AB  - Auditory event-related potentials (ERP)s of the P1–N1–P2 complex are modulated when participants hear frequency-altered feedback (FAF) regarding their ongoing vocal productions. However, the relationship between feedback perturbation magnitudes and the resultant neural responses is at present unclear. In the present study, we exposed speakers to FAF of different magnitudes ranging from 0 to 400 cents. Vocal responses and P1–N1–P2–N2 ERPs were examined in an attempt to relate variation in the magnitude of the imposed feedback perturbation with variation in vocal and neural responses. Overall, vocal response magnitudes remained relatively consistent in response to smaller feedback perturbations (&lt;250 cents), while larger feedback perturbations (&gt;300 cents) resulted in decreased vocal response magnitudes. P1 amplitudes were found to increase in a non-specific manner in response to FAF. Conversely, N1 amplitudes displayed increased specificity: small feedback perturbations evoked one size of response, while larger feedback perturbations resulted in larger responses. The P2 component showed the most systematic amplitude modulation as feedback perturbation magnitude increased. A regression analysis highlighted the relationship between vocal response magnitude and P2 amplitude, with both vocal response magnitude and P2 amplitude increasing in response to perturbations between 50 and 250 cents, and then decreasing in response to larger perturbations. Although not generally observed in FAF studies, a robust N2 was also found; N2 amplitudes increased as stimulus magnitudes increased. The pattern of P1–N1–P2–N2 amplitude modulation in response to different magnitudes of FAF indicates that these components reflect processes involved in the detection and correction of unintended changes in auditory feedback during speech.

Plenty of evidence supports the effects of probiotics on the function of many systems including the nervous system. Here we report the effect of probiotics treatment on the behavioral and electrophysiological aspects of learning and memory disorders. Diabetic rats were made through intraperitoneal injection of streptozocin. The control and diabetic rats were fed with either normal regimen (control rats recieving normal regimen (CO) and diabetics rats receiving normal regimen (DC), respectively) or normal regimen plus probiotic supplementation for 2 months (control rats receiving probiotic supplementation (CP) and diabetics rats recieving probiotic supplementation (DP), respectively). The animals were first introduced to spatial learning task in the Morris water maze. Then, in electrophysiological experiments, stimulating the Schaffer collaterals the basic and potentiated excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSPs) were recorded in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. Finally, the serum levels of glucose, insulin, superoxide dismutase and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were measured. We found that probiotics administration considerably improved the impaired spatial memory in the diabetic animals. The probiotics supplementation in the diabetic rats recovered the declined basic synaptic transmission and further restored the hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). While the probiotics administration enhanced the activation of superoxide dismutase and increased the insulin level of serum it decreased both the glucose level of serum and the 8-OHdG factor. From the present results we concluded that probiotics efficiently reverse deteriorated brain functions in the levels of cognitive performances and their proposed synaptic mechanisms in diabetes mellitus. These considerations imply on the necessity of an optimal function of the microbiome–gut–brain axis in the behavioral as well as electrophysiological aspects of brain action.

AB  - We have investigated the effect of IMM-H004 (7-hydroxy-5-methoxy-4-methyl-3-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-2H-chromen-2-one), a coumarin derivative, on the amyloid beta (Aβ)-induced neurotoxicity in primary culture cortical neurons and pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Our results showed that treatment with IMM-H004 markedly reduced the number of apoptotic cells after exposure to Aβ25–35 or Aβ1–42, determined by MTT, TUNEL staining and Flow cytometry. Further study indicated that IMM-H004 significantly inhibited Aβ-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis by reversing Aβ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, including MMP (mitochondrial membrane potential) decrease, reactive oxygen species production, and mitochondrial release of cytochrome c. IMM-H004 can regulate the interaction between Bax and Bcl-2, decreased levels of p53 and active caspase-3 protein induced by Aβ25–35. Furthermore, IMM-H004 also reduced translocation of AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor) induced by Aβ25–35. These results demonstrated that IMM-H004 was capable of protecting neuronal cells from Aβ-induced degeneration through a mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway. The results of this study lend further credence to the notion that IMM-H004 is a ‘multipotent therapeutic agrent’ that reduces toxic levels of brain Aβ, and holds the potential to protect neuronal mitochondrial function in Alzheimer’s disease.

AB  - Various studies have shown that increased activity of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis can predict the onset of adolescent depressive symptomatology. We have previously shown that adolescents making the transition to high school present a significant increase in cortisol levels, the main product of HPA axis activation. In the present study, we evaluated whether a school-based education program developed according to the current state of knowledge on stress in psychoneuroendocrinology decreases cortisol levels and/or depressive symptoms in adolescents making the transition to high school. Participants were 504 Year 7 high school students from two private schools in the Montreal area. Adolescents of one school were exposed to the DeStress for Success Program while adolescents from the other school served as controls. Salivary cortisol levels and depressive symptomatology were measured before, immediately after as well as 3 months after exposure to the program. Measures of negative mood were obtained at baseline in order to determine whether adolescents starting high school with specific negative moods were differentially responsive to the program. The results show that only adolescents starting high school with high levels of anger responded to the intervention with a significant decrease in cortisol levels. Moreover, we found that adolescents who took part in the intervention and showed decreasing cortisol levels following the intervention (responders) were 2.45 times less at risk to suffer from clinical and subclinical depressive states three months post-intervention in comparison to adolescents who showed increasing cortisol levels following the intervention (nonresponders). This study provides the first evidence that a school-based program on stress is effective at decreasing cortisol levels and depressive symptomatology in adolescents making the transition to high school and it helps explain which adolescents are sensitive to the program and what are some of the characteristics of these individuals.

AB  - While intense or highly arousing stressors have long been known to suppress pain, relatively mild or chronic stress can enhance pain. The mechanisms underlying stress-induced hyperalgesia (SIH) are only now being defined. The physiological and neuroendocrine effects of mild stress are mediated by the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), which has documented connections with the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), a brainstem region capable of facilitating nociception. We hypothesized that stress engages both the DMH and the RVM to produce hyperalgesia. Direct pharmacological activation of the DMH increased sensitivity to mechanical stimulation in awake animals, confirming that the DMH can mediate behavioral hyperalgesia. A behavioral model of mild stress also produced mechanical hyperalgesia, which was blocked by inactivation of either the DMH or the RVM. The neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) acts in the RVM to enhance nociception and is abundant in the DMH. Using a retrograde tracer and immunohistochemical labeling, we determined that CCK-expressing neurons in the DMH are the only significant supraspinal source of CCK in the RVM. However, not all neurons projecting from the DMH to the RVM contained CCK, and microinjection of the CCK2 receptor antagonist YM022 in the RVM did not interfere with SIH, suggesting that transmitters in addition to CCK play a significant role in this connection during acute stress. While the RVM has a well-established role in facilitation of nociception, the DMH, with its well-documented role in stress, may also be engaged in a number of chronic or abnormal pain states. Taken as a whole, these findings establish an anatomical and functional connection between the DMH and RVM by which stress can facilitate pain.

AB  - When the prime word is masked and flashed very quickly, its presence cannot be perceived by the subjects, but it can still accelerate the processing of the subsequent relevant target stimulus. This is known as the masked priming effect. Adopting a similar experimental paradigm, in this study we take the gray scale pictures describing ordinary objects as prime stimuli and the environmental sounds as target stimuli. The subjects are then asked to classify the target sounds to investigate whether incongruent target sounds elicit the N400 semantic priming effect. At the same time, the prime-mask withdraw value is made at these time intervals: 16 ms, 33 ms, 50 ms, 66 ms and 83 ms, so as to reveal whether there exists a correlation between the prime duration and the priming effect. The result shows that, at each time interval, the processing of sounds that are congruent with prime pictures is sped up and sounds that are incongruent with prime pictures trigger the N400 effect. The amplitude of the N400 effect is enlarged proportionally with the time interval and gradually approaches the point of saturation. Given this, it is believed that the N400 effect reflects automatic semantic processing, that consciousness is not a prerequisite of semantic priming, and that early visual information has an accumulative priming effect on target sounds.

AB  - Human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have multi-lineage differentiation potential and can become cells of mesodermal and neural lineages. These stem cells thus hold considerable clinical promise for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. For successful regeneration of damaged neural tissues, directed differentiation of neural or neuronal precursor cells from MSCs and integration of transplanted cells are pivotal factors. We induced MSCs into neurogenesis using a modified protocol. The therapeutic potency of the resulting neural progenitor cells in a rat model of ischemic stroke was analyzed. Using a highly hydrophobic diphenylamino-s-triazine-bridged p-phenylene (DTOPV)-coated surface and adopting a procedure for propagation of neural stem cells, we efficiently converted MSCs into neurosphere-like cellular aggregates (NS-MSCs). The spherical cells were subsequently induced to differentiate into neural cells expressing neuroectodermal markers. To determine whether these cells had neuronal fates and induced neuro-protective effects in vivo, NS-MSCs were intra-cerebrally administered to rats 48 h after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAo). The results showed a remarkable attenuation of ischemic damage with significant functional recovery, although the cells were not fully incorporated into the damaged tissues on post-operative day 26. Improvement in the NS-MSC-transplanted rats was faster than in the MSC group and suppression of inflammation was likely the key factor. Thus, our culture system using the hydrophobic surface of a biocompatible DTOPV coating efficiently supported neural cell differentiation from MSCs. Neural-primed MSCs exhibited stronger therapeutic effects than MSCs in rat brains with pMCAo.

AB  - Recent developments in the technology to breed and house laboratory rodents for medical research has produced individually ventilated cage (IVC) systems. These IVC systems produce a cage environment significantly different to conventional cages. As it is not known in detail whether housing mice in IVCs impacts on their baseline and drug-induced behaviours compared to mice of conventional filter-top cages a comprehensive multi-tiered phenotyping strategy was used to test the behavioural consequences of IVC housing in male and female C57BL/6JArc mice. IVC had anxiety-like effects in the elevated plus maze, which were more pronounced in female mice whereas cognition and locomotion of all test mice were not modified by IVC housing. Mice raised in IVC cage systems were socially more active than mice of filter-top systems. Furthermore, males raised in IVC exhibited an increased sensitivity to the locomotor-stimulating effects of acute MK-801 treatment compared to males in conventional cages. In summary, this is the first study revealing the longer-term effects of IVC housing on social behaviours and the locomotor response to an acute MK-801 challenge. In conclusion, researchers upgrading their holding facilities to IVC housing may encounter a shift in experimental outcomes (e.g. post pharmacological challenges) and the behavioural phenotype of test mice. Furthermore, differences between the housing conditions of breeding facilities and test facilities must carefully be considered. Finally, researchers should clarify in detail the type of housing test animals have been exposed to when publishing experimental animal research data.

AB  - The stability and efficacy of neuronal circuits are achieved through a detailed balance between pyramidal cell and interneuron activities. Interestingly, the neocortical excitatory–inhibitory (E–I) balance is actively maintained at the soma of Layer 5 pyramidal neurons which receive 20% of excitation and 80% of inhibition after dendritic integration, and this is not affected by changes in synaptic strength. To infer the role of serotonergic neuromodulation on the activity-dependent maintenance of the E–I balance, we performed continuous voltage clamp measurements of stimulation-locked conductance dynamics in Layer 5 pyramidal neurons before and after long-term potentiation (LTP) induction, together with chronic or acute manipulation of serotonin function. When a theta-burst stimulation was applied in Layer 2/3 of 5-HT depleted cortical slices (after in vivo treatment with the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA)), or after in vitro perfusion of the potent 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100,635, we observed a persistent shift of the ratio between excitation and inhibition toward more inhibition. This was due to a strong LTP of inhibition co-aligned with a weak LTP of excitation, whereas the same protocol caused a similar potentiation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs when applied in control slices. In contrast, neither excitatory nor inhibitory postsynaptic currents were potentiated when LTP protocols were delivered in the presence of either the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram or the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT. This is the first demonstration that serotonergic neuromodulation is crucial for the maintenance of the neocortical E–I balance during high-frequency regimes.

AB  - The removal of bilateral olfactory bulbs (OBs) can result in serious behavioral, neurochemical, neuroendocrine, and neuroimmune alterations in depressed patients. However, there is little information on how olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) leads to depression. Habenular nuclei and their connections are important in the regulation of psychomotor and psychosocial behaviors through afferent impulses of the olfactory system. Therefore, we investigated whether OB lesions lead to habenular degeneration. We used a sample of 50 rats (25 female and 25 male) for this study. Of these rats, five male and five female rats were taken as the control group. The remaining 40 rats (20 male and 20 female rats) constituted the study group, and frontal burr holes were performed at the OB level on these rats. OB cauterization was applied to 10 male and 10 female rats (n = 10, 10; study group 1), mechanical OBX was applied to five male and five female rats (n = 5, 5; study group 2), and no procedure was performed on the remaining 10 rats (n = 5, 5). The psychomotor movements; pregnancy rates; and sexual, feeding, maternal, social, and grooming behaviors for both study groups were observed daily for 3 months. Their OBs, olfactory cortices, and habenular complexes were examined using stereological methods. All of the animals in the study groups, especially in the cauterization group, demonstrated anorexia, nutritional disorders, weight loss, psychomotor retardation, sexual aversion, decreased grooming behavior, and reduced social interaction similar to depression symptoms. As compared to the control group, the pregnancy rates, number of offspring per mother rat, and birth weights in the study groups were lower, whereas the number of stillbirths was higher. Gross anatomical examinations revealed that the OBs of all of the animals in the study groups were atrophied. Histopathological examinations detected prominent neuronal loss due to apoptosis in the habenular structures in the study groups. We detected a relationship between a decreased healthy neuronal density of the habenula and depressive symptomatology in rats with OBX. We suggest that olfaction disorders might cause neuropsychiatric disorders by affecting neuronal degeneration in habenular nuclei.

AB  - MicroRNA (miRNA) is a class of small non-coding RNA which regulates post-transcriptional gene expression by repressing and thereby fine-tuning protein production, mainly via sequence-specific binding within the 3′untranslated region of mRNA transcripts. Although in humans there are only ∼1600 miRNAs, bioinformatics, systems studies and advanced quantitative proteomics reveal miRNA regulation of over half of all protein-coding genes and that each miRNA can regulate multiple proteins. Epilepsy is a common, serious neurologic disorder characterized by recurring unprovoked seizures that result from abnormal firing of populations of neurons in the brain. The brain expresses several unique miRNAs which control dendritic morphology as well as ion channel levels, neuronal migration and glial function. There is an emerging view that the patho-mechanisms underlying the process of epileptogenesis, as well as maintenance and progression of the epileptic state, involve miRNAs that control multiple genes and proteins on a systems level. Expression profiling studies reveal select changes to brain miRNA levels following prolonged seizures (status epilepticus) in animal models. Inflammation, stress signaling and neuronal excitation are among the pathways most impacted. Analysis of miRNA expression in human epilepsy has also been performed, where again neuroinflammatory processes were prominent. These studies suggest that miRNAs may regulate certain key processes but are not necessarily broadly altering all patho-mechanisms in epilepsy. Functional studies employing antagomirs have identified contributions from miR-34a and miR-132 to seizure-induced neuronal death whereas silencing miR-134 potently reduced status epilepticus, seizure-damage and the later occurrence of spontaneous seizures. Efforts to identify the in vivo target(s) of epilepsy-regulated miRNAs, is now a priority. Last, miRNAs are stable, information-carrying (paracrine) signals. Profiling miRNA in biofluids may represent a novel source of disease biomarkers in epilepsy. In summary, miRNA is emerging as a critical new layer of gene expression control with implications for the cause and treatment of epilepsy.

AB  - Investigations of local field potentials of the subthalamic nucleus of patients with Parkinson’s disease have provided evidence for pathologically exaggerated oscillatory beta-band activity (13–30 Hz) which is amenable to physiological modulation by, e.g., voluntary movement. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in healthy controls have provided evidence for an increase of subthalamic nucleus blood-oxygenation-level-dependant signal in incremental force generation tasks.

However, the modulation of neuronal activity by force generation and its relationship to peripheral feedback remain to be elucidated. We hypothesised that beta-band activity in the subthalamic nucleus is modulated by incremental force generation. Subthalamic nucleus local field potentials were recorded intraoperatively in 13 patients with Parkinson’s disease (37 recording sites) during rest and five incremental isometric force generation conditions of the arm with applied loads of 0–400 g (in 100-g increments).

Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a modulation of local field potential (LFP) power in the upper beta-band (in 24–30 Hz; F(3.042) = 4.693, p = 0.036) and the gamma-band (in 70–76 Hz; F(4) = 4.116, p = 0.036). Granger-causality was computed with the squared partial directed coherence and showed no significant modulation during incremental isometric force generation.

Our findings indicate that the upper beta- and gamma-band power of subthalamic nucleus local field potentials are modulated by the physiological task of force generation in patients with Parkinson’s disease. This modulation seems to be not an effect of a modulation of peripheral feedback.

AB  - Maternal obesity carries significant health risks for offspring that manifest later in life, including metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease and affective disorders. Programming of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis during development mediates both metabolic homeostasis and the response to psychosocial stress in offspring. A diet high in fat alters maternal systemic corticosterone levels, but effects in offspring on limbic brain areas regulating the HPA axis and anxiety behavior are poorly understood. In addition to their role in the response to psychosocial stress, corticosteroid receptors form part of the glucocorticoid signaling pathway comprising downstream inflammatory processes. Increased systemic inflammation is a hallmark of high-fat diet exposure, though altered expression of these genes in limbic brain areas has not been examined. We studied the influence of high-fat diet exposure during pre-weaning development in rats on gene expression in the amygdala and hippocampus by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), anxiety behavior in the Open field, elevated plus maze and light–dark transition tasks, and corticosterone levels in response to stress by radioimmunoassay. As adults, offspring exposed to perinatal high-fat diet show increased expression of corticosterone receptors in the amygdala and altered pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory expression in the hippocampus and amygdala in genes known to be regulated by the glucocorticoid receptor. These changes were associated with increased anxiety behavior, decreased basal corticosterone levels and a slower return to baseline levels following a stress challenge. The data indicate that the dietary environment during development programs glucocorticoid signaling pathways in limbic areas relevant for the regulation of HPA function and anxiety behavior.

AB  - Abstract
Peripheral nerves, essential connections between the brain, spinal cord and body, do not regenerate as well as generally reported. Identifying new strategies to facilitate regeneration is essential to reversing neurological deficits from nerve injuries or disease. This review will discuss several selected and novel molecular insights into peripheral nerve trunk repair and axon regrowth that have the potential to improve regenerative success. Of particular interest is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway in peripheral neurons, inhibited by the constitutively expressed phosphatase tumor suppressor PTEN. Knockdown or inhibition of PTEN is associated with robust sprouting of adult sensory neurons in vitro and in vivo, additive to the accelerated outgrowth offered by the preconditioning effect. This sprouting response, if spatially and temporally constrained, may provide potent regrowth initiation, of interest in otherwise untreatable nerve damage.

AB  - Iron abnormalities within the brain are associated with several rare but severe neurodegenerative conditions. There is growing evidence that more common systemic iron loading disorders such as hemochromatosis can also have important effects on the brain. To identify features that are common across different forms of hemochromatosis, we used microarray and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to assess brain transcriptome profiles of transferrin receptor 2 mutant mice (Tfr2mut), a model of a rare type of hereditary hemochromatosis, relative to wildtype control mice. The results were compared with our previous findings in dietary iron-supplemented wildtype mice and Hfe−/− mice, a model of a common type of hereditary hemochromatosis. For transcripts showing significant changes relative to controls across all three models, there was perfect (100%) directional concordance (i.e. transcripts were increased in all models or decreased in all models). Comparison of the two models of hereditary hemochromatosis, which showed more pronounced changes than the dietary iron-supplemented mice, revealed numerous common molecular effects. Pathway analyses highlighted changes for genes relating to long-term depression (6.8-fold enrichment, p = 5.4 × 10−7) and, to a lesser extent, long-term potentiation (3.7-fold enrichment, p = 0.01), with generalized reductions in transcription of key genes from these pathways, which are involved in modulating synaptic strength and efficacy and are essential for memory and learning. The agreement across the models suggests the findings are robust and strengthens previous evidence that iron loading disorders affect the brain. Perturbations of brain phenomena such as long-term depression and long-term potentiation might partly explain neurologic symptoms reported for some hemochromatosis patients.

AB  - Alterations in serotonin (5-HT) neurochemistry have been implicated in the aetiology of all major neuropsychiatric disorders, ranging from schizophrenia to mood and anxiety-spectrum disorders. This review will focus on the multifaceted implications of 5-HT-ergic dysfunctions in the pathophysiology of aggressive and suicidal behaviours. After a brief overview of the anatomical distribution of the 5-HT-ergic system in the key brain areas that govern aggression and suicidal behaviours, the implication of 5-HT markers (5-HT receptors, transporter as well as synthetic and metabolic enzymes) in these conditions is discussed. In this regard, particular emphasis is placed on the integration of pharmacological and genetic evidence from animal studies with the findings of human experimental and genetic association studies.

Traditional views postulated an inverse relationship between 5-HT and aggression and suicidal behaviours; however, ample evidence has shown that this perspective may be overly simplistic, and that such pathological manifestations may reflect alterations in 5-HT homoeostasis due to the interaction of genetic, environmental and gender-related factors, particularly during early critical developmental stages. The development of animal models that may capture the complexity of such interactions promises to afford a powerful tool to elucidate the pathophysiology of impulsive aggression and suicidability, and identify new effective therapies for these conditions.

AB  - Our previous studies have demonstrated that application of the inflammatory irritant mustard oil (MO) to the tooth pulp produces trigeminal central sensitization that includes increases in mechanoreceptive field size and responses to noxious stimuli and decrease in activation threshold in brainstem nociceptive neurons of trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (the medullary dorsal horn, MDH). The aim of the present study was to test if central noradrenergic processes are involved in the central sensitization of MDH neurons and if α1-adrenoceptors or α2-adrenoceptors or both are involved. In urethane/α-chloralose-anesthetized rats, the activity of extracellularly recorded and functionally identified single nociceptive neurons in the MDH was studied. Continuous intrathecal (i.t.) superfusion of the adrenergic modulator guanethidine and α-adrenoceptor blocker phentolamine or selective α1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin over the medulla strongly attenuated all three MO-induced parameters of central sensitization in the MDH nociceptive neurons, compared to phosphate-buffered saline (as vehicle control). In contrast, i.t. superfusion of the selective α2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine had little effect on the mechanoreceptive field expansion and the decreased mechanical activation threshold, and indeed facilitated responses to noxious stimuli of sensitized nociceptive neurons. Superfusion of each of the four chemicals alone did not affect baseline nociceptive neuronal properties. These findings provide the first documentation of the involvement of central noradrenergic processes in MDH in the development of the central sensitization, and that α1- and α2-adrenoceptors may be differentially involved.

AB  - Adolescent experiences of social deprivation result in profound and enduring perturbations in adult behavior, including impaired sensorimotor gating. The behavioral deficits induced by adolescent social isolation in rats can be ameliorated by antipsychotic drugs blocking dopamine D2 receptors in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) or by chronic administration of a cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist. The patterning and abundance of D2 receptors in the PFC evolves concurrently with CB1 receptors through the period of adolescence. This evidence suggests that mature expression and/or surface distribution of D2 and CB1 receptors may be influenced by the adolescent social environment. We tested this hypothesis using electron microscopic immunolabeling to compare the distribution of CB1 and D2 receptors in the PFC of adult male Sprague–Dawley rats that were isolated or socially reared throughout the adolescent transition period. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle was assessed as a measure of sensorimotor gating. Social isolation reduced PPI and selectively decreased dendritic D2 immunogold labeling in the PFC. However, the decrease was only evident in dendrites that were not contacted by axon terminals containing CB1. There was no apparent change in the expression of CB1 or D2 receptors in presynaptic terminals. The D2 deficit therefore may be tempered by local CB1-mediated retrograde signaling. This suggests a biological mechanism whereby the adolescent social environment can persistently influence cortical dopaminergic activity and resultant behavior.

AB  - Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as an important class of molecules that regulate gene expression at epigenetic, transcriptional, and post-transcriptional levels through a wide array of mechanisms. This regulation is of particular importance in the central nervous system (CNS), where precise modulation of gene expression is required for proper neuronal and glial production, connection and function. There are relatively few functional studies that characterize lncRNA mechanisms, but possible functions can often be inferred based on existing examples and the lncRNA’s relative genomic position. In this review, we will discuss mechanisms of lncRNAs as predicted by genomic contexts and the possible impact on CNS development, function, and disease pathogenesis. There is no doubt that investigation of the mechanistic role of lncRNAs will open a new and exciting direction in studying CNS development and function.

AB  - Though the GluK4 kainate receptor subunit shows limited homology and a restricted expression pattern relative to other kainate receptor subunits, its ablation results in distinct behavioral and molecular phenotypes. GluK4 knockout mice demonstrated impairments in memory acquisition and recall in a Morris water maze test, suggesting a previously unreported role for kainate receptors in spatial memory. GluK4 knockout mice also showed marked hyperactivity and impaired pre-pulse inhibition, thereby mirroring two of the hallmark endophenotypes of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Furthermore, we found that GluK4 is a key mediator of excitotoxic neurodegeneration: GluK4 knockout mice showed robust neuroprotection in the CA3 region of the hippocampus following intrahippocampal injection of kainate and widespread neuroprotection throughout the hippocampus following hypoxia–ischemia. Biochemical analysis of kainate- or sham-treated wild-type and GluK4 knockout hippocampal tissue suggests that GluK4 may act through the JNK pathway to regulate the molecular cascades that lead to excitotoxicity. Together, our findings suggest that GluK4 may be relevant to the understanding and treatment of human neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Palatability is the hedonic food component that is considered to override the homeostatic mechanisms that control food intake, and we compared how much effort non food-deprived and food-deprived rats were willing to spend in order to earn a palatable caloric (sucrose) or non-caloric (saccharin) snack. We first studied the dopaminergic response, in terms of dopamine levels and dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein Mr 32,000 (DARPP-32) phosphorylation pattern, to two consecutive palatable caloric or non-caloric snacks in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcS) of non food-deprived and fasted rats. We report that non food-deprived rats developed rapid habituation in the NAcS dopaminergic response to the second consumption of both caloric and non-caloric palatable food, while food-deprived rats developed rapid habituation only to saccharin. Next, we show that in self-administration experiments, non food-deprived rats spent a similar effort when operating for sucrose or saccharin. However, the same rats showed an increased response specifically for sucrose after 18-h fasting. After pre-feeding devaluation, rats reduced their response to sucrose but not for saccharin.

These results strengthen the hypothesis that food intake is mainly controlled by palatability in non food-deprived rats and by caloric content in food-deprived rats. Moreover, they show that rapid habituation development was associated with a similar, basal working activity aimed at ingesting both caloric and non-caloric food, as observed in non food-deprived rats consuming sucrose or saccharin and in fasted rats consuming saccharin. Conversely, lack of habituation, as present in fasted rats consuming a caloric food, was associated with extra energy expenditure.

AB  - Hyperpolarisation-activated (Ih) currents are considered important for dendritic integration, synaptic transmission, setting membrane potential and rhythmic action potential (AP) discharge in neurons of the central nervous system. Hyperpolarisation-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels underlie these currents and are composed of homo- and hetero-tetramers of HCN channel subunits (HCN1–4), which confer distinct biophysical properties on the channel. Despite understanding the structure–function relationships of HCN channels with different subunit stoichiometry, our knowledge of their expression in defined neuronal populations remains limited. Recently, we have shown that HCN subunit expression is a feature of a specific population of dorsal horn interneurons that exhibit high-frequency AP discharge. Here we expand on this observation and use neuroanatomical markers to first identify well-characterised neuronal populations in the lumbar spinal cord and hippocampus and subsequently determine whether HCN4 expression correlates with high-frequency AP discharge in these populations. In the spinal cord, HCN4 is expressed in several putative inhibitory interneuron populations including parvalbumin (PV)-expressing islet cells (84.1%; SD: ±2.87), in addition to all putative Renshaw cells and Ia inhibitory interneurons. Similarly, virtually all PV-expressing cells in the hippocampal CA1 subfield (93.5%; ±3.40) and the dentate gyrus (90.9%; ±6.38) also express HCN4. This HCN4 expression profile in inhibitory interneurons mirrors both the prevalence of Ih sub-threshold currents and high-frequency AP discharge. Our findings indicate that HCN4 subunits are expressed in several populations of spinal and hippocampal interneurons, which are known to express both Ih sub-threshold currents and exhibit high-frequency AP discharge. As HCN channel function plays a critical role in pain perception, learning and memory, and sleep as well as the pathogenesis of several neurological diseases, these findings provide important insights into the identity and neurochemical status of cells that could underlie such conditions.

AB  - Experimental preconditioning provides beneficial outcomes in conditions such as cardiac surgery, brain surgery and stroke. Here we evaluated the protective effects of low-dose subcutaneous GYKI-52466 preconditioning in a rat model of hypoxic–ischaemic (HI) brain injury. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (postnatal day 26) were administered saline or GYKI-52466 (GYKI; 3-mg/kg, 90 min; 1-mg/kg, twice in 120 min; or 0.5-mg/kg, thrice in 180 min) prior to left common carotid artery occlusion. Animals were allowed to recover for 2 h, and then placed in a hypoxia chamber (8% O2/92% N2; 33 ± 1°C) for 1 h. A sham surgery group received saline without HI. Seizure activity was scored during hypoxia and sensorimotor tests performed before surgery and at 1, 7, 14 and 90 days post-HI. On days 14 and 90 brains were fixed and sectioned for the assessment of infarct size and ventricular enlargement. Low-dose GYKI-52466 preconditioning significantly reduced infarct volume and ventricular enlargement relative to saline-treated controls at day 14 after HI. On day 90, tissue loss was significantly reduced by GYKI 3-mg/kg compared to saline. Foot-faults, paw use asymmetry, and postural reflex scores were significantly improved in all GYKI treatment groups. Our results show that GYKI-52466 is effective at doses well-below, and at pre-administration intervals well-beyond previous studies, and suggest that a classical blockade of ionotropic AMPA receptors does not underlie its neuroprotective effects. Low-dose GYKI-52466 preconditioning represents a novel, prophylactic strategy for neuroprotection in a field almost devoid of effective pharmaceuticals.

AB  - Cisplatin, a chemotherapeutic agent for treating various solid tumors, produces hearing loss in approximately half a million cancer patients annually in the United States. In the course of developing a new protective agent against cisplatin-induced ototoxicity, we have been interested in a novel synthetic compound, 3-amino-3-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-1H-quinoline-2,4-dione (KR-22332). The effect of KR-22332 on cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity was analyzed in vitro in an organ of Corti-derived cell line (HEI-OC1), and in vivo in a zebrafish and rat model.

Cisplatin-induced apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and altered mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in HEI-OC1 cells were observed. KR-22332 significantly inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptosis, change of MMP, and intracellular ROS generation. KR-22332 markedly attenuated the cisplatin-induced loss and changes of auditory neuromasts in the zebrafish. Transtympanic administration of KR-22332 in a rat model was protective against cisplatin-induced hearing loss, as determined by click-evoked auditory brainstem response (p &lt; 0.01). Tissue terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling of rat cochlea demonstrated that KR-22332 blocked cisplatin-induced apoptosis. In addition, transtympanic administration of KR-22332 inhibited cisplatin-induced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase 3 (NOX3) overexpression in the rat cochlea. KR-22332 significantly reduced the expression of p-53, mitogen-activated protein kinases, caspase 3, and tumor necrosis factor-α compared to their significant increase after cisplatin treatment. The results of this study suggest that KR-22332 may prevent ototoxicity caused by the administration of cisplatin through the inhibition of mitochondrial dysfunction and the suppression of ROS generation. These novel findings implicate KR-22332 as a potential candidate for protective agent against cisplatin-induced ototoxicity.

AB  - Dopamine-derived neurotoxins, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (salsolinol) and 1(R),2(N)-dimethyl-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (NM-salsolinol) are the two most possible 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-like endogenous neurotoxin candidates that involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The levels of endogenously synthesized salsolinol and NM-salsolinol are increased in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of PD patients. Both of them lead to neurotoxicity in dopaminergic cells by inhibiting mitochondrial electron transport chain. To study the role of salsolinol and NM-salsolinol in Parkin deficiency-induced dopaminergic cell damage, we determined the cellular level of oxidative stress, the formation of salsolinol and NM-salsolinol, the level of mitochondrial damage and cell viability with/without the presence of exogenous H2O2 using differentiated dopaminergic PC12 cells. Our data show that parkin knock down elevates cellular oxidative stress, salsolinol and NM-salsolinol levels, which are responsible for the higher cell mortality in Parkin-deficient cells upon exposure to exogenous H2O2. The level of mitochondrial membrane potential loss, cristae disruption and the release of cytochrome c increased significantly along with the increased level of salsolinol and NM-salsolinol, whereas compared to parkin knock down cells in the presence of H2O2, the mitochondrial damage and higher cell mortality were both diminished when the levels of salsolinol and NM-salsolinol was reduced. The results not only indicate the elevated level of salsolinol and NM-salsolinol, but also reveal the potential role of salsolinol and NM-salsolinol in parkin knock down-induced cell vulnerability. We assume that parkin deficiency is the trigger of excessive oxidative stress, elevated endogenous neurotoxin levels and mitochondrial damage, which eventually results in cell death of dopaminergic cells.

AB  - In this study, we assessed the effects of varying tetanus and test-pulse intensity on the magnitude of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the perforant path–dentate gyrus projection of urethane-anaesthetized rats. We developed a novel within-subjects procedure in which test-pulse-stimulation intensity (60–1000 μA) was varied quasi-randomly under computer control throughout the recording period. After a baseline period, we applied a high-frequency tetanus, the intensity of which was varied over the same range as test-pulse intensity, but between subjects. The time-course of LTP was thus monitored continuously across a range of test-pulse intensities in each rat. Intense high-frequency tetanization at 1000 μA resulted in a paradoxical depression of the dentate field excitatory post-synaptic potential (fEPSP) slope at the lowest test intensity used (60 μA), but caused a potentiation at higher test intensities in the same animal. Moreover, intense tetanization induced less LTP than a moderate tetanus over most of the test-intensity range. Explanations for this pattern of data include a potentiation of feed-forward inhibition in conjunction with LTP of excitatory neurotransmission, or local tissue damage at the stimulation site. To address this issue, we conducted an additional experiment in which a second stimulating electrode was placed in the perforant path at a site closer to the dentate, in order to activate a common population of afferents at a location ‘downstream’ of the original stimulation site. After 1000-μA tetanization of the original (‘upstream’) site, fEPSPs were again depressed in response to test stimulation of the upstream site, but only potentiation was observed in response to stimulation of the downstream site. This is consistent with the idea that the depression induced by intense tetanization results from local changes at the stimulation site. In conclusion, while tetanus intensity must exceed the LTP induction threshold, intensities above 500 μA should be avoided; in the present study, tetanization at 250–500 μA yielded maximal levels of LTP.

AB  - Thrombin plays important roles in the pathology of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The recruitment of activated microglia, accompanied by thrombin-induced phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, contributes to ICH-associated neuron loss. Here we investigated the possibility that sesamin, a lignan of sesame seed oil, is a natural candidate as an inhibitor of microglial activation and MAPK pathways under ICH insults. Sesamin (30–100 μM) suppressed thrombin-induced nitric oxide (NO) production by primary-cultured rat microglia via inhibition of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) protein expression, independently of the antioxidative effect. Sesamin selectively inhibited p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation in the MAPK family (p38 and p44/42) involved in iNOS protein expression in primary-cultured rat microglia. An in vivo rat ICH model was prepared by intrastriatal injection of 0.20 U collagenase type IV unilaterally. ICH evoked the phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK, microglial proliferation with morphological change into the activated ameboid form, and neuron loss. The phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK was inhibited by intracerebroventricular administration of 30-nmol sesamin. Sesamin prevented ICH-induced increase of microglial cells in the perihematomal area. Notably, ramified microglia, the resting morphology, were observed in brain sections of the animals administrated sesamin. Sesamin furthermore achieved neuroprotection in the perihematomal area but not in the hematomal center. These results suggest that sesamin is a promising natural product as a novel therapeutic strategy based on the regulation of microglial activities accompanied by the activated p44/42 MAPK pathway in ICH.

AB  - Gonadal androgens are critical for the development and maintenance of sexually dimorphic regions of the male nervous system, which is critical for male-specific behavior and physiological functioning. In rodents, the motoneurons of the spinal nucleus of the bulbocavernosus (SNB) provide a useful example of a neural system dependent on androgen. Unless rescued by perinatal androgens, the SNB motoneurons will undergo apoptotic cell death. In adulthood, SNB motoneurons remain dependent on androgen, as castration leads to somal atrophy and dendritic retraction. In a second vertebrate model, the zebra finch, androgens are critical for the development of several brain nuclei involved in song production in males. Androgen deprivation during a critical period during postnatal development disrupts song acquisition and dimorphic size-associated nuclei. Mechanisms by which androgens exert masculinizing effects in each model system remain elusive. Recent studies suggest that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may play a role in androgen-dependent masculinization and maintenance of both SNB motoneurons and song nuclei of birds. This review aims to summarize studies demonstrating that BDNF signaling via its tyrosine receptor kinase (TrkB) receptor may work cooperatively with androgens to maintain somal and dendritic morphology of SNB motoneurons. We further describe studies that suggest the cellular origin of BDNF is of particular importance in androgen-dependent regulation of SNB motoneurons. We review evidence that androgens and BDNF may synergistically influence song development and plasticity in bird species. Finally, we provide hypothetical models of mechanisms that may underlie androgen- and BDNF-dependent signaling pathways.

AB  - Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is often characterized pathologically by severe neuronal loss in the hippocampus. In this study we investigated concomitant appearance of the pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic mechanisms in injured neurons in epileptic human hippocampi. Postsurgical hippocampal specimens of randomly selected 25 patients with MTLE were studied with standard immunohistochemical techniques to detect the below markers of cell death pathways: truncated Bid – tBid, mitochondrial translocation of Bax (markers of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein activation) and nuclear translocation of AIF (caspase-independent pro-apoptotic pathway). For cell survival pathways, we investigated the expression of c-IAP1, c-IAP2 and Hsp70 (heat shock protein). Immunopositive cells were counted in different regions of the hippocampus. We also verified IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) expression with Western blotting. The results were statistically compared with hippocampi from non-epileptic autopsy controls. In patient hippocampi, Bax and tBid immunoreactivity were significantly increased and Bax staining was consistent with mitochondrial translocation. AIF was not translocated to the nucleus. c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 were barely detectable in control hippocampi, whereas their expression was dramatically increased in the patients in all hippocampal subfields. Interestingly, these neurons were also positively co-labeled for tBid and translocated Bax. Hsp70 immunreactivity was significantly increased in all surviving neurons in patient hippocampi whereas degenerating neurons failed to express Hsp70. Our findings are consistent with both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic mechanisms being active within the same hippocampal neurons of patients with MTLE, illustrating an ongoing struggle between cell death and survival mechanisms in neurons under stress.

AB  - N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists mimic several symptoms of schizophrenia in healthy subjects, and are used in preclinical disease models. In the present study, the impact of pharmacologically and genetically induced NMDAR hypofunction was assessed in rats and mice, including the NMDAR hypomorphic (Grin1) mice, with respect to neuronal network oscillations. Field potentials were recorded from the ventro-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (CA1) in rats, as well as spontaneous and elicited hippocampal theta oscillations in response to brainstem stimulation in Grin1 and wild-type (WT) mice under anesthesia. Effects of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor positive allosteric modulator LY451395 were tested in Grin1 mice and in WT mice following an MK-801 challenge. Recordings from the mPFC and CA1 in rats revealed regular delta and theta oscillations, respectively, which were disrupted by MK-801. In WT mice, MK-801 reduced both spontaneous and elicited hippocampal theta power. Age-matched Grin1 mice showed abnormal hippocampal field potentials, resembling activity seen after administration of MK-801 in WT mice, but also epileptiform discharges. Administration of MK-801 achieved high levels of NMDAR occupancy (84–98%) in both rats and mice, which is comparable to the approximately 90–95% reduction of NMDAR expression in the Grin1 mouse. Impaired elicited CA1 theta oscillation in WT mice following MK-801, or Grin1 mice was significantly improved by LY451395. These findings demonstrate similar, although not identical, changes in network activity following reduction in functioning NMDARs induced by acute pharmacological or genetic manipulations, indicating that these novel neurophysiological models could be used in evaluating drug candidates targeting glutamate neurotransmission.

AB  - Because of their favorable action profiles in humans, both memantine and melatonin are particularly interesting candidates as neuroprotectants in acute ischemic stroke. Until now, the signaling mechanisms mediating memantine’s neuroprotective actions remained essentially uninvestigated. In addition, we have combined memantine with melatonin, which is a well-known neuroprotective molecule. Herein, we examined the effects of memantine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) administered alone or in combination with melatonin (4 mg/kg, i.p.) on the activation of signaling transduction pathways, IgG extravasation and ischemic injury in mice submitted to 90 min of intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion, followed by 24 h of reperfusion. In these studies, both agents reduced ischemic injury and the density of DNA-fragmentation. Notably, melatonin/memantine combination reduced ischemic injury further as compared with memantine treatment, which was associated with reduced IgG extravasation, indicating vascular leakage in the brain. Animals receiving memantine exhibited elevated ERK-1/2 and decreased p21 and p38/MAPK activations, while it had no significant effect on phosphorylated Akt and SAPK/JNK1/2 in the ischemic brain. However, melatonin increased the activation of Akt and reduced the activations of ERK-1/2, p21, p38/MAPK and SAPK/JNK1/2 significantly. Synergistic effects of memantine and melatonin were observed in the inactivation of p21, p38/MAPK and SAPK/JNK1/2 pathways. Moreover, memantine reversed the effects of melatonin on the activation of ERK-1/2 pathway. Here, we provide evidence that free radical scavenger melatonin potentiates the effects of memantine on ischemic brain injury via inactivations of p21 and stress kinases p38/MAPK and SAPK/JNK1/2 pathways.

AB  - Abstract
Maternal deprivation has been associated with physiological and developmental changes that may be related to an increased risk for childhood and adult neuropsychiatric diseases. A growing number of studies demonstrated the importance of childhood experiences in the development of psychosis and schizophrenia in adulthood. Therefore, the present study investigated different behavior responses in rats following maternal deprivation and/or ketamine treatment in adulthood. Male rats were subjected to maternal deprivation for 180 min from postnatal day-01 to postnatal day-10. We evaluated locomotor activity, avoidance task and social interaction of adult male rats deprived or not deprived that were administered with saline or acute subanesthetic doses of ketamine (5, 15 and 25 mg/kg, i.p.). Our results show that only ketamine (25 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment in the adult rats lead to hyperlocomotion but not ketamine (5 and 15 mg/kg) and maternal deprivation alone. However, maternally deprived rats treated with ketamine (5 mg/kg) induced hyperlocomotion. Additionally, ketamine (25 mg/kg) and maternal deprivation alone induced cognitive deficit in the avoidance task. Rats deprived of and treated with ketamine (5, 15 and 25 mg/kg) also lead to memory deficit. Moreover, ketamine (25 mg/kg) and maternal deprivation alone increased latency to start social behavior. However, ketamine (5 mg/kg) and maternal deprivation lead to an increase of latency to start social behavior. Biochemistry data showed that all doses of ketamine and ketamine plus maternal deprivation increased the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum. The major doses of ketamine associated with maternal deprivation induced a major increase of AChE activity. Together, our results suggest that animals subjected to maternal deprivation had an increased risk for schizophrenia-like behavior and cholinergic alteration.

AB  - Abstract
The transmembrane α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) are a family of auxiliary AMPA receptor subunits that differentially modulate trafficking and many functional properties of the receptor. To investigate which TARP isoforms may be involved in AMPA receptor-mediated spinal synaptic transmission, we have mapped the localization of five of the known TARP isoforms, namely γ-2 (also known as stargazin), γ-3, γ-4, γ-7 and γ-8, in the rat spinal cord. Immunoblotting showed expression of all isoforms in the spinal cord to varying degrees. At the light microscopic level, immunoperoxidase labeling of γ-4, γ-7 and γ-8 was found throughout spinal gray matter. In white matter, γ-4 and γ-7 immunolabeling was observed in astrocytic processes and in mature oligodendrocytes. In pepsin-treated spinal cord, γ-7 often colocalized with GluA2 immunopositive puncta in the deep dorsal horn as well as in the ventral horn, but not in the superficial dorsal horn. Postembedding immunogold labeling was further used to assess the synaptic localization of γ-2, γ-7 and γ-8 in the dorsal horn. Synaptic immunogold labeling of γ-2 was sparse throughout the dorsal horn, with some primary afferent synapses weakly labeled, whereas relatively strong γ-7 immunogold labeling was found at deep dorsal horn synapses, including at synapses formed by low-threshold mechanosensitive primary afferent terminals. Prominent immunogold labeling of γ-8 was frequently detected at synapses established by primary afferent fibers. The spinal localization patterns of TARP isoforms reported here suggest that AMPA receptors at spinal synaptic populations and in glial cells may exhibit different functional characteristics owing to differences in auxiliary subunit composition.

The hippocampus, derived from medial regions of the telencephalon, constitutes a remarkable brain structure. It is part of the limbic system, and it plays important roles in information encoding, related to short-term and long-term memory, and spatial navigation. It has also attracted the attention of many clinicians and neuroscientists for its involvement in a wide spectrum of pathological conditions, including epilepsy, intellectual disability, Alzheimer disease and others. Here we address the topic of hippocampal development. As well as original landmark findings, modern techniques such as large-scale in situ hybridizations, in utero electroporation and the study of mouse mutants with hippocampal phenotypes, add further detail to our knowledge of the finely regulated processes which form this intricate structure. Molecular signatures are being revealed related to field, intra-field and laminar cell identity, as well as, cell compartments expressing surface proteins instrumental for connectivity. We summarize here old and new findings, and highlight elegant tools used to fine-study hippocampal development.

AB  - Abstract
Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of kynurenic acid (KYNA) had sedative and hypnotic effects during stress in neonatal chicks. However, its mechanism has not been clarified. KYNA is an endogenous antagonist of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine (α7nACh) receptor and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Therefore, this study clarified the mechanism of sedative and hypnotic effects of KYNA in the brain during an acute stress. In Experiment 1, to investigate the relationship between KYNA and the α7nACh receptor, KYNA was injected i.c.v. with galantamine, an agonist of the allosteric potentiating site of the α7nACh receptor. Galantamine did not attenuate the effect of KYNA, but higher levels of galantamine caused harmful effects. In Experiment 2, the role of the NMDA receptor was investigated using the NMDA receptor antagonist (+)-MK-801, d-serine which has high affinity to a co-agonist glycine site at the NMDA receptors, NMDA as the NMDA receptor agonist, and 2,3-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (QUIN), an agonist of the NMDA receptor subgroup containing the subunits NR2A and NR2B. The behavioral changes following KYNA were partially attenuated by QUIN alone. In conclusion, we suggest that KYNA functioned via the simultaneous inhibition of the α7nACh receptor and NMDA receptor subgroup containing the subunits NR2A and NR2B.

AB  - Abstract
Photoperiodism is a biological phenomenon, common among organisms living outside of the tropics, by which environmental day length is used to ascertain the time of year to engage in seasonally-appropriate adaptations. White-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) are small photoperiodic rodents which display a suite of adaptive winter responses to short day lengths mediated by the extended duration of nightly melatonin secretion. Exposure to short days alters hippocampal dendritic morphology, impairs spatial learning and memory, and impairs hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). To determine the role of melatonin in these photoperiod-induced alterations of behavioral, neuroanatomical, and neurophysiological processes in this species, we implanted male mice subcutaneously with melatonin or empty Silastic capsules and exposed them to long or short day lengths. After 10 weeks, mice were assessed for hippocampal LTP, tested for spatial learning and memory in the Barnes maze, and morphometric analysis of neurons in the hippocampus using Golgi staining. Extending the duration of melatonin exposure, by short-day exposure or via melatonin implants, impaired both Schaffer collateral LTP in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and spatial learning and memory, and altered neuronal morphology in all hippocampal regions. The current results demonstrate that chronic melatonin implants reproduce the effects of short days on the hippocampus and implicate melatonin signaling as a critical factor in day-length-induced changes in the structure and function of the hippocampus in a photoperiodic rodent.

AB  - Abstract
The quality of motion perception depends on visual input during early development. Even 1 month of binocular deprivation (BD) from birth impairs motion coherence thresholds when tested in kittens; conversely BD with a 1-month delayed onset does not impair it (Mitchell et al., 2009). We showed that 6 months of BD applied from birth induces a selective impairment in a Global Motion Detection task, but not in global form perception, when tested in adulthood (Burnat et al., 2002, 2005). In these animals cell counts of the retinal motion-sensitive alpha ganglion revealed a life-long increase in OFF-type ganglion cell (Burnat et al., 2012). Here we examined in adult cats the effect of BD on global motion perception using an array of tasks with gradually increasing perceptual difficulty. Two conditions of BD were applied: from birth, lasting for 1, 2, 4 or 6 months, and with a delayed onset with first 2 months of normal vision followed by 2 months of BD. Cats deprived from birth for a 6-month period had Global Motion Detection impaired, as compared to the normal group. Velocity and low contrast-defined motion processing was impaired when BD was applied exclusively in months 3–4 of life. The cats deprived from birth for 1 or 2 months were not impaired in any of the tested motion tasks. Motion coherence thresholds, when tested at the end of a long motion training were not affected by BD and did not differ from those obtained for the normal group. Impaired extraction of low contrast-defined motion signal was found in cats deprived solely in months 3–4 of life. Surprisingly, binocular pattern deprivation during the first 2 months of life did not weaken motion sensitivity, revealing the occurrence of a critical period for motion perception later in development than previously suggested.

AB  - Abstract
Most investigations into the role of the body axis in vertebrate locomotion have focused on the trunk, although in most tetrapods, the tail also plays an active role. In salamanders, the tail contributes to propulsion during swimming and to dynamic balance and maneuverability during terrestrial locomotion. The aim of the present study was to obtain information concerning the neural mechanisms that produce tail muscle contractions during locomotion in the salamander Pleurodeles waltlii. We recorded the ventral root activities in in vitro spinal cord preparations in which locomotor-like activity was induced via bath application of N-methyl-d-aspartate (20 μM) and d-serine (10 μM).

Recordings showed that the tail spinal cord is capable of producing propagated waves of motor activity that alternate between the left and right sides. Lesion experiments further revealed that the tail rhythmogenic network is composed of a double chain of identical hemisegmental oscillators. Finally, using spinal cord preparations bathed in a chamber partitioned into two pools, we revealed efficient short-distance coupling between the trunk and tail networks. Together, our results demonstrate the existence of a pattern generator for rhythmic tail movements in the salamander and show that the global architecture of the tail network is similar to that previously proposed for the mid-trunk locomotor network in the salamander. Our findings further support the view that salamanders can control their trunk and tail independently during stepping movements. The relevance of our results in relation to the generation of tail muscle contractions in freely moving salamanders is discussed.

AB  - Abstract
Clinical stimulation of preterm infant breathing with methylxanthines like caffeine and theophylline can evoke seizures. It is unknown whether underlying neuronal hyperexcitability involves the rhythmogenic inspiratory active pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) in the brainstem or preBötC-driven motor networks. Inspiratory-related preBötC interneuronal plus spinal (cervical/phrenic) or cranial hypoglossal (XII) motoneuronal bursting was studied in newborn rat en bloc brainstem-spinal cords and brainstem slices, respectively. Non-respiratory bursting perturbed inspiratory cervical nerve activity in en bloc models at &gt;0.25 mM theophylline or caffeine. Rhythm in the exposed preBötC of transected en bloc preparations was less perturbed by 10 mM theophylline than cervical root bursting which was more affected than phrenic nerve activity. In the preBötC of slices, even 10 mM methylxanthine did not evoke seizure-like bursting whereas &gt;1 mM masked XII rhythm via large amplitude 1–10 Hz oscillations. Blocking A-type γ-aminobutyric (GABAA) receptors evoked seizure-like cervical activity whereas in slices neither XII nor preBötC rhythm was disrupted. Methylxanthines (2.5–10 mM), but not blockade of adenosine receptors, phosphodiesterase-4 or the sarcoplasmatic/endoplasmatic reticulum ATPase countered inspiratory depression by muscimol-evoked GABAA receptor activation that was associated with a hyperpolarization and input resistance decrease silencing preBötC neurons in slices. The latter blockers did neither affect preBötC or cranial/spinal motor network bursting nor evoke seizure-like activity or mask corresponding methylxanthine-evoked discharges. Our findings show that methylxanthine-evoked hyperexcitability originates from motor networks, leaving preBötC activity largely unaffected, and suggest that GABAA receptors contribute to methylxanthine-evoked seizure-like perturbation of spinal motoneurons whereas non-respiratory XII motoneuron oscillations are of different origin.
