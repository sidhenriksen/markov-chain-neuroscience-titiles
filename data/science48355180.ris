AB  - Abstract
Regret and relief are associated with counterfactual thinking and are sensitive to various social contexts. In the present fMRI study, we investigated the neural basis for regret and relief and how social context (following vs. not following advice) modulates them by employing a sequential risk-taking task. Participants were asked to open a series of boxes consecutively until they decided to stop. Each box contained a reward (gold), except for one that contained an adverse stimulus (devil), which caused the participant to lose all the gold collected in that trial. Before each trial, participants received advice about when to stop, which they then chose to follow or not. Behaviorally, subjective regret and relief were primarily dependent on the number of missed chances and the trade-off between obtained gains and missed chances, respectively. Participants felt less regret when they chose not to follow the advice than when they did. At the neural level, striatum, vmPFC/mOFC, and vACC activations were associated with greater relief. Meanwhile, dmPFC and left superior temporal gyrus were associated with greater regret. Additionally, dACC showed stronger activation in the Not-Follow context than the Follow context.

AB  - Abstract
The serotonergic system has often been defined as a neuromodulator system, and is specifically involved in learning and memory via its various receptors. Serotonin is involved in many of the same processes affected by cannabinoids. The present study investigated the influence of bilateral post-training intra-prelimbic (PL) administrations of serotonergic 5-hydroxytryptamine type-3 (5-HT3) receptor agents on arachidonylcyclopropylamide (ACPA) (cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist)-induced amnesia, using the step-through inhibitory avoidance (IA) task to assess memory in adult male Sprague–Dawley rats. The results indicated that sole intra-PL microinjection of ACPA (0.1 and 0.5 μg/rat) and 5-HT3 serotonin receptor agonist (m-Chlorophenylbiguanide hydrochloride, m-CPBG; 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 μg/rat) impaired, whereas Y-25130 (a selective 5-HT3 serotonin receptor antagonist; 0.001 and 0.01 and 0.1 μg/rat) did not alter IA memory consolidation, by itself. Moreover, intra-PL administration of subthreshold dose of m-CPBG (0.0005 μg/rat) potentiated, while Y-25130 (0. 1 μg/rat) restored ACPA-induced memory consolidation deficit. The isobologram analysis showed that there is a synergistic effect between ACPA and m-CPBG on memory consolidation deficit. These findings suggest that 5-HT3 receptor mechanism(s), at least partly, play(s) a role in modulating the effect of ACPA on memory consolidation in the PL area.

AB  - Abstract
Intrinsic plasticity has emerged as an important mechanism regulating neuronal excitability and output under physiological and pathological conditions. Here, we report a novel form of intrinsic plasticity. Using perforated patch clamp recordings, we examined the modulatory effects of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR II) on voltage-gated potassium (KV) currents and the firing properties of neurons in the chicken nucleus laminaris (NL), the first central auditory station where interaural time cues are analyzed for sound localization. We found that activation of mGluR II by synthetic agonists resulted in a selective increase of the high-threshold KV currents. More importantly, synaptically released glutamate (with reuptake blocked) also enhanced the high-threshold KV currents. The enhancement was frequency-coding region dependent, being more pronounced in low-frequency neurons compared to middle- and high-frequency neurons. The intracellular mechanism involved the Gβγ signaling pathway associated with phospholipase C and protein kinase C. The modulation strengthened membrane outward rectification, sharpened action potentials, and improved the ability of NL neurons to follow high-frequency inputs. These data suggest that mGluR II provides a feedforward modulatory mechanism that may regulate temporal processing under the condition of heightened synaptic inputs.

AB  - Abstract
As disturbance in auditory steady-state response (ASSR) has been consistently found in many neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, there is considerable interest in the development of translational rat models to elucidate the underlying neural and neurochemical mechanisms involved in ASSR. This is the first study to investigate the effects of the non-selective muscarinic antagonist scopolamine and the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil (also in combination with scopolamine) on ASSR. We recorded the local field potentials through the chronic microelectrodes implanted in the auditory cortex of freely moving rat. ASSRs were recorded in response to auditory stimuli delivered over a range of frequencies (10–80 Hz) and averaged over 60 trials. We found that a single dose of scopolamine produced a temporal attenuation in response to auditory stimuli; the most attenuation occurred at 40 Hz. Time–frequency analysis revealed deficits in both power and phase-locking to 40 Hz. Donepezil augmented 40-Hz steady-state power and phase-locking. Scopolamine combined with donepezil had an enhanced effect on the phase-locking, but not power of ASSR. These changes induced by cholinergic drugs suggest an involvement of muscarinic neurotransmission in auditory processing and provide a rodent model investigating the neurochemical mechanism of neurophysiological deficits seen in patients.

AB  - Abstract
l-DOPA is the primary pharmacological treatment for relief of the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). With prolonged treatment (⩾5 years) the majority of patients will develop abnormal involuntary movements as a result of l-DOPA treatment, known as l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of dyskinesia is a crucial step toward developing treatments for this debilitating side effect. We used the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of PD treated with a three-week dosing regimen of l-DOPA plus the dopa decarboxylase inhibitor benserazide (4 mg/kg and 7.5 mg/kg s.c., respectively) to induce dyskinesia in 50% of individuals. We then used RNA-seq to investigate the differences in mRNA expression in the striatum of dyskinetic animals, non-dyskinetic animals, and untreated parkinsonian controls at the peak of dyskinesia expression, 60 min after l-DOPA administration. Overall, 255 genes were differentially expressed; with significant differences in mRNA expression observed between all three groups. In dyskinetic animals 129 genes were more highly expressed and 14 less highly expressed when compared with non-dyskinetic and untreated parkinsonian controls. In l-DOPA treated animals 42 genes were more highly expressed and 95 less highly expressed when compared with untreated parkinsonian controls. Gene set cluster analysis revealed an increase in expression of genes associated with the cytoskeleton and phosphoproteins in dyskinetic animals compared with non-dyskinetic animals, which is consistent with recent studies documenting an increase in synapses in dyskinetic animals. These genes may be potential targets for drugs to ameliorate l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia or as an adjunct treatment to prevent their occurrence.

AB  - Abstract
The importance of astrocyte heterogeneity came out as a hot topic in neurosciences especially over the last decades, when the development of new methodologies allowed demonstrating the existence of big differences in morphological, neurochemical and physiological features between astrocytes. However, although the knowledge about the biology of astrocytes is increasing rapidly, an important characteristic that remained unexplored, until the last years, has been the relationship between astrocyte lineages and cell heterogeneity. To fill this gap, a new method called StarTrack was recently developed, a powerful genetic tool that allows tracking astrocyte lineages forming cell clones. Using StarTrack, a single astrocyte progenitor and its progeny can be specifically labeled from its generation, during embryonic development, to its final fate in the adult brain. Because of this specific labeling, astrocyte clones, exhibiting heterogeneous morphologies and features, can be easily analyzed in relation to their ontogenetic origin. This review summarizes how astrocyte heterogeneity can be decoded studying the embryonic development of astrocyte lineages and their clonal relationship. Finally, we discuss about some of the challenges and opportunities emerging in this exciting area of investigation.

AB  - Abstract
Astrocytes are fundamental for homoeostasis, defence and regeneration of the central nervous system. Loss of astroglial function and astroglial reactivity contributes to the aging of the brain and to neurodegenerative diseases. Changes in astroglia in aging and neurodegeneration are highly heterogeneous and region-specific. In animal models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) astrocytes undergo degeneration and atrophy at the early stages of pathological progression, which possibly may alter the homeostatic reserve of the brain and contribute to early cognitive deficits. At later stages of AD reactive astrocytes are associated with neurite plaques, the feature commonly found in animal models and in human diseased tissue. In animal models of the AD reactive astrogliosis develops in some (e.g. in the hippocampus) but not in all regions of the brain. For instance, in entorhinal and prefrontal cortices astrocytes do not mount gliotic response to emerging β-amyloid deposits. These deficits in reactivity coincide with higher vulnerability of these regions to AD-type pathology. Astroglial morphology and function can be regulated through environmental stimulation and/or medication suggesting that astrocytes can be regarded as a target for therapies aimed at the prevention and cure of neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Abstract
The hypothalamus controls feeding behavior. Since central opioid systems may regulate feeding behavior, we examined the role of μ-, δ- and κ-opioid receptors in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), the hunger center, in feeding behavior of mice. Non-selective (naloxone; 3 mg/kg, s.c.) and selective μ- (β-funaltrexamine, β-FNA; 10 mg/kg, s.c.), δ- (naltrindole; 3 mg/kg, s.c.) and κ- (norbinaltorphimine, norBNI; 20 mg/kg, s.c.) opioid receptor antagonists significantly decreased food intake in food-deprived mice. The injection of naloxone (20 μg/side) into the LH significantly decreased food intake whereas the injection of naloxone (20 μg/side) outside of the LH did not affect food intake. The injection of β-FNA (2 μg/side), naltrindole (1 μg/side) or norBNI (2 μg/side) into the LH significantly decreased food intake. Furthermore, all these antagonists significantly decreased the mRNA level of preproorexin, but not those of other hypothalamic neuropeptides. In addition, the injection of the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol (5 μg/side) into the LH significantly decreased food intake, and this effect was abolished by the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (50 μg/side). Muscimol (1 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased the mRNA level of preproorexin in the hypothalamus. Naloxone (3 mg/kg, s.c.) significantly increased the GABA level in the LH and both bicuculline and the GABA release inhibitor 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MP, 5 μg/side) attenuated the inhibitory effect of naloxone on feeding behavior. 3-MP also attenuated the effects of β-FNA and norBNI, but not that of naltrindole. These results show that opioid systems in the LH regulate feeding behavior through orexin neurons. Moreover, μ- and κ-, but not δ-, opioid receptor antagonists inhibit feeding behavior by activating GABA neurons in the LH.

AB  - Abstract
Auditory feedback plays an important role in the acquisition of fluent speech; however, this role may change once speech is acquired and individuals no longer experience persistent developmental changes to the brain and vocal tract. For this reason, we investigated whether the role of auditory feedback in sensorimotor learning differs across children and adult speakers. Participants produced vocalizations while they heard their vocal pitch predictably or unpredictably shifted downward one semitone. The participants’ vocal pitches were measured at the beginning of each vocalization, before auditory feedback was available, to assess the extent to which the deviant auditory feedback modified subsequent speech motor commands. Sensorimotor learning was observed in both children and adults, with participants’ initial vocal pitch increasing following trials where they were exposed to predictable, but not unpredictable, frequency-altered feedback. Participants’ vocal pitch was also measured across each vocalization, to index the extent to which the deviant auditory feedback was used to modify ongoing vocalizations. While both children and adults were found to increase their vocal pitch following predictable and unpredictable changes to their auditory feedback, adults produced larger compensatory responses. The results of the current study demonstrate that both children and adults rapidly integrate information derived from their auditory feedback to modify subsequent speech motor commands. However, these results also demonstrate that children and adults differ in their ability to use auditory feedback to generate compensatory vocal responses during ongoing vocalization. Since vocal variability also differed across the children and adult groups, these results also suggest that compensatory vocal responses to frequency-altered feedback manipulations initiated at vocalization onset may be modulated by vocal variability.

AB  - Abstract
Glycinergic neurons provide an important mechanism to control excitation of motoneurons in the brainstem and a reduction or loss of glycinergic inhibition can be deleterious by leading to hyperexcitation such as in hyperekplexia or neurodegeneration and neuronal death as in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Second messenger systems that change cyclic AMP and lead to phosphorylation of the α3 subunit of the glycine receptor (GlyR α3) have been shown to be potent modulators of synaptic inhibition in the spinal cord and brain stem. In this study we analyzed the role of GlyR α3 in synaptic inhibition to the hypoglossal nucleus using Glra3 (the gene encoding the glycine receptor α3 subunit) knockout mice. We observed that baseline glycinergic synaptic transmission to nucleus of hypoglossal motoneurons is rather normal in Glra3 knockout mice. Interestingly, we found that the modulation of synaptic transmission by cAMP-mediated pathways appeared to be reduced in Glra3 knockout mice. In the second postnatal week the forskolin-induced increase of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic potential (mIPSC) frequency was significantly larger in control as compared to Glra3 knockout mice suggesting that presynaptic glycine release in the hypoglossal nucleus is partially depending on GlyR α3.

This meta-analysis aims to investigate the association between mutations of glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene and susceptibility to Parkinson’s disease (PD) in a European population. Several electronic databases were extensively searched. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the association. In total, fourteen published papers screening L444P, N370S and other GBA variants were identified. The GBA mutations were significantly associated with PD in the European population. Subgroup analysis stratified by the age of onset (AAO) revealed that the association between GBA mutations and PD existed in the patients with age at onset ⩽50 years but did not exist in the patients with age at onset &gt;50 years. Furthermore, the associations between N370S, and L444P with PD were also analyzed to explore the roles of the two most frequent GBA mutations in the development of PD. The results showed that significant associations between N370S, and L444P with PD were observed, respectively. Overall, the study supported that GBA mutations were a risk factor for PD in the European population. Patients with early-onset were more likely to carry GBA mutations than those with late-onset. Moreover, both L444P and N370S were associated with increased PD risk.

AB  - Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by difficulties in communication and social interactions, restricted, repetitive behaviors and sensory abnormalities. Notably, the vast majority of individuals with ASD experience some degree of auditory dysfunction and we have recently reported consistent hypoplasia and dysmorphology in auditory brainstem centers in individuals with ASD. Prenatal exposure to the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA) is associated with an increased risk of ASD. In rodents, prenatal exposure to VPA is employed as an animal model of ASD and is associated with a number of anatomical, physiological and behavioral deficits, including hypoplasia and dysmorphology of auditory brainstem centers. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that such dysmorphology in VPA-exposed animals would translate into abnormal neuronal activity in brainstem circuits and irregular tonotopic maps. Herein, we have subjected control and VPA-exposed animals to 4- or 16-kHz tones and examined neuronal activation with immunohistochemistry for c-Fos. After these exposures, we identified significantly more c-Fos-positive neurons in the auditory brainstem of VPA-exposed animals. Additionally, we observed a larger dispersion of c-Fos-positive neurons and shifted tonotopic bands in VPA-exposed rats. We interpret these findings to suggest hyper-responsiveness to sounds and disrupted mapping of sound frequencies after prenatal VPA exposure. Based on these findings, we suggest that such abnormal patterns of activation may play a role in auditory processing deficits in ASD.

AB  - Abstract
Loss-of-function mutations in the progranulin gene (GRN) are a common cause of familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). A high degree of heterogeneity in the age-of-onset, duration of disease, and clinical presentation of FTLD, even among families carrying the same GRN mutation, suggests that additional modifying genes may be important to pathogenesis. Progranulin-knockout mice display subtle behavioral abnormalities and progressive neuropathological changes, as well as altered dendritic morphology and synaptic deficits in the hippocampus. In this study we evaluated multiple neuropathological endpoints in aged progranulin knockout mice and their wild-type littermates on two different genetic backgrounds: C57Bl/6 and 129/SvImJ. We find that in most brain regions, both strains are susceptible to progranulin-mediated neuropathological phenotypes, including astrogliosis, microgliosis, and highly accelerated deposition of the aging pigment lipofuscin. Neuroinflammation due to progranulin deficiency is exaggerated in the B6 strain and present, but less pronounced, in the 129 strain. Differences between the strains in hippocampal neuron counts and neuronal morphology suggest a complex role for progranulin in the hippocampus. We conclude that core progranulin-mediated neurodegenerative phenotypes are penetrant on multiple inbred mouse strains, but that genetic background modulates progranulin’s role in neuroinflammation and hippocampal biology.

AB  - Abstract
It is well established that multisensory integration is a functional characteristic of the superior colliculus that disambiguates external stimuli and therefore reduces the reaction times toward simple audiovisual targets in space. However, in a condition where a complex audiovisual stimulus is used, such as the optical flow in the presence of modulated audio signals, little is known about the processing of the multisensory integration in the superior colliculus. Furthermore, since visual and auditory deficits constitute hallmark signs during aging, we sought to gain some insight on whether audiovisual processes in the superior colliculus are altered with age. Extracellular single-unit recordings were conducted in the superior colliculus of anesthetized Sprague–Dawley adult (10–12 months) and aged (21–22 months) rats. Looming circular concentric sinusoidal (CCS) gratings were presented alone and in the presence of sinusoidally amplitude modulated white noise. In both groups of rats, two different audiovisual response interactions were encountered in the spatial domain: superadditive, and suppressive. In contrast, additive audiovisual interactions were found only in adult rats. Hence, superior colliculus audiovisual interactions were more numerous in adult rats (38%) than in aged rats (8%). These results suggest that intersensory interactions in the superior colliculus play an essential role in space processing toward audiovisual moving objects during self-motion. Moreover, aging has a deleterious effect on complex audiovisual interactions.

AB  - Abstract
Astrocytes are the largest glial population in the mammalian brain. Astrocytes in the cerebral cortex are reportedly generated from four sources, namely radial glia, progenitors in the subventricular zone (SVZ progenitors), locally proliferating glia, and NG2 glia; it remains an open question, however, as to what extent these four cell types contribute to the substantial increase in astrocytes that occurs postnatally in the cerebral cortex. Here we summarize all possible sources of astrocytes and discuss their roles in this postnatal increase. In particular, we focus on astrocytes derived from local proliferation within the cortex.

AB  - Abstract
To investigate the feedback effect from area 7 to areas 17 and 18, intrinsic signal optical imaging combined with pharmacological, morphological methods and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was employed. A spatial frequency-dependent decrease in response amplitude of orientation maps was observed in areas 17 and 18 when area 7 was inactivated by a local injection of GABA, or by a lesion induced by liquid nitrogen freezing. The pattern of orientation maps of areas 17 and 18 after the inactivation of area 7, if they were not totally blurred, paralleled the normal one. In morphological experiments, after one point at the shallow layers within the center of the cat’s orientation column of area 17 was injected electrophoretically with HRP (horseradish peroxidase), three sequential patches in layers 1, 2 and 3 of area 7 were observed. Employing fMRI it was found that area 7 feedbacks mainly to areas 17 and 18 on ipsilateral hemisphere. Therefore, our conclusions are: (1) feedback from area 7 to areas 17 and 18 is spatial frequency modulated; (2) feedback from area 7 to areas 17 and 18 occurs mainly ipsilaterally; (3) histological feedback pattern from area 7 to area 17 is weblike.

AB  - Abstract
A major pathological hallmark in several neurodegenerative disorders, like polyglutamine disorders (polyQ), including Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), is the formation of protein aggregates. MJD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene, resulting in an abnormal protein, which is prone to misfolding and forms cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregates within neurons, ultimately inducing neurodegeneration.

Treatment of proteinopathies with drugs that up-regulate autophagy has shown promising results in models of polyQ diseases. Temsirolimus (CCI-779) inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (m-TOR), while lithium chloride (LiCl) acts by inhibiting inositol monophosphatase, both being able to induce autophagy.

We have previously shown that chronic treatment with LiCl (10.4 mg/kg) had limited effects in a transgenic MJD mouse model. Also, others have shown that CCI-779 had mild positive effects in a different mouse model of the disease. It has been suggested that the combination of mTOR-dependent and -independent autophagy inducers could be a more effective therapeutic approach. To further explore this avenue toward therapy, we treated CMVMJD135 transgenic mice with a conjugation of CCI-779 and LiCl, both at concentrations known to induce autophagy and not to be toxic. Surprisingly, this combined treatment proved to be deleterious to both wild-type (wt) and transgenic animals, failing to rescue their neurological symptoms and actually exerting neurotoxic effects.

These results highlight the possible dangers of manipulating autophagy in the nervous system and suggest that a better understanding of the potential disruption in the autophagy pathway in MJD is required before successful long-term autophagy modulating therapies can be developed.

AB  - Abstract
The Forkead Box G1 (FOXG1 in humans, Foxg1 in mice) gene encodes for a DNA-binding transcription factor, essential for the development of the telencephalon in mammalian forebrain. Mutations in FOXG1 have been reported to be involved in the onset of Rett Syndrome, for which sequence alterations of MECP2 and CDKL5 are known. While visual alterations are not classical hallmarks of Rett syndrome, an increasing body of evidence shows visual impairment in patients and in MeCP2and CDKL5 animal models. Herein we focused on the functional role of FOXG1 in the visual system of animal models (Foxg1+/Cre mice) and of a cohort of subjects carrying FOXG1 mutations or deletions. Visual physiology of Foxg1+/Cre mice was assessed by visually evoked potentials, which revealed a significant reduction in response amplitude and visual acuity with respect to wild-type littermates. Morphological investigation showed abnormalities in the organization of excitatory/inhibitory circuits in the visual cortex. No alterations were observed in retinal structure. By examining a cohort of FOXG1-mutated individuals with a panel of neuro-ophthalmological assessments, we found that all of them exhibited visual alterations compatible with high-level visual dysfunctions. In conclusion our data show that Foxg1 haploinsufficiency results in an impairment of mouse and human visual cortical function.

AB  - Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a series of neurodevelopmental disorders that are characterized by deficits in both social and cognitive functions. Although the exact etiology and pathology of ASD remain unclear, a disorder of the microbiota–gut–brain axis is emerging as a prominent factor in the generation of autistic behaviors. Clinical studies have shown that gastrointestinal symptoms and compositional changes in the gut microbiota frequently accompany cerebral disorders in patients with ASD. A disturbance in the gut microbiota, which is usually induced by a bacterial infection or chronic antibiotic exposure, has been implicated as a potential contributor to ASD. The bidirectional microbiota–gut–brain axis acts mainly through neuroendocrine, neuroimmune, and autonomic nervous mechanisms. Application of modulators of the microbiota–gut–brain axis, such as probiotics, helminthes and certain special diets, may be a promising strategy for the treatment of ASD. This review mainly discusses the salient observations of the disruptions of the microbiota–gut–brain axis in the pathogenesis of ASD and reveals its potential therapeutic role in autistic deficits.

AB  - Abstract
Given the strong relationship between human olfaction and emotion, it is not surprising that numerous studies have investigated human response to hedonic and arousing qualities of odors. However, neuropsychological research addressed rather the pleasant–unpleasant, and not the arousing–calming dimension of emotional states generated by odorants. The purpose of the presented fMRI study was to evaluate the differences in cerebral processing of olfactory stimuli, focusing on both of these dimensions of emotional experiences, i.e., pleasantness and arousal. We investigated the patterns of activation generated by odors differing in hedonic tone and generated arousal while controlling the stimuli intensity. This design allowed for a new insight to the emotional odor processing with imaging techniques. The pleasantness was related to activation in the cingulate gyrus, the insula, the hippocampal area, the amygdala, and the superior temporal gyrus, whereas arousal affected activation in the thalamic relay. The present study showed also that the emotional states generated by arousing qualities of odorants are an important determinant of magnitude of cerebral activation.

AB  - Abstract
Chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs/DSPGs) are major components of the extracellular matrix. Their expression is generally upregulated after injuries to the adult mammalian central nervous system, which is known for its low ability to restore function after injury. Several studies support the view that CSPGs inhibit regeneration after injury, whereas the functions of DSPGs in injury paradigms are less certain. To characterize the functions of DSPGs in the presence of CSPGs, we studied young adult dermatan-4O-sulfotransferase1-deficient (Chst14−/−) mice, which express chondroitin sulfates (CSs), but not dermatan sulfates (DSs), to characterize the functional outcome after severe compression injury of the spinal cord. In comparison to their wild-type (Chst14+/+) littermates, regeneration was reduced in Chst14−/− mice. No differences between genotypes were seen in the size of spinal cords, numbers of microglia and astrocytes neither in intact nor injured spinal cords after injury. Monoaminergic innervation and re-innervation of the spinal cord caudal to the lesion site as well as expression levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and myelin basic protein (MBP) were similar in both genotypes, independent of whether they were injured and examined 6 weeks after injury or not injured. These results suggest that, in contrast to CSPGs, DSPGs, being the products of Chst14 enzymatic activity, promote regeneration after injury of the adult mouse central nervous system.

AB  - Abstract
Prostaglandin-E2 (PGE2) is a very important inflammatory mediator and PGE2-mediated neuroexcitation in sex-specific distribution of Ah-type trigeminal ganglion neurons (TGNs) isolated from adult female rats is not fully addressed. The whole-cell patch-clamp experiment was performed to verify the effects of PGE2, forskolin, and GPR30-selective agonist (G-1) on action potential (AP) and tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) Na+ currents in identified Ah-type TGNs. The results showed that the firing frequency was increased in Ah- and C-types by PGE2, which was simulated by forskolin and inhibited by Rp-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), while G-1 mimicked this effect only in Ah-types, which was abolished by GPR30-selective antagonist (G-15). Although the amplitude of AP was increased in Ah- and C-types, increased maximal upstroke velocity was confirmed only in Ah-types, suggesting distinct alternations in current density and/or voltage-dependent property of Na+ channels. With 1.0 μM PGE2, TTX-R Na+ currents were upregulated without changing the current–voltage relationship and voltage-dependent activation in C-types, however, the TTX-R Na+ current was augmented in Ah-types, peaked voltage and the voltage-dependent activation were both shifted toward hyperpolarized direction with faster slope. Intriguingly, the low-threshold persistent TTX-R component was activated from −60 mV and increased almost double at −30 mV compared with ∼30–40% increment of TTX-R component being activated at ∼−10 mV. Additionally, the change in TTX-R component of Ah-types was equivalent well with that in C-type TGNs. Taken these data together, we conclude that PGE2 modulates the neuroexcitation via cAMP-mediated upregulation of TTX-R Na+ currents in both cell-types with hormone-dependent feature, especially persistent TTX-R Na+ currents in sex-specific distribution of myelinated Ah-type TGNs.

AB  - Abstract
Diabetes mellitus correlates with subsequent development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). An accumulation of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) was observed in AD brains. We found previously that inhibiting peroxisomal β-oxidation by an inhibitor caused increases in VLCFA and β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) in the cortex and primary cultured neurons of rats. Therefore, we investigated whether there was an impaired peroxisomal β-oxidation and elevated VLCFA related to the increased Aβ in the diabetic brain. This study was conducted in a type 2 diabetic rat model induced by a high-fat diet and low-dose streptozotocin. A decrease in peroxisomal β-oxidation activity caused by down-regulated thiolase expression and a consequent increase in C26:0 were observed. Meanwhile, decreases in eicosapentenoic acid (EPA) and increases in oxidative stress [indicated by levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), and the protein expression of NOX4, p47phox and HO-1], Aβ, and the expression of AβPP and BACE1, two proteins involved in Aβ production, were observed. C26:0 levels were positively correlated with Aβ and MDA. This work suggests that in addition to decreases in EPA, increases in C26:0 by impaired peroxisomal β-oxidation can be a potential risk factor contributing to the progression of AD in diabetic brains via inducing oxidative stress.

AB  - Abstract
Women are more likely than men to suffer from anxiety disorders and major depression. These disorders share hyperresponsiveness to stress as an etiological factor. Thus, sex differences in brain arousal systems and their regulation by chronic stress may account for the increased vulnerability to these disorders in women. Social isolation is a model of early life stress that results in neurobiological alterations leading to increased anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors. Here we investigated the sex difference in the effects of post-weaning social isolation on acute stress sensitivity and behavior in rats. In both sexes, social isolation at weaning reduced basal levels of the neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone in the brain and of corticosterone in plasma. Moreover, acute stress increased plasma corticosterone levels in both group-housed and socially isolated male and female rats; however this effect was greater in male than female rats subjected to social isolation. Intriguingly, group-housed female rats showed no change in plasma and brain levels of allopregnanolone after acute foot-shock stress. The absence of stress-induced effects on allopregnanolone synthesis might be due to the physiologically higher levels of this hormone in females vs. males. Accordingly, increasing allopregnanolone levels in male rats blunted the response to foot-shock stress in these animals. Socially isolated male, but not female, rats also display depressive-like behavior and increased hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The ovarian steroids could “buffer” the effect of this adverse experience in females on these parameters. Finally, the dexamethasone (DEX) suppression test indicated that the chronic stress associated with social isolation impairs feedback inhibition in both sexes in which an increase in the abundance of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) in the hippocampus was found. Altogether, these results demonstrate that social isolation affects neuroendocrine reactivity to stress, plasticity and emotionality in a sexually dimorphic manner.

AB  - Abstract
The mammalian circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is a heterogeneous structure. Two key populations of cells that receive retinal input and are believed to participate in circadian responses to light are cells that contain vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP). VIP acts primarily through the VPAC2 receptor, while GRP works primarily through the BB2 receptor. Both VIP and GRP phase shift the circadian clock in a manner similar to light when applied to the SCN, both in vivo and in vitro, indicating that they are sufficient to elicit photic-like phase shifts. However, it is not known if they are necessary signals for light to elicit phase shifts. Here we test the hypothesis that GRP and VIP are necessary signaling components for the photic phase shifting of the hamster circadian clock by examining two antagonists for each of these neuropeptides. The BB2 antagonist PD176252 had no effect on light-induced delays on its own, while the BB2 antagonist RC-3095 had the unexpected effect of significantly potentiating both phase delays and advances. Neither of the VIP antagonists ([d-p-Cl-Phe6, Leu17]-VIP, or PG99-465) altered phase shifting responses to light on their own. When the BB2 antagonist PD176252 and the VPAC2 antagonist PG99-465 were delivered together to the SCN, phase delays were significantly attenuated. These results indicate that photic phase shifting requires participation of either VIP or GRP; phase shifts to light are only impaired when signalling in both pathways are inhibited. Additionally, the unexpected potentiation of light-induced phase shifts by RC-3095 should be investigated further for potential chronobiotic applications.

AB  - Abstract
Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) is a phylogenetically ancient neurotrophic hormone with crucial roles to play in CNS development and maturation. Recently, IGF-1 has been shown to have potent effects on cellular neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticty refers to the adaptive changes made by the CNS in the face of changing functional demands and is crucial in processes such as learning and memory. IGF-1, signaling through its glycoprotein receptor (IGF-1R), and canonical signaling pathways such as the PI3K-Akt and Ras-Raf-MAP pathways, has potent effects on cellular neuroplasticity in the CNS. In the present review, the role of IGF-1 in brain development is reviewed, followed by a detailed discussion of the role played by IGF in cellular neuroplasticity in the CNS. Findings from models of perturbed and reparative plasticity detailing the role played by IGF-1 are discussed, followed by the electrophysiological, structural and functional evidence supporting this role. Finally, the post-lesion and post-injury roles played by IGF-1 are briefly evaluated. We discuss the putative neurobiology underlying these changes, reviewing recent evidence and highlighting areas for further research.

AB  - Abstract
Cellular differentiation is the process, by which a cell changes from one cell type to another, preferentially to the more specialized one. Calcium fluxes play an important role in this action. Differentiated NG108-15 or PC12 cells serve as models for studying neuronal pathways. NG108-15 cell line is a reliable model of cholinergic neuronal cells. These cells differentiate to a neuronal phenotype due to the dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP) treatment. We have shown that a slow sulfide donor – GYY4137 – can also act as a differentiating factor in NG108-15 cell line. Calcium is an unavoidable ion required in NG108-15 cell differentiation by both, dbcAMP and GYY4137, since cultivation in EGTA completely prevented differentiation of these cells. In this work we focused primarily on the role of reticular calcium in the process of NG108-15 cell differentiation. We have found that dbcAMP and also GYY4137 decreased reticular calcium concentration by different mechanisms. GYY4137 caused a rapid decrease in type 2 sarco/endoplasmic calcium ATPase (SERCA2) mRNA and protein, which results in lower calcium levels in the endoplasmic reticulum compared to the control, untreated group. The dbcAMP revealed rapid increase in expression of the type 3 IP3 receptor, which participates in a calcium clearance from the endoplasmic reticulum. These results point to the important role of reticular calcium in a NG108-15 cell differentiation.

AB  - Abstract
Previous studies have shown the prominence of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide in rewarding and reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse specially psychostimulants. The data regarding the effects of different stages of opioid addiction on CART expression and the interconnection between CART and opioids are not much available. Here we have studied the changes in the expression level of CART mRNA and protein in various parts of the brain reward pathway in different stages of opioid addiction. Groups of male rats received acute low-dose (10 mg/kg), acute high-dose (80 mg/kg) and chronic escalating doses of morphine. In addition, withdrawal and abstinence states were evaluated after injection of naloxone (1 mg/kg) and long-term maintenance of addicted animals, respectively. Expression of CART mRNA in the brain was measured by real-time PCR method. Western blotting was used to quantify the protein level. CART mRNA and protein were both up-regulated in high-dose morphine-administered animals and also in the withdrawal group in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), striatum and prefrontal cortex (PFC). In the addicted group, CART mRNA and protein were both down-regulated in NAc and striatum. In the abstinent group, CART mRNA was down-regulated in NAc. In the hippocampus, the only observed change was the up-regulation of CART mRNA in the withdrawal group. We suggest that the modulatory role of CART peptide in rewarding and reinforcing effects of opioids weakens when opioids are used for a long time and is stimulated when acute stress such as naloxone-induced withdrawal syndrome or acute high-dose administration of morphine occurs to the animal.

AB  - Abstract
DTNBP1, which encodes dysbindin-1, is associated with cognitive impairment. Genetic evidence indicates that the C allele of rs117610176 leads to an increase in DTNBP-1b mRNA splicing in patients with paranoid schizophrenia. In addition, dysbindin-1B, rather than dysbindin-1A/C, exhibits a tendency toward toxic aggregation. In postmortem brains, dysbindin-1B not only aggregates with itself, it also co-aggregates with proteins that interact with it. However, the pathogenic mechanism underlying dysbindin-1B toxic aggregation remains unknown. In the brain, dysbindin-1 is primarily found as a subunit of biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex 1 (BLOC-1), which plays a role in intracellular vesicle trafficking. Therefore, we hypothesized that dysbindin-1B might impair the cognitive function of schizophrenia patients by co-aggregating with BLOC-1 subunits and disturbing the function of BLOC-1. In this study, we investigated the dominant-negative effect of dysbindin-1B on the BLOC-1 complex. We found that in multiple brain areas in Dys1B+/+ mice, the expression levels of soluble functional BLOC-1 subunits were decreased. Meanwhile, BLOC-1 subunits co-aggregated with dysbindin-1B-myc. Functional studies in primary cortical neurons further revealed the malfunction of BLOC-1 in intercellular vesicle trafficking in Dys1B+/+ mice. In addition, we used the Morris water maze task to investigate the effects of dysbindin-1B aggregation on cognition. The results demonstrated that Dys1B+/+ mice exhibited spatial learning and memory deficits, which were accompanied by the shrinkage of apical and basal dendritic branches and the loss of dendritic spines in hippocampal CA1 neurons, as demonstrated by Golgi staining. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that dysbindin-1B toxic aggregation might impair cognition through a dominant-negative effect on BLOC-1.

AB  - Abstract
Characterizing how the brain appraises the psychological dimensions of reward is one of the central topics of neuroscience. It has become clear that dopamine neurons are implicated in the transmission of both rewarding information and aversive and alerting events through two different neuronal populations involved in encoding the motivational value and the motivational salience of stimuli, respectively. Nonetheless, there is less agreement on the role of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the related neurotransmitter release during the processing of biologically relevant stimuli. To address this issue, we employed magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a non-invasive methodology that allows detection of some metabolites in the human brain in vivo, in order to assess the role of the vmPFC in encoding stimulus value rather than stimulus salience. Specifically, we measured gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and, with control purposes, Glx levels in healthy subjects during the observation of appetitive and disgusting food images. We observed a decrease of GABA and no changes in Glx concentration in the vmPFC in both conditions. Furthermore, a comparatively smaller GABA reduction during the observation of appetitive food images than during the observation of disgusting food images was positively correlated with the scores obtained to the body image concerns sub-scale of Body Uneasiness Test (BUT). These results are consistent with the idea that the vmPFC plays a crucial role in processing both rewarding and aversive stimuli, possibly by encoding stimulus salience through glutamatergic and/or noradrenergic projections to deeper mesencephalic and limbic areas.

AB  - Abstract
Paclitaxel is a first-line chemotherapeutic with the major dose-limiting side effect of painful neuropathy. Previous preclinical studies indicate mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are associated with this disorder; however no direct assessment of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and antioxidant enzyme activity in sensory neurons following paclitaxel has been undertaken. As expected, repeated low doses of systemic paclitaxel in rats induced long-lasting pain behaviour with a delayed onset, akin to the clinical scenario. To elucidate the role of ROS in the development and maintenance of paclitaxel-induced painful neuropathy, we have assessed ROS and antioxidant enzyme activity levels in the nociceptive system in vivo at three key behavioural time-points; prior to pain onset (day 7), peak pain severity and pain resolution. In isolated dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, ROS levels were unchanged following paclitaxel-exposure in vitro or in vivo. ROS levels were further assessed in DRG and spinal cord in vivo following intrathecal MitoTracker®RedCM-H2XRos administration in paclitaxel-/vehicle-treated rats. ROS levels were increased at day 7, specifically in non-peptidergic DRG neurons. In the spinal cord, neuronally-derived ROS was increased at day 7, yet ROS levels in microglia and astrocytes were unaltered. In DRG, CuZnSOD and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity were increased at day 7 and peak pain time-points, respectively. In peripheral sensory nerves, CuZnSOD activity was increased at day 7, and at peak pain, MnSOD, CuZnSOD and GPx activity were increased. Catalase activity was unaltered in DRG and saphenous nerves. These data suggest that neuronally-derived mitochondrial ROS, accompanied with an inadequate endogenous antioxidant enzyme response, are contributory factors in paclitaxel-induced painful neuropathy.

AB  - Abstract
The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) plays an important role in integrating and relaying input information to other brain regions in response to stress. The cytoarchitecture of the BST in tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) has been comprehensively described in our previous publications. However, the inputs to the BST have not been described in previous reports. The aim of the present study was to investigate the sources of afferent projections to the BST throughout the brain of tree shrews using the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold (FG). The present results provide the first detailed whole-brain mapping of BST-projecting neurons in the tree shrew brain. The BST was densely innervated by the prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, ventral subiculum, amygdala, ventral tegmental area, and parabrachial nucleus. Moreover, moderate projections to the BST originated from the medial preoptic area, supramammillary nucleus, paraventricular thalamic nucleus, pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, locus coeruleus, and nucleus of the solitary tract. Afferent projections to the BST are identified in the ventral pallidum, nucleus of the diagonal band, ventral posteromedial thalamic nucleus, posterior complex of the thalamus, interfascicular nucleus, retrorubral field, rhabdoid nucleus, intermediate reticular nucleus, and parvicellular reticular nucleus. In addition, the different densities of BST-projecting neurons in various regions were analyzed in the tree shrew brains. In summary, whole-brain mapping of direct inputs to the BST is delineated in tree shrews. These brain circuits are implicated in the regulation of numerous physiological and behavioral processes including stress, reward, food intake, and arousal.

AB  - Abstract
Small molecular G-protein plays a key role in several diseases. This study was designed to reveal the role of RhoA signaling in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain in mice. Partial sciatic nerve injury caused thermal hyperalgesia, mechanical allodynia, and increased plasma membrane translocation of RhoA in the lumber spinal cord. GFAP-immunoreactivity (ir), Iba-1-ir, and Rho kinase 2 (ROCK2-ir) was also increased in the ipsilateral spinal dorsal horn of nerve-ligated mice. Moreover, partial nerve ligation increased the expression of phosphorylated myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS)-ir in the ipsilateral spinal dorsal horn. Daily intrathecal administration of simvastatin, beginning 3 days before nerve injury, completely blocked all these changes in nerve-ligated mice. Pharmacological inhibition of ROCK also attenuated the increased expression of GFAP-ir and phosphorylated MARCKS-ir. Together, it is suggested that astrogliosis initiated by the activation of RhoA/ROCK signaling results in MARCKS phosphorylation in nerve terminals, which leads to hyperalgesia in neuropathic pain. Furthermore, simvastatin exerts antihyperalgesic and antiallodynic effects through the inhibition of spinal RhoA activation.

AB  - Abstract
Recent optogenetic studies demonstrated that phasic dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens may play a causal role in multiple aspects of natural and drug reward-related behaviors. The role of tonic dopamine release in reward consummatory behavior remains unclear. The current study used a combinatorial viral-mediated gene delivery approach to express ChR2 on mesolimbic dopamine neurons in rats. We used optical activation of this dopamine circuit to mimic tonic dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens and to explore the causal relationship between this form of dopamine signaling within the ventral tegmental area (VTA)-nucleus accumbens projection and consumption of a natural reward. Using a two bottle choice paradigm (sucrose vs. water), the experiments revealed that tonic optogenetic stimulation of mesolimbic dopamine transmission significantly decreased reward consummatory behaviors. Specifically, there was a significant decrease in the number of bouts, licks and amount of sucrose obtained during the drinking session. Notably, activation of VTA dopamine cell bodies or dopamine terminals in the nucleus accumbens resulted in identical behavioral consequences. No changes in water intake were evident under the same experimental conditions. Collectively, these data demonstrate that tonic optogenetic stimulation of VTA-nucleus accumbens dopamine release is sufficient to inhibit reward consummatory behavior, possibly by preventing this circuit from engaging in phasic activity that is thought to be essential for reward-based behaviors.

AB  - Abstract
Endocannabinoids acting on cannabinoid-1 receptors (CB1Rs) are proposed to protect brain and spinal neurons from excitotoxic damage. The ability to recover from spinal cord injury (SCI), in which excitotoxicity is a major player, is usually investigated at late times after modulation of CB1Rs whose role in the early phases of SCI remains unclear. Using the rat spinal cord in vitro as a model for studying SCI initial pathophysiology, we investigated if agonists or antagonists of CB1Rs might affect SCI induced by the excitotoxic agent kainate (KA) within 24 h from a transient (1 h) application of this glutamate agonist. The CB1 agonist anandamide (AEA or pharmacological block of its degradation) did not limit excitotoxic depolarization of spinal networks: cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) assay demonstrated that CB1Rs remained functional 24 h later and similarly expressed among dead or survived cells. Locomotor-like network activity recorded from ventral roots could not recover with such treatments and was associated with persistent depression of synaptic transmission. Motoneurons, that are particularly vulnerable to KA, were not protected by AEA. Application of 2-arachidonoylglycerol also did not attenuate the electrophysiological and histological damage. The intensification of damage by the CB1 antagonist AM251 suggested that endocannabinoids were operative after excitotoxic stimulation, yet insufficient to contrast it efficiently. The present data indicate that the early phases of excitotoxic SCI could not be arrested by pharmacologically exploiting the endocannabinoid system, consistent with the notion that AEA and its derivatives are more useful to treat late SCI phases.

AB  - Abstract
Human Dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of molecular weight 32 kDa (DARPP-32, also known as PPP1R1B) gene codes for different transcripts that are mainly translated into two DARPP-32 protein isoforms, full length (fl)-DARPP-32 and truncated (t)-DARPP. The t-DARPP lacks the first 36 residues at the N-terminal, which alters its function. In the central nervous system, fl-DARPP-32 is highly expressed in GABAergic striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), where it integrates dopaminergic and glutamatergic input signaling. However, no information about human DARPP-32 isoform expression during MSNs maturation is available. In this study, our aim is to determine the expression of the two DARPP-32 isoforms in human fetal and adult striatal samples. We show that DARPP-32 isoform expression is differentially regulated during human striatal development, with the t-DARPP isoform being virtually absent from whole ganglionic eminence (WGE) and highly induced in the adult striatum (in both caudate and putamen). We next compared the four most common anti-DARPP-32 antibodies used in human specimens, to study their recognition of the two isoforms in fetal and adult human striatal samples by western blot and immunohistochemistry. The four antibodies specifically identify the fl-DARPP-32 in both fetal and adult samples, while t-DARPP form was only detected in adult striatal samples. In addition, the lack of t-DARPP recognition in human adult striatum by the antibody generated against the full-length domain produces in turn different efficacy by immunohistochemical analysis. In conclusion, our results show that expression of human DARPP-32 protein isoforms depends on the striatal neurodevelopmental stage with t-DARPP being specific for the human adult striatum.

AB  - Abstract
Somatosensory information from the limbs reaches the contralateral Primary Sensory Cortex (S1) with a delay of 23 ms for finger, and 40 ms for leg (somatosensory N20/N40). Upon arrival of this input in the cortex, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) are momentarily inhibited. This phenomenon is called ‘short latency afferent inhibition (SAI)’ and can be used as a tool for investigating sensorimotor interactions in the brain. We used SAI to investigate the process of sensorimotor integration in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the stimulated limb. We hypothesized that ipsilateral SAI would occur with a delay following the onset of contralateral SAI, to allow for transcallosal conduction of the signal. We electrically stimulated the limb either contralateral or ipsilateral to the hemisphere receiving TMS, using a range of different interstimulus intervals (ISI). We tested the First Dorsal Interosseous (FDI) muscle in the hand, and Tibialis Anterior (TA) in the lower leg, in three separate experiments. Ipsilateral SAI was elicited in the upper limb (FDI) at all ISIs that were greater than N20+18 ms (all p &lt; .05) but never at any earlier timepoint. No ipsilateral SAI was detected in the lower limb (TA) at any of the tested ISIs. The delayed onset timing of ipsilateral SAI suggests that transcallosal communication mediates this inhibitory process for the upper limb. The complete absence of ipsilateral SAI in the lower limb warrants consideration of the potential limb-specific differences in demands for bilateral sensorimotor integration.

AB  - Abstract
Cognitive disability is an unavoidable feature of Down syndrome (DS), a genetic disorder due to the triplication of human chromosome 21. DS is associated with alterations of neurogenesis, neuron maturation and connectivity that are already present at prenatal life stages. Recent evidence shows that pharmacotherapies can have a large impact on the trisomic brain provided that they are administered perinatally. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major polyphenol of green tea, performs many actions in the brain, including inhibition of DYRK1A, a kinase that is over-expressed in the DS brain and contributes to the DS phenotype. Young adults with DS treated with EGCG exhibit some cognitive benefits, although these effects disappear with time. We deemed it extremely important, however, to establish whether treatment with EGCG at the initial stages of brain development leads to plastic changes that outlast treatment cessation. In the current study, we exploited the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS in order to establish whether pharmacotherapy with EGCG during peak of neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) enduringly restores hippocampal development and memory performance. Euploid and Ts65Dn mice were treated with EGCG from postnatal day 3 (P3) to P15. The effects of treatment were examined at its cessation (at P15) or after one month (at P45). We found that at P15 treated trisomic pups exhibited restoration of neurogenesis, total hippocampal granule cell number and levels of pre- and postsynaptic proteins in the DG, hippocampus and neocortex. However, at P45 none of these effects were still present, nor did treated Ts65Dn mice exhibit any improvement in hippocampus-dependent tasks. These findings show that treatment with EGCG carried out in the neonatal period rescues numerous trisomy-linked brain alterations. However, even during this, the most critical time window for hippocampal development, EGCG does not elicit enduring effects on the hippocampal physiology.

AB  - Abstract
The aim of the present work was to characterize neurons in the archi- and neocortical white matter, and to investigate their distribution in mesial temporal sclerosis. Immunohistochemistry and quantification of neurons were performed on surgically resected tissue sections of patients with therapy-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. Temporal lobe tissues of patients with tumor but without epilepsy and that from autopsy were used as controls. Neurons were identified with immunohistochemistry using antibodies against NeuN, calcium-binding proteins, transcription factor Tbr1 and neurofilaments. We found significantly higher density of neurons in the archi- and neocortical white matter of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy than in that of controls. Based on their morphology and neurochemical content, both excitatory and inhibitory cells were present among these neurons. A subset of neurons in the white matter was Tbr-1-immunoreactive and these neurons coexpressed NeuN and neurofilament marker SMI311R. No colocalization of Tbr1 was observed with the inhibitory neuronal markers, calcium-binding proteins. We suggest that a large population of white matter neurons comprises remnants of the subplate. Furthermore, we propose that a subset of white matter neurons was arrested during migration, highlighting the role of cortical maldevelopment in epilepsy associated with mesial temporal sclerosis.

AB  - Abstract
Oxidative stress plays a critical role in various neurodegenerative diseases, thus alleviating oxidative stress is a potential strategy for therapeutic intervention and/or prevention of neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, alleviation of oxidative stress through curcumin is investigated in A172 (human glioblastoma cell line) and HA-sp (human astrocytes cell line derived from the spinal cord) astrocytes. H2O2 was used to induce oxidative stress in astrocytes (A172 and HA-sp). Data show that H2O2 induces activation of astrocytes in dose- and time-dependent manner as evident by increased expression of GFAP in A172 and HA-sp cells after 24 and 12 h respectively. An upregulation of Prdx6 was also observed in A172 and HA-sp cells after 24 h of H2O2 treatment as compared to untreated control. Our data also showed that curcumin inhibits oxidative stress-induced cytoskeleton disarrangement, and impedes the activation of astrocytes by inhibiting upregulation of GFAP, vimentin and Prdx6. In addition, we observed an inhibition of oxidative stress-induced inflammation, apoptosis and mitochondria fragmentation after curcumin treatment. Therefore, our results suggest that curcumin not only protects astrocytes from H2O2-induced oxidative stress but also reverses the mitochondrial damage and dysfunction induced by oxidative stress. This study also provides evidence for protective role of curcumin on astrocytes by showing its effects on attenuating reactive astrogliosis and inhibiting apoptosis.

AB  - Abstract
Membrane potential shift driven by electrical activity is critical in determining the cell fate of proliferation or differentiation. As such, the ion channels that underlie the membrane electrical activity play an important role in cell proliferation/differentiation. KV7/KCNQ potassium channels are critical in determining the resting membrane potentials in many neuronal cells. However, the role of these channels in cell differentiation is not well studied. In the present study, we used PC12 cells as well as primary cultured rat cortical neurons to study the role and mechanism of KV7/KCNQ in neuronal differentiation. NGF induced PC12 cell differentiation into neuron-like cells with growth of neurites showing typical growth cone-like extensions. The Kv7/KCNQ blocker XE991 promoted NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, whereas Kv7/KCNQ opener retigabine (RTG) inhibited outgrowth. M-type Kv7 channels are likely involved in regulating neurite growth because overexpression of KCNQ2/Q3 inhibited neurite growth whereas suppression of KCNQ2/Q3 with shRNA promoted neurite growth. Membrane depolarization possibly underpins enhanced neurite growth induced by the suppression of Kv7/KCNQ. Additionally, high extracellular K+ likely induced membrane depolarization and also promoted neurite growth. Finally, T-type Ca2+ channels may be involved in membrane-depolarization-induced neurite growth. This study provides a new perspective for understanding neuronal differentiation as well as KV7/KCNQ channel function.

AB  - Abstract
Recanalization of occluded vessels leads to ischemia–reperfusion injury (IRI), with oxidative stress as one of the main causes of injury, despite the fact that recanalization therapy is the most effective treatment for ischemic stroke. The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is one of the transcription factors which has an essential role in protection against oxidative stress. RS9 is a novel Nrf2 activator obtained from bardoxolone methyl (BARD), an Nrf2 activator that has already been tested in a clinical trial, using a biotransformation technique. RS9 has been reported to lead to higher Nrf2 activation and less cytotoxicity than BARD. In this study, we investigated the effects of RS9 on IRI. Mice were intraperitoneally treated immediately after 2 h of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with a vehicle solution or 0.2 mg/kg of RS9. Post-onset treatment of RS9 attenuated the infarct volume and improved neurological deficits 22 h after reperfusion. RS9 activated Nrf2 2 and 6 h after reperfusion and activated heme oxygenase-1 at 6 and 22 h after reperfusion. RS9 also attenuated the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 2 and 6 h after reperfusion. Finally, RS9 improved the survival rate and neurological deficits 7 days after MCAO. Our results suggest that the activation of Nrf2 by RS9 has a neuroprotective effect, mediated by attenuating both oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, and that RS9 is an effective therapeutic candidate for the treatment of IRI.

AB  - Abstract
Diazoxide, a well-known mitochondrial KATP channel opener with neuroprotective effects, has been proposed for the effective and safe treatment of neuroinflammation. To test whether diazoxide affects the neurogenesis associated with excitotoxicity in brain injury, we induced lesions by injecting excitotoxic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) into the rat hippocampus and analyzed the effects of a daily oral administration of diazoxide on the induced lesion. Specific glial and neuronal staining showed that NMDA elicited a strong glial reaction associated with progressive neuronal loss in the whole hippocampal formation. Doublecortin immunohistochemistry and bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-NeuN double immunohistochemistry revealed that NMDA also induced cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the lesioned non-neurogenic hippocampus. Furthermore, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells in the injured hippocampus expressed transcription factor Sp8 indicating that the excitotoxic lesion elicited the migration of progenitors from the subventricular zone and/or the reprograming of reactive astrocytes. Diazoxide treatment attenuated the NMDA-induced hippocampal injury in rats, as demonstrated by decreases in the size of the lesion, neuronal loss and microglial reaction. Diazoxide also increased the number of BrdU/NeuN double-stained cells and elevated the number of Sp8-positive cells in the lesioned hippocampus. These results indicate a role for KATP channel activation in regulating excitotoxicity-induced neurogenesis in brain injury.

AB  - Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that accompanied by memory deficits and neuropsychiatric dysfunction. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have seemly therapeutic potential in AD, but the benefit of n-3 PUFAs is still in debates. Here, we employed a transgenic mice carry fat-1 gene to encode n-3 desaturase from Caenorhabditis elegans, which increase endogenous n-3 PUFAs by converting n-6 PUFAs to n-3 PUFAs crossed with amyloid precursor protein (APP) Tg mice to evaluate the protective effects of endogenous n-3 PUFAs on cognitive and behavioral deficits of APP Tg mice. We fed APP, APP/fat-1 and fat-1 mice with n-6 PUFAs rich diet. Brain tissues were collected at 3, 9 and 12 months for fatty acid and gene expression analysis, histology and protein assays. Morris Water Maze Test, open field test and elevated plus maze test were performed to measure the behavior capability. From the results, the expression of fat-1 transgene increased cortical n-3: n-6 PUFAs ratio and n-3 PUFAs concentrations, and sensorimotor dysfunction and cognitive deficits in AD were significantly less severe in APP/fat-1 mice with endogenous n-3 PUFAs than in APP mice controls. The protection against disturbance of spontaneous motor activity and cognitive deficits in AD was strongly correlated with increased n-3: n-6 PUFAs ratio and endogenous n-3 PUFAs, reduced APP generation, inhibited amyloid β peptide aggregation, suppressed nuclear factor-kappa B and astroglia activation, and reduced death of neurons in the cortex of APP/fat-1 mice compared with APP mice controls. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that an available medication with the maintenance of enriched n-3 PUFAs in the brain could slow down cognitive decline and prevent neuropsychological disorder in AD.

AB  - Abstract
Vitamin D regulates multiple factors including those involved in the ontogeny of dopaminergic systems. It has been shown that in neonatal rats maternally deprived of vitamin D, dopamine (DA) turnover is decreased with associated reductions in one catabolic enzyme, catechol-o-methyl transferase (COMT). To directly examine this signaling relationship, in the present study we have over-expressed the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells in order to examine the mechanisms by which the active vitamin D hormone, 1,25(OH)2D3, via its receptor VDR, affects DA production and turnover. Our results show that VDR overexpression increases DA neuron differentiation by increasing tyrosine hydroxylase expression, DA production and decreasing the expression of NEUROG2 a marker of immature DA neurons. In the VDR-overexpressing cells, 1,25(OH)2D3 further increased the levels of the DA-metabolites 3-MT and HVA and elevated COMT gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed that 1,25(OH)2D3 increased VDR binding in three regions of the COMT promoter, strongly suggesting direct regulation. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment attenuated increased levels of MAOA, DRD2 and VMAT2 gene expression caused by the VDR-overexpression. Taken together, these results show VDR and 1,25(OH)2D3 are directly involved in regulating the expression of dopaminergic-associated genes and that this in vitro neuronal model is a useful tool for identifying the role of 1,25(OH)2D3 in DA neuronal development and maturation.

AB  - Abstract
Metastasis suppressor 1 (MTSS1) or missing in metastasis (MIM) is an actin- and membrane-binding protein with tumor suppressor functions. MTSS1 is important for cell morphology, motility, metastasis. The role of MTSS1 in cell morphology has been widely investigated in non-neuronal tissues; however the role of MTSS1 in neurite outgrowth remains unclear. Here we investigated the effect of MTSS1 on neurite outgrowth in primary cerebellar granule and hippocampal neurons of mouse. We found that overexpression of MTSS1 in cerebellar granule neurons significantly enhanced dendrite elaboration but inhibited axon elongation. This phenotype was significantly reduced by deletion of the Wiskott–Aldrich homology 2 (WH2) motif and point mutation in the insulin receptor substrate p53 (IRSp53) and MIM/MTSS1 homology (IMD) domain. Furthermore, inhibition of Rac1 activity or blocking of phosphatidyl inositol phosphates (PIPs) signaling decreased the effect of MTSS1 markedly. In accordance with the over-expression data, knockdown of MTSS1 in cerebellar granule neurons could increase the axon length but decrease the dendrite length and the number of dendrites. In addition, MTSS1 knock down in embryonic hippocampal neurons suppressed neurite branching and reduced dendrite length. Our findings have demonstrated that MTSS1 modulates neuronal morphology, possibly through a Rac1–PIPs signaling pathway.

AB  - Abstract
Generation of new neurons from adult neural stem cells occurs in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus and the lateral walls of the lateral ventricles. In this article, we study the neurogenesis that takes place during the hibernation of the Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus). Using a variety of standard neurogenesis markers and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, we describe a preferential decrease in the proliferation of newborn neurons in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the hibernating hamsters (torpor) rather than in the hippocampus. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proliferative capacity is recovered after 3–4 days of torpor when arousal is triggered under natural conditions (i.e., not artificially provoked). In addition, we show that tau3R, a tau isoform with three microtubule-binding domains, is a suitable marker to study neurogenesis both in the SVZ and subgranular zone (SGZ) of the Syrian hamster brain.

AB  - Abstract
In the last decades it has been shown that two components of the event-related potentials (ERPs), the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the P300, reflect the evaluation of the outcomes of a given course of action. Within the reinforcement learning theory, the prevailing interpretation of the relationship between FRN and P300 is the classical “independent coding model”. This model proposes that the FRN is only sensitive to feedback valence whereas the P300 is only sensitive to feedback magnitude. However, these predictions have recently been challenged and the question remains unsolved. The goal of the present study is to shed light on the effects of outcome valence and magnitude on the FRN and the feedback-P300. The electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded while participants performed a perceptual discrimination task with two levels of difficulty, in which they could receive large or small rewards and penalties. We used receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses, which allowed us to analyze the relationship between the outcomes and EEG on a trial-by-trial basis. The results reveal that both components, which are contingent on feedback presentation, are sensitive to outcome valence. Regarding magnitude, this only affects the feedback P300, and only in conjunction with difficulty. Finally, we found that task difficulty has the opposite effect on these components, both in their latencies and discriminability. Our results suggest that the FRN and the feedback-P300 in fact reflect different performance monitoring processes in a flexible way that depends on the behavioral context.

AB  - Abstract
Knowledge of the properties that govern the effectiveness of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) interventions is critical to clinical application. Extrapolation to clinical populations has been limited by high inter-subject variability and a focus on intrinsic muscles of the hand in healthy populations. Therefore, the current study assessed variability of continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a patterned TMS protocol, across an agonist–antagonist pair of extrinsic muscles of the hand. Secondarily, we assessed whether concurrent agonist contraction could enhance the efficacy of cTBS. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) were simultaneously recorded from the agonist flexor (FCR) and antagonist extensor (ECR) carpi radialis before and after cTBS over the FCR hotspot. cTBS was delivered with the FCR relaxed (cTBS-Relax) or during isometric wrist flexion (cTBS-Contract). cTBS-Relax suppressed FCR MEPs evoked from the FCR hotspot. However, the extent of FCR MEP suppression was strongly correlated with the relative difference between FCR and ECR resting motor thresholds. cTBS-Contract decreased FCR suppression but increased suppression of ECR MEPs elicited from the FCR hotspot. The magnitude of ECR MEP suppression following cTBS-Contract was independent of the threshold-amplitude relationships observed with cTBS-Relax. Contraction alone had no effect confirming the effect of cTBS-Contract was driven by the interaction between neuromuscular activity and cTBS. Interactions across muscle representations should be taken into account when predicting cTBS outcomes in healthy and clinical populations. Contraction during cTBS may be a useful means of focusing aftereffects when differences in baseline excitability across overlapping agonist–antagonist cortical representations may mitigate the inhibitory effect of cTBS.

Increased pain perception due to the expectation to feel more pain is called nocebo effect. The present study aimed at investigating whether: (1) the mere expectation to feel more pain after the administration of an inert drug can affect the laser-pain rating and the laser-evoked potential (LEP) amplitude, and (2) the learning potentiates the nocebo effect. Eighteen healthy volunteers were told that an inert cream, applied on the right hand, would increase the laser pain and LEP amplitude to right hand stimulation. They were randomly assigned to either “verbal session” or “conditioning session”. In the “verbal session”, LEPs to both right and left hand stimulation were recorded at the same intensity before (baseline) and after cream application. In the “conditioning session”, after an initial cream application the laser stimulus intensity was increased surreptitiously to make the subjects believe that the treatment really increased the pain sensation. Then, the cream was reapplied, and LEPs were recorded at the same stimulus intensity as at the baseline. It was found that the verbal suggestion to feel more pain disrupted the physiological habituation of the laser-pain rating and LEP amplitude to treated (right) hand stimulation. Unlike previously demonstrated for the placebo effect, the learning did not potentiate the nocebo effect.

AB  - Abstract
The p21-activated kinases (PAKs) of group I are the main effectors for the small Rho GTPases, critically involved in neurodevelopment, plasticity and maturation of the nervous system. Moreover, the neuronal complexity controlled by PAK1/PAK3 signaling determines the postnatal brain size and synaptic properties. Stress induces alterations at the level of structural and functional synaptic plasticity accompanied by reductions in size and activity of the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex (PFC). These abnormalities are likely to contribute to the pathology of depression and, in part, reflect impaired cytoskeleton remodeling pointing to the role of Rho GTPase signaling. Thus, the present study assessed the expression of the group I PAKs and their activators in the brain of depressed subjects. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), mRNA levels and coexpression of the group I PAKs: PAK1, PAK2, and PAK3 as well as of their activators: RAC1, CDC42 and ARHGEF7 were examined in postmortem samples from the PFC (n = 25) and the hippocampus (n = 23) of subjects with depression and compared to control subjects (PFC n = 24; hippocampus n = 21). Results demonstrated that mRNA levels of PAK1 and PAK3, are significantly reduced in the brain of depressed subjects, with PAK1 being reduced in the PFC and PAK3 in the hippocampus. No differences were observed for the ubiquitously expressed PAK2. Following analysis of gene coexpression demonstrated disruption of coordinated gene expression in the brain of subjects with depression. Abnormalities in mRNA expression of PAK1 and PAK3 as well as their altered coexpression patterns were detected in the brain of subjects with depression.

AB  - Abstract
Growing evidence suggests Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) often co-occurs with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and a better understanding of the nature of their overlap, including at a neurobiological level, is needed. Research has implicated cerebellar-networks as part of the neural-circuitry disrupted in ASD, but little research has been carried out to investigate this in ADHD. We investigated cerebellar integrity using a double-step saccade adaptation paradigm in a group of male children age 8–15 (n = 12) diagnosed with ADHD-Combined Type (-CT). Their performance was compared to a group of age and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) controls (n = 12). Parent reported symptoms of ADHD-CT and ASD were measured, along with motor proficiency (Movement ABC-2). We found, on average, the adaptation of saccade gain was reduced for the ADHD-CT group compared to the TD group. Greater saccadic gain change (adaptation) was also positively correlated with higher Movement ABC-2 total and balance scores among the ADHD-CT participants. These differences suggest cerebellar networks underlying saccade adaptation may be disrupted in young people with ADHD-CT. Though our findings require further replication with larger samples, they suggest further research into cerebellar dysfunction in ADHD-CT, and as a point of neurobiological overlap with ASD, may be warranted.

AB  - Abstract
Injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) leads to the loss of ipsilateral laryngeal fold movement, with dysphonia, and occasionally dysphagia. Functional movement of the vocal folds is never restored due to misrouting of regenerating axons to agonist and antagonist laryngeal muscles. Changes of neurotrophic factor expression within denervated muscles occur after nerve injury and may influence nerve regeneration, axon guidance and muscle reinnervation. This study investigates the expression of certain neurotrophic factors in the laryngeal muscles during the course of axonal regeneration using RT-PCR. The timing of neurotrophic factor expression was correlated to the reinnervation of the laryngeal muscles by motor axons. Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and Netrin-1 (NTN-1) increased their expression levels in laryngeal muscles after nerve section and during regeneration of RLN. The upregulation of trophic factors returned to control levels following regeneration of RLN. The expression levels of the neurotrophic factors were correlated with the innervation of regenerating axons into the denervated muscles. The results suggest that certain neurotrophic factor expression is strongly correlated to the reinnervation pattern of the regenerating RLN. These factors may be involved in guidance and neuromuscular junction formation during nerve regeneration. In the future, their manipulation may enhance the selective reinnervation of the larynx.

AB  - Abstract
Locomotion recovery after a spinal cord injury (SCI) includes axon regeneration, myelin preservation and increased plasticity in propriospinal and descending spinal circuitries. The combined effects of tamoxifen and exercise after a SCI were analyzed in this study to determine whether the combination of both treatments induces the best outcome in locomotion recovery. In this study, the penetrating injury was provoked by a sharp projectile that penetrates through right dorsal and ventral portions of the T13-L1 spinal segments, affecting propriospinal and descending/ascending tracts. Intraperitoneal application of Tamoxifen and a treadmill exercise protocol, as rehabilitation therapies, separately or combined, were used. To evaluate the functional recovery, angular patterns of the hip, knee and ankle joints as well as the leg pendulum-like movement (PLM) were measured during the unrestricted gait of treated and untreated (UT) animals, previously and after the traumatic injury (15 and 30 days post-injury (dpi)). A pattern (curve) comparison analysis was made by using a locally designed Matlab script that determines the Frechet dissimilarity. The SCI magnitude was assessed by qualitative and quantitative histological analysis of the injury site 30 days after SCI. Our results showed that all treated groups had an improvement in hindlimbs kinematics compared to the UT group, which showed a poor gait locomotion recovery throughout the rehabilitation period. The group with the combined treatment (tamoxifen + exercise (TE)) presented the best outcome. In conclusion, tamoxifen and treadmill exercise treatments are complementary therapies for the functional recovery of gait locomotion in hemi-spinalized rats.

AB  - Abstract
Rewarding social behaviors including positive social interactions and sexual behaviors are shown to regulate adult neurogenesis, but the underlying biological mechanisms remain elusive. Oxytocin, a neurohypophysial hormone secreted after exposure to social interaction or sexual behaviors, has a profound role in the formation of social bonding and regulation of emotional distress. While the acute effect of oxytocin was usually studied, relatively scarce evidence showed the behavioral consequence of repeated oxytocin treatment. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effect of repeated oxytocin treatment on hippocampal cell proliferation, dendritic maturation of new born neurons and social/emotional behaviors. Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats received treatment with either vehicle or oxytocin (1 mg/kg) daily for two weeks. Behavioral tests revealed that oxytocin increased social behaviors and reduced the anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Cell proliferation, differentiation and the dendritic complexity of new born neurons in the hippocampus were promoted by oxytocin treatment. Depression- and anxiety-like behaviors were induced by repeated treatment of corticosterone (40 mg/kg) for two weeks while oxytocin treatment reversed the behavioral disturbances. Suppression of cell proliferation caused by corticosterone was reverted by oxytocin treatment in which cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and dendritic complexity increased. The present findings reveal that oxytocin not only enhances cell proliferation, but also promotes the development of the new neurons which is associated with the induction of positive emotional and social behaviors. The results also suggest that oxytocin may be a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of emotional and social dysfunction.

AB  - Abstract
Females are more likely to experience visceral pain than males, yet mechanisms underlying this sex bias are not fully elucidated. Moreover, pain sensitivity can change throughout the menstrual cycle. Alterations in the glutamatergic system have been implicated in several pain-disorders; however, whether these are sex-dependent is unclear. Thus, we aimed to investigate sex differences in the spinal cord glutamate uptake and how it varies across the estrous cycle. The activity of the glutamate transporters, excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) was assessed using an ex vivo aspartate radioactive uptake assay in the lumbosacral spinal cord in Sprague–Dawley male and female rats. The gene expression of EAATs, glutamate receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B and the estrogen receptors ERα &amp; ERβ in the spinal cord were also analyzed. EAAT activity was lower in females, particularly during the estrus phase, and this was the only cycle stage that was responsive to the pharmacological effects of the EAATs activator riluzole. Interestingly, EAAT1 mRNA expression was lower in high-estrogen and high-ERα states compared to diestrus in females. We conclude that the Spinal EAAT activity in females is different to that in males, and varies across the estrous cycle. Furthermore, the expression levels of estrogen receptors also showed a cycle-dependent pattern that may affect EAATs function and expression.

AB  - Abstract
We examined whether aging with and without a cerebral lesion such as stroke affects modulation of reactive balance response for recovery from increasing intensity of sudden slip-like stance perturbations. Ten young adults, older age-match adults and older chronic stroke survivors were exposed to three different levels of slip-like perturbations, level 1 (7.75 m/s2), Level II (12.00 m/s2) and level III (16.75 m/s2) in stance. The center of mass (COM) state stability was computed as the shortest distance of the instantaneous COM position and velocity relative to base of support (BOS) from a theoretical threshold for backward loss of balance (BLOB). The COM position ( X COM / BOS ) and velocity ( X ̇ COM / BOS ) relative to BOS at compensatory step touchdown, compensatory step length and trunk angle at touchdown were also recorded. At liftoff, stability reduced with increasing perturbation intensity across all groups (main effect of intensity p &lt; 0.05). At touchdown, while the young group showed a linear improvement in stability with increasing perturbation intensity, such a trend was absent in other groups (intensity × group interaction, p &lt; 0.05). Between-group differences in stability at touchdown were thus observed at levels II and III. Further, greater stability at touchdown positively correlated with anterior X COM / BOS however not with X ̇ COM / BOS . Young adults maintained anterior X COM / BOS by increasing compensatory step length and preventing greater trunk extension at higher perturbation intensities. The age-match group attempted to increase step length from intensity I to II to maintain stability however could not further increase step length at intensity III, resulting in lower stability on this level compared with the young group. Stroke group on the other hand was unable to modulate compensatory step length or control trunk extension at higher perturbation intensities resulting in reduced stability on levels II and III compared with the other groups. The findings reflect impaired modulation of recovery response with increasing intensity of sudden perturbations among stroke survivors compared with their healthy counter parts. Thus, aging superimposed with a cortical lesion could further impair reactive balance control, potentially contributing toward a higher fall risk in older stroke survivors.

AB  - Abstract
The mammalian brain has evolved in close synchrony with the natural environment; consequently, trends toward disengagement from natural environments in today’s industrialized societies may compromise adaptive neural responses and lead to psychiatric illness. Investigations of rodents housed in enriched environments indicate enhanced neurobiological complexity; yet, the origin of these stimuli, natural vs. manufactured, has not been sufficiently explored. In the current study, groups of rats were exposed to one of three environments: (1) a standard environment with only food and water, (2) an artificial-enriched environment with manufactured stimuli and (3) a natural-enriched environment with natural stimuli. Results indicated that, during the dark phase, natural-enriched animals exhibited longer durations interacting with objects than the artificial-enriched group; further, the natural-enriched group engaged in more social behavior than the other two groups. Both enriched groups exhibited less anxiety in response to a novel object but the natural-enriched rats exhibited less anxiety-typical behavior in response to a predator odor than the other groups. Less fos activation in the amygdala was observed in both enriched groups following a water escape task whereas an increase in fos activation in the nucleus accumbens was observed in the natural-enriched animals. Thus, the current findings indicate the potential importance of exposure to complex environments, especially natural-like habitats, in the maintenance of emotional health, perhaps providing a buffer against the emergence of anxiogenic responses.

AB  - Abstract
Sensorimotor reorganization is believed to play an important role in the development and maintenance of phantom limb pain, but pain itself might modulate sensorimotor plasticity induced by deafferentation. Clinical and basic research support this idea, as pain prior to amputation increases the risk of developing post-amputation pain. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of experimental tonic cutaneous hand pain on the plasticity induced by temporary ischemic hand deafferentation. Sixteen healthy subjects participated in two experimental sessions (Pain, No Pain) in which transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to assess corticospinal excitability in two forearm muscles (flexor carpi radialis and flexor digitorum superficialis) before (T0, T10, T20, and T40) and after (T60 and T75) inflation of a cuff around the wrist. The cuff was inflated at T45 in both sessions and in the Pain session capsaicin cream was applied on the dorsum of the hand at T5. Corticospinal excitability was significantly greater during the Post-inflation phase (p = 0.002) and increased similarly in both muscles (p = 0.861). Importantly, the excitability increase in the Post-inflation phase was greater for the Pain than the No-Pain condition (p = 0.006). Post-hoc analyses revealed a significant difference between the two conditions during the Post-inflation phase (p = 0.030) but no difference during the Pre-inflation phase (p = 0.601). In other words, the corticospinal facilitation was greater when pain was present prior to cuff inflation. These results indicate that pain can modulate the plasticity induced by another event, and could partially explain the sensorimotor reorganization often reported in chronic pain populations.

Early-life events have long-term effects on brain structures and cause behavioral alterations that persist into adulthood. The present experiments were designed to investigate the effects of prenatal stress on diazepam-induced withdrawal syndrome and serotonin-1A (5HT1A) receptor expression in the raphe nuclei of adult offspring.

The results of the present study reveal that maternal exposure to chronic footshock stress increased the anxiety-like behavior in the prenatally stressed (PS) animals withdrawn from chronic diazepam (2.5 mg/kg/day i.p for 1 week). Moreover, prenatal stress induced a down-regulation of 5HT1A mRNA in the raphe nuclei of adult offspring. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that maternal exposure to chronic footshock stress enhances diazepam withdrawal symptoms and alters 5HT1A receptor gene expression in the raphe nuclei of adult offspring. Thus, more studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms underlying the decrease of 5HT1A receptors expression in the raphe nuclei of PS rats.

Stroke therapies are still limited to a minority of patients. Considering time-dependent aspects of stroke, the penumbra concept describes the transition from functional to permanent tissue damage. Thereby, the role of cytoskeletal elements, as for instance microtubules with associated tau remains poorly understood and is therefore not yet considered for therapeutic approaches. This study explored the expression of microtubule-associated protein tau related to neuronal damage in stroke-affected brain regions. Wild-type and triple-transgenic mice of 3, 7 and 12 months of age and with an Alzheimer-like background underwent experimental stroke. After 24 h, brain sections were used for immunofluorescence labeling of tau and Neuronal Nuclei (NeuN). Potential functional consequences of cellular alterations were explored by statistical relationships to the general health condition, i.e. neurobehavioral deficits and loss of body weight. Immunoreactivity for whole tau decreased significantly in ischemic areas, while the decline at the border zone was more drastic for tau-immunoreactivity compared with the diminished NeuN labeling. Quantitative analyses confirmed pronounced sensitivity for tau-immunoreactivity in the ischemic border zone. Decline of tau- as well as NeuN-immunoreactivity correlated with body weight loss during the 24-h observation period. In conclusion, microtubule-associated protein tau was robustly identified as a highly sensitive cytoskeletal constitute under ischemic conditions, suggesting a pivotal role during the transition process toward long-lasting tissue damage. Consequently, cytoskeletal elements appear as promising targets for novel therapeutic approaches with the objective to impede ischemia-induced irreversible cellular degradation.

AB  - Abstract
In monolingual humans, language-related brain activation shows a distinct lateralized pattern, in which the left hemisphere is often dominant. Studies are not as conclusive regarding the localization of the underlying neural substrate for language in sequential language learners. Lateralization of the neural substrate for first and second language depends on a number of factors including proficiency and early experience with each language. Similar to humans learning speech, songbirds learn their vocalizations from a conspecific tutor early in development. Here, we show mirrored patterns of lateralization in the avian analog of the mammalian auditory cortex (the caudomedial nidopallium [NCM]) in sequentially tutored zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata​) in response to their first tutor song, learned early in development, and their second tutor song, learned later in development. The greater the retention of song from their first tutor, the more right-dominant the birds were when exposed to that song; the more birds learned from their second tutor, the more left-dominant they were when exposed to that song. Thus, the avian auditory cortex may preserve lateralized neuronal traces of old and new tutor song memories, which are dependent on proficiency of song learning. There is striking resemblance in humans: early-formed language representations are maintained in the brain even if exposure to that language is discontinued. The switching of hemispheric dominance related to the acquisition of early auditory memories and subsequent encoding of more recent memories may be an evolutionary adaptation in vocal learners necessary for the behavioral flexibility to acquire novel vocalizations, such as a second language.

AB  - Abstract
Responses to personal space (PS) violations are variable and depend (besides many other factors) on the sex of the person who enters this space. The neuronal basis of this effect is still largely unknown. A previous neuroimaging investigation had shown that male participants responded with increased amygdala activation to PS violation, but only when the intruder was male. Gender-specific responses by females have not been studied yet. In the present study we recorded affective as well as hemodynamic responses of 30 women (mean age: M = 27.3 years; SD = 8.1). The participants were exposed to images of neutral facial expressions from men and women. All stimuli were once shown as photos (static), and once were zoomed in (picture enlargement by the factor 2.75) in order to simulate PS intrusion. In both conditions (‘static’ and ‘approaching’ faces) the eyes and mouth region of the depicted persons were always completely visible. Approaching faces generally provoked activation of a parietal network (e.g., intraparietal sulcus, superior/inferior parietal cortex). When the approaching person was male additional amygdala activation was detected.

Because the amygdala is a central structure for the initiation of defense responses, the heightened activation might reflect that male intrusion was decoded as potential threat. Hence, we observed a similar gender bias to simulated space intrusion in women as previously in men.

In hypoglossal motoneurons, a sustained anionic current, sensitive to a blocker of ρ-containing GABA receptors, (1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)methylphosphinic acid (TPMPA) and insensitive to bicuculline, was previously shown to be activated by gabazine. In order to better characterize the receptors involved, the sensitivity of this atypical response to pentobarbital (30 μM), allopregnanolone (0.3 μM) and midazolam (0.5 μM) was first investigated. Pentobarbital potentiated the response, whereas the steroid and the benzodiazepine were ineffective. The results indicate the involvement of hybrid heteromeric receptors, including at least a GABA receptor ρ subunit and a γ subunit, accounting for the pentobarbital-sensitivity. The effects of the endogenous β amino acids, taurine and β-alanine, which are released under various pathological conditions and show neuroprotective properties, were then studied. In the presence of the glycine receptor blocker strychnine (1 μM), both taurine (0.3–1 mM) and β-alanine (0.3 mM) activated sustained anionic currents, which were partly blocked by TPMPA (100 μM). Thus, both β amino acids activated ρ-containing GABA receptors in hypoglossal motoneurons. Bicuculline (20 μM) reduced responses to taurine and β-alanine, but small sustained responses persisted in the presence of both strychnine and bicuculline. Responses to β-alanine were slightly increased by allopregnanolone, indicating a contribution of the bicuculline- and neurosteroid-sensitive GABAA receptors underlying tonic inhibition in these motoneurons. Since sustained activation of anionic channels inhibits most mature principal neurons, the ρ-containing GABA receptors permanently activated by taurine and β-alanine might contribute to some of their neuroprotective properties under damaging overexcitatory situations.

AB  - Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia in the elderly, is characterized by the presence of extracellular plaques composed of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides and intracellular tau aggregates. The plaques are surrounded by microglia, the brain’s resident immune cells, which likely participate in the clearance of Aβ by phagocytosis. The microglia that are associated with plaques display an abnormal ameboid morphology and do not respond to tissue damage, in contrast to microglia in healthy brains. Here, we used time lapse confocal microscopy to perform a detailed real-time examination of microglial motility in acute hippocampal brain slices from the 5xFAD mouse model of AD, which was crossed to Cx3cr1GFP/GFP mice to achieve microglia-specific GFP expression for visualization. During baseline conditions, microglia around plaques appeared hypermotile, moving the processes that were pointing away from plaques at higher speed than microglia not associated with plaques. Yet, neither plaque-associated, nor plaque-free microglia were able to extend processes toward sites of modest mechanical damage. Application of the selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist preladenant, which restores microglial response to cellular damage in a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease, reduced the hypermotility of plaque-associated microglia, but did not restore motility toward damaged cells in slices from 5xFAD mice. Our results suggest that process hypermotility and resistance to A2A antagonism during response to tissue damage may represent unique functional phenotypes of plaque-associated microglia that impair their ability to function properly in the AD brain.

AB  - Abstract
Decrease in brain amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation is a leading strategy for treating Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the intrinsic mechanism of the regulation of brain Aβ production is largely unknown. Previously, we reported that ILEI (also referred to as FAM3C) binds to the γ-secretase complex and suppresses Aβ production without inhibiting γ-secretase activity. In this study, we examined ILEI expression in mouse brain using immunohistochemistry and subcellular fractionation. Brain ILEI showed widespread expression in neurons and ependymal cells but not in glial and vascular endothelial cells. Neuronal ILEI resided in perinuclear vesicular structures, which were positive for a marker protein of the trans-Golgi network. Although ILEI immunostaining was negative at synaptic terminals, synaptosome fractionation analysis suggested that ILEI was enriched in presynaptic terminals, particularly in the active zone-docked synaptic vesicles. ILEI expression levels in brain peaked during the postnatal period and declined with age. In comparison with age-matched control brains, the number of ILEI-immunoreactive neurons decreased in AD brains, although the subcellular localization was unaltered. Our results suggest that a decline of ILEI expression may cause accumulation of Aβ in the brain and the eventual development of AD.

AB  - Abstract
Coping skills are essential in determining the outcomes of aversive life events. Our research was aimed to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of different coping styles in two inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J and SWR/J. We compared the influence of a preceding stressor (0.5 h of restraint) on behavioral and gene expression profiles between these two strains. The C57BL/6J strain exhibited increased conditioned fear and high immobility (passive coping). Oppositely, the SWR/J mice demonstrated low freezing and immobility, low post-restraint anxiety and considerable struggling during the forced swim test (active coping). Gene profiling in the amygdala revealed transcriptional patterns that were related to the differential stress reactivity, such as the activation of glucocorticoid-dependent genes specifically in the C57BL/6J mice. Post-restraint blood sampling for corticosterone levels confirmed the association of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) activation with a passive coping style. Pharmacological tools were used to modulate the stress-coping strategies. The blockade of opioid receptors (ORs) before the aversive event caused transcriptional and neuroendocrine changes in the SWR/J mice that were characteristic of the passive coping strategy. We found that treatment with a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist (dexamethasone (DEX), 4 mg/kg) impaired the consolidation of fear memory in the C57BL/6J mice and that this effect was reversed by OR blockade (naltrexone (NTX), 2 mg/kg). In parallel, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist (mifepristone (MIF), 20 mg/kg) reversed the effect of morphine (20 mg/kg) on conditioned fear in the C57BL/6J mice. Our results suggest that in mice, stress-coping strategies are determined by opioid-dependent mechanisms that modulate activity of the HPA axis.

AB  - Abstract
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a common autoimmune disease that inevitably causes inflammatory nerve demyelination. However, an effective approach to prevent its course is still lacking and urgently needed. Recently, the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) has emerged as a novel inflammation regulator. Manipulation of A2AR activity may suppress the MS process and protect against nerve damage. To test this hypothesis, we treated murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for MS, with the selective A2AR agonist, CGS21680 (CGS). We evaluated the effects of CGS on the pathological features of EAE progression, including CNS cellular infiltration, inflammatory cytokine expression, lymphocyte proliferation, and cell surface markers. Treatment with CGS significantly suppressed specific lymphocyte proliferation, reduced infiltration of CD4+ T lymphocytes, and attenuated the expression of inflammatory cytokines, which in turn inhibited the EAE progression. For the first time, we demonstrate that CGS can increase the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in murine lymphocytes, which may be the mechanism underlying the suppressive effects of CGS-induced A2AR activation on EAE progression. Our findings strongly suggest that A2AR is a potential therapeutic target for MS and provide insight into the mechanism of action of A2AR agonists, which may offer a therapeutic option for this disease.

AB  - Abstract
We previously found that oxytocin (OT) receptor (OTR) binding density in the medial amygdala (MeA) correlated positively with social interest (i.e., the motivation to investigate a conspecific) in male rats, while OTR binding density in the central amygdala (CeA) correlated negatively with social interest in female rats. Here, we determined the causal involvement of OTR in the MeA and CeA in the sex-specific regulation of social interest in adult rats by injecting an OTR antagonist (5 ng/0.5 μl/side) or OT (100 pg/0.5 μl/side) before the social interest test (4-min same-sex juvenile exposure). OTR blockade in the CeA decreased social interest in males but not females, while all other treatments had no behavioral effect. To further explore the sex-specific involvement of the OT system in the CeA in social interest, we used in vivo microdialysis to determine possible sex differences in endogenous OT release in the CeA during social interest. Interestingly, males and females showed similar levels of extracellular OT release at baseline and during social interest, suggesting that factors other than local OT release mediate the sex-specific role of CeA-OTR in social interest. Moreover, we found a positive correlation between CeA-OT release and social investigation time in females. This was further reflected by reduced CeA-OT release during social interest in females that expressed low compared to high social interest. We discuss the possibility that this reduction in OT release may be a consequence, rather than a cause, of exposure to a social stimulus. Overall, our findings show for the first time that extracellular OT release in the CeA is similar between males and females and that OTR in the CeA plays a causal role in the regulation of social interest toward juvenile conspecifics in males.

AB  - Abstract
The use of more ethological animal models to study the neurobiology of anxiety has increased in recent years. We assessed the effect of an environmental enrichment (EE) protocol (24 h/day over a period of two months) on anxiety-related behaviors when aged Wistar rats (21 months old) were confronted with cat odor stimuli. Owing to the relationship between GABAergic interneurons and the anxiety-related neuronal network, we examined changes in the expression of Parvalbumin (PV) and 67 kDa form of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-67) immunoreactive cells in different brain regions involved in stress response. Behavioral results revealed that enriched rats traveled further and made more grooming behaviors during the habituation session. In the cat odor session, they traveled longer distances and they showed more active interaction with the odor stimuli and less time in freezing behavior. Zone analysis revealed that the enriched group spent more time in the intermediate zone according to the proximity of the predator odor. Regarding the neurobiological data, the EE increased the expression of PV-positive cells in some medial prefrontal regions (cingulate (Cg) and prelimbic (PL) cortices), whereas the GAD-67 expression in the basolateral amygdala was reduced in the enriched group. Our results suggest that EE is able to reduce anxiety-like behaviors in aged animals even when ethologically relevant stimuli are used. Moreover, GABAergic interneurons could be involved in mediating this resilient behavior.

AB  - Abstract
Prenatal stress is a risk factor for abnormal neuroanatomical, cognitive, behavioral and mental health outcomes with potentially transgenerational consequences. Females in general seem more resilient to the effects of prenatal stress than males. Here, we examined if repeated stress across generations may diminish stress resiliency and cumulatively enhance the susceptibility for adverse health outcomes in females. Pregnant female rats of three successive generations were exposed to stress from gestational days 12–18 to generate multigenerational prenatal stress (MPS) in the maternal lineage. Stress response was measured by plasma corticosterone levels and open-field exploration in each generation. Neuromorphological consequences of MPS were investigated in the F3 generation using in vivo manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI), T2-relaxometry, and cytoarchitectonics in relation to candidate gene expression involved in brain plasticity and mental health. Each additional generation of prenatal stress incrementally elevated hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis activation, anxiety-like and aversive behaviors in adult female offspring. Elevated stress responses in the MPS F3 generation were accompanied by reduced neural density in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and whole brain along with altered brain activation patterns in in vivo MEMRI. MPS increased ephrin receptor A5 (Epha5), neuronal growth regulator (Negr1) and synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (Snap25) gene expression and reduced fibroblast growth factor 12 (Fgf12) in prefrontal cortex. These genes regulate neuronal maturation, arborization and synaptic plasticity and may explain altered brain cytoarchitectonics and connectivity. These findings emphasize that recurrent stress across generations may cumulatively increase stress vulnerability and the risk of adverse health outcomes through perinatal programing in females.

AB  - Abstract
Previous studies have shown that iron redistribution and deposition in the brain occurs in some neurodegenerative diseases, and oxidative damage due to abnormal iron level is a primary cause of neuronal death. In the present study, we used the single prolonged stress (SPS) model to mimic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and examined whether iron was involved in the progression of PTSD. The anxiety-like behaviors of the SPS group were assessed by the elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field tests, and iron levels were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). Expression of glucocorticoid receptors and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and ferritin (Fn) was detected by Western blot and immunohistochemistry in selected brain areas; TfR1 and Fn mRNA expression were detected by quantitative-polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). Ultrastructures of the hippocampus were observed under a transmission electron microscope. Our results showed that SPS exposure induced anxiety-like symptoms and increased the level of serum cortisol and the concentration of iron in key brain areas such as the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and striatum. The stress induced region-specific changes in both protein and mRNA levels of TfR1 and Fn. Moreover, swelling mitochondria and cell apoptosis were observed in neurons in brain regions with iron accumulation. We concluded that SPS stress increased iron in some cognition-related brain regions and subsequently cause neuronal injury, indicating that the iron may function in the pathology of PTSD.

AB  - Abstract
Clinical depression is one of the most common and debilitating psychiatric disorders and contributes to increased risks of disability and suicide. Differentially expressed serum proteins may serve as biomarkers for diagnosing depression. In this study, samples from depressed patients are aggregated into a pool (22 × 100 μL serum was used) and samples from healthy volunteers are aggregated into the other pool (20 × 100 μL serum was used). Isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technology and tandem mass spectrometry were employed to screen for differentially expressed serum protein in two separate pools. We identified 472 proteins in the serum samples, and 154 of these presented differences in abundance between the depression and control groups. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was employed to identify the highest scoring proteins in signaling pathway networks. Finally, four differentially expressed proteins were validated by enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA). Proteomic studies revealed that levels of c-reaction protein (CRP), inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 (ITIH4), serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) and angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) were substantially increased in depressed patients compared with the healthy control group. Therefore, these differentially expressed proteins may represent potential markers for the clinical diagnosis of depression.

AB  - Abstract
The organization of the inhibitory intercalated cell masses (IM) of the primate amygdala is largely unknown despite their key role in emotional processes. We studied the structural, topographic, neurochemical and intrinsic connectional features of IM neurons in the rhesus monkey brain. We found that the intercalated neurons are not confined to discrete cell clusters, but form a neuronal net that is interposed between the basal nuclei and extends to the dorsally located anterior, central, and medial nuclei of the amygdala. Unlike the IM in rodents, which are prominent in the anterior half of the amygdala, the primate inhibitory net stretched throughout the antero-posterior axis of the amygdala, and was most prominent in the central and posterior extent of the amygdala. There were two morphologic types of intercalated neurons: spiny and aspiny. Spiny neurons were the most abundant; their somata were small or medium size, round or elongated, and their dendritic trees were round or bipolar, depending on location. The aspiny neurons were on average slightly larger and had varicose dendrites with no spines. There were three non-overlapping neurochemical populations of IM neurons, in descending order of abundance: (1) Spiny neurons that were positive for the striatal associated dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32+); (2) Aspiny neurons that expressed the calcium-binding protein calbindin (CB+); and (3) Aspiny neurons that expressed nitric oxide synthase (NOS+). The unique combinations of structural and neurochemical features of the three classes of IM neurons suggest different physiological properties and function. The three types of IM neurons were intermingled and likely interconnected in distinct ways, and were innervated by intrinsic neurons within the amygdala, or by external sources, in pathways that underlie fear conditioning and anxiety.

AB  - Abstract
This study aimed to test the hypothesis that, during extended wakefulness, parasympathetic activity is associated with the depth of the subsequent recovery sleep in mice. Fourteen male C57BL/6 mice were implanted with electrodes for sleep recording. Continuous spectral analysis was performed on the electroencephalogram (EEG) to obtain theta power (6–9 Hz) and delta power (0–4 Hz), as well as the R-R interval signals in order to quantify the high-frequency power (HF) and normalized low-frequency power (LF%) that are used to assess parasympathetic and sympathetic activity, respectively. All animals underwent a sleep deprivation experiment and a control experiment (6-h intervention and 1-h recovery period) on two separate days. During sleep deprivation, HF and theta power during wakefulness were significantly higher than during the control wakefulness after the second hour and first hour, respectively. During recovery non-rapid eye movement sleep, there was a rebound in sleep time and delta power as well as an elevation in HF relative to control post-intervention sleep. Both the rise in HF and theta power during extended wakefulness were found to be positively correlated with the delta power rebound. Furthermore, the HF change during extended wakefulness was also correlated with the amount of sleep loss and the enhancement of waking theta power. Our finding suggests that waking parasympathetic activity intimately reflects the cumulative sleep pressure, suggesting a potential role to be an autonomic marker for sleep propensity.

Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) has been implicated in stress adaptation with potential relevance in mood disorder management. PACAP deficient (KO) mice on CD1 background were shown to have depression-like phenotype. Here we aimed at investigating effects of chronic variable mild stress (CVMS) in non-injected, vehicle and imipramine-treated KO mice vs. wildtype (WT) counterparts. We hypothesized reduced FosB neuronal activity in stress-related centers, altered activity and peptide/neurotransmitter content of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) cells of the oval (ovBST) bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BST), urocortin 1 (Ucn1) neurons of centrally projecting Edinger-Westphal nucleus (cpEW) and serotonin (5HT) cells of dorsal raphe (DR) in PACAP deficiency.

CVMS caused decreased body weight and increased adrenal size, corticosterone (CORT) titers and depression-like behavior in WT mice, in contrast to KO animals. CVMS increased FosB in the central (CeA) and medial amygdala, dorsomedial (dmBST), ventral (vBST), ovBST, CA1 area, dentate gyrus (DG), ventral lateral septum, parvo- (pPVN) and magnocellular paraventricular nucleus, lateral periaqueductal gray, cpEW and DR. Lack of PACAP blunted the CVMS-induced FosB rise in the CeA, ovBST, dmBST, vBST, CA1 area, pPVN and DR.

The CVMS-induced FosB expression in ovBST-CRF and cpEW-Ucn1 neurons was abolished in KO mice. Although CVMS did not induce FosB in 5HT-DR neurons, PACAP KO mice had increased 5HT cell counts and 5HT content.

We conclude that PACAP deficiency affects neuronal reactivity in a brain area-specific manner in stress centers, as well as in ovBST-CRF, cpEW-Ucn1 and 5HT-DR neurons leading to reduced CVMS response and altered depression level.

AB  - Abstract
Astrocytes play multiple important roles in brain physiology. In pathological conditions, they become reactive, which is characterized by morphological changes and upregulation of intermediate filament proteins. Besides these descriptive hallmarks, astrocyte reactivity involves significant transcriptional and functional changes that are far from being fully understood. Most importantly, astrocyte reactivity seems to encompass multiple states, each having a specific influence on surrounding cells and disease progression.

These diverse functional states of reactivity must be regulated by subtle signaling networks. Many signaling cascades have been associated with astrocyte reactivity, but among them, the JAK–STAT3 pathway is emerging as a central regulator.

In this review, we aim (i) to show that the JAK–STAT3 pathway plays a key role in the control of astrocyte reactivity, (ii) to illustrate that STAT3 is a pleiotropic molecule operating multiple functions in reactive astrocytes, and (iii) to suggest that each specific functional state of reactivity is governed by complex molecular interactions within astrocytes, which converge on STAT3.

More research is needed to precisely identify the signaling networks controlling the diverse states of astrocyte reactivity. Only then, we will be able to precisely delineate the therapeutic potential of reactive astrocytes in each neurological disease context.

AB  - Abstract
Recent studies have demonstrated that anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) modify cognitive processes such as decision making and behavioral flexibility. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these AAS-induced cognitive changes remain poorly understood. The mesocorticolimbic dopamine (DA) system, particularly the nucleus accumbens (Acb), is important for reward, motivated behavior, and higher cognitive processes such as decision making. Therefore, AAS-induced plasticity in the DA system is a potential structural substrate for the observed cognitive alterations. High doses of testosterone (the most commonly-used AAS) increase dendritic spine density in limbic regions including the amygdala and hippocampus. However, effects on Acb are unknown. This was the focus of the present study. Adolescent male Long-Evans rats were treated chronically for 8 weeks with high-dose testosterone (7.5 mg/kg in water with 13% cyclodextrin) or vehicle sc. Brains were stained by Golgi–Cox to analyze neuronal morphology in medium spiny neurons of the shell region of Acb (AcbSh). Eight weeks of testosterone treatment significantly decreased spine density in AcbSh compared to brains of vehicle-treated rats (F1,14 = 5.455, p &lt; 0.05). Testosterone did not significantly affect total spine number, dendritic length, or arborization measured by Sholl analysis. These results show that AAS alter neuronal morphology in AcbSh by decreasing spine density throughout the dendritic tree, and provides a potential mechanism for AAS to modify cognition and decision-making behavior.

AB  - Abstract
Systemic injections of 17β-estradiol (E2) in ovariectomized (OVX) female rats rapidly enhance dorsal striatal dopamine (DA) release in response to amphetamine (AMPH). Additionally, a single injection of E2 rapidly (within 30 min) enhances amphetamine-induced DA release. In situ studies show that this rapid effect of E2 occurs specifically within the dorsal striatum (DS). The present study investigated the in vivo effects of E2 infused into the DS, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) or the substantia nigra (SN) on dorsal striatal DA release. Rats were OVX and implanted with a silastic tube containing 5% E2 in cholesterol, previously shown to mimic low physiological serum concentrations of 18–32 pg/ml. Single-probe microdialysis was used to measure extracellular DA levels in the DS. In addition, DA release was measured subsequent to systemic injections of the indirect DA agonist, AMPH (0.5 mg/kg SC), administered simultaneously with E2 (0.544 μg/100 μl) or its vehicle, cyclodextrin (VEH) (0.520 μg/100 μl). Local infusions of E2 into the DS resulted in a greater amphetamine-induced dorsal striatal DA release in comparison to vehicle. Local infusions of E2 into the mPFC or the SN did not result in an enhancement of amphetamine-induced DA levels in the DS. These studies suggest that increases in dorsal striatal DA release in response to systemic E2 are a consequence of E2 actions within the DS itself.

AB  - Abstract
Low frequency stimulation (LFS) has been proposed as a new approach in the treatment of epilepsy. The anticonvulsant mechanism of LFS may be through its effect on GABAA receptors, which are the main target of phenobarbital anticonvulsant action. We supposed that co-application of LFS and phenobarbital may increase the efficacy of phenobarbital. Therefore, the interaction of LFS and phenobarbital on GABAergic inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSCs) in kindled and control rats was investigated. Animals were kindled by electrical stimulation of basolateral amygdala in a semi rapid manner (12 stimulations/day). The effect of phenobarbital, LFS and phenobarbital + LFS was investigated on GABAA-mediated evoked and miniature IPSCs in the hippocampal brain slices in control and fully kindled animals. Phenobarbital and LFS had positive interaction on GABAergic currents. In vitro co-application of an ineffective pattern of LFS (100 pulses at afterdischarge threshold intensity) and a sub-threshold dose of phenobarbital (100 μM) which had no significant effect on GABAergic currents alone, increased the amplitude and area under curve of GABAergic currents in CA1 pyramidal neurons of hippocampal slices significantly. Interestingly, the sub-threshold dose of phenobarbital potentiated the GABAergic currents when applied on the hippocampal slices of kindled animals which received LFS in vivo. Post-synaptic mechanisms may be involved in observed interactions. Obtained results implied a positive interaction between LFS and phenobarbital through GABAA currents. It may be suggested that a combined therapy of phenobarbital and LFS may be a useful manner for reinforcing the anticonvulsant action of phenobarbital.

AB  - Abstract
We have previously demonstrated that inferotemporal neurons respond to objects viewed from a range of angles, even without any prior experience in learning the associations among the views. Several models have been proposed to explain object recognition across disparate views. However, direct neuronal evidence is rare. In the present study, we focused on the response similarity of a population of inferotemporal cells to object views, following different prior experiences. Two monkeys were subjected to a task in which object discrimination across views was required. We found significantly higher neural response similarity to 30° separated views, 190 ms after object image presentation, than without any prior discrimination experience across views. The time period over which the similarity was significant began and endured similarly for 60° separated views at 190–850 ms. For 90° separated views, the time period over which the similarity was significant was shorter and started later, at 230–550 ms. The results demonstrate the dynamics of cell population activity and suggest a possible explanation for object recognition across disparate views.

AB  - Abstract
The triceps surae comprises an important group of muscles for human posture and gait. The soleus unlike other limb muscles shows atypical lower firing rates in both old and young adults across various voluntary strength levels, including maximal contractions. The other portion of the triceps surae, the gastrocnemii has not been explored in aging, and despite anatomic, histochemical and age-related morphological differences, they share many common functions with soleus. During multiple visits, 10 active young (23–33 years) and 10 active old participants (76–86 years) performed a series of plantar flexor isometric contractions at a range of contraction intensities including maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) with tungsten microelectrodes inserted into the lateral (LG) and medial (MG) gastrocnemius. Despite equal and near maximal voluntary activation (VA) (∼98%), MVC torque was ∼46% lower, twitch tension was ∼34% lower, and contractile speed was ∼15% slower in the old men compared with the young. At all isometric torque levels tested (25, 50, 75 and 100% MVC) there were no statistically significant differences in mean motor unit firing rates (MUFRs) between young and old men. In both groups, the range of mean MU firing rates was similar (∼8 Hz at 25% MVC to ∼22 Hz at 100% MVC). The structural age-related changes in the gastrocnemii are not reflected in neural drive adaptations, indicating that MUFRs may not be a common feature with aging and other factors such as habitual use or anatomical location may be influential.

AB  - Abstract
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master enzyme that regulates ATP-sensitive K+ (K-ATP) channels in pancreatic beta-cells and cardiac myocytes. We used patch pipettes to record currents and potentials to investigate effects of AMPK on K-ATP currents in substantia nigra compacta (SNC) dopamine neurons in slices of rat midbrain. When slices were superfused repeatedly with the K-ATP channel opener diazoxide, we were surprised to find that diazoxide currents gradually increased in magnitude, reaching 300% of the control value 60 min after starting whole-cell recording. However, diazoxide current increased significantly more, to 472% of control, when recorded in the presence of the AMPK activator A769662. Moreover, superfusing the slice with the AMPK blocking agent dorsomorphin significantly reduced diazoxide current to 38% of control. Control experiments showed that outward currents evoked by the K-ATP channel opener NN-414 also increased over time, but not currents evoked by the GABAB agonist baclofen. Delaying the application of diazoxide after starting whole-cell recording correlated with augmentation of current. Loose-patch recording showed that diazoxide produced a 34% slowing of spontaneous firing rate that did not intensify with repeated applications of diazoxide. However, superfusion with A769662 significantly augmented the inhibitory effect of diazoxide on firing rate. We conclude that K-ATP channel function is augmented by AMPK, which is activated during the process of making whole-cell recordings. Our results suggest that AMPK and K-ATP interactions may play an important role in regulating dopamine neuronal excitability.

AB  - Abstract
The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)/Siah1 signaling pathway has been recognized as a sensor of nitric oxide (NO). It is associated with a variety of injurious conditions, suggesting its therapeutic potential for spinal cord injury (SCI). Sivelestat sodium (SIV), a neutrophil elastase (NE) inhibitor initially used to treat acute lung injury, has been known to protect against compression-induced and ischemic SCI. However, little is known about the relationship between the GAPDH/Siah1 cascade and SIV. Thus, we aimed to assess the role of GAPDH/Siah1 cascade in traumatic SCI and its possible link with SIV. Rats were assigned to four groups: sham group, SCI group, 5-mg/kg SIV group, and 10-mg/kg SIV. The traumatic SCI was induced by dropping a 10-g impactor from a height of 25 mm on the dorsal surface of T9 and T10. SIV was injected intraperitoneally immediately after surgery. Our results showed that the nuclear translocation of GAPDH was induced together with the nuclear translocation of Siah1 and the formation of the GAPDH/Siah1 complex in the spinal cord after traumatic SCI. However, the activation of the GAPDH/Siah1 cascade was attenuated by treatment with SIV. We also found that SIV suppressed apoptosis, NE and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein expressions, the number of NE and iNOS immunostained cells, the production of interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and the activation of nuclear factor kappa light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling in the spinal cord. The behavioral tests showed that SIV promoted functional recovery after traumatic SCI as reflected in the sustained increase in the Basso–Beattie–Bresnahan (BBB) scores throughout the observation period. In conclusion, our results reveal GAPDH/Siah1 as a novel signaling pathway during the progression of SCI, which can be blocked by SIV.

AB  - Abstract
Several studies have suggested that the thalamic centromedian–parafascicular (CM/PF or the PF in rodents) is implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, inconsistent changes in the neuronal firing rate and pattern have been reported in parkinsonian animals. To investigate the impact of a dopaminergic cell lesion on PF extracellular discharge in behaving rats, the PF neural activities in the spike and local field potential (LFP) were recorded in unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine- (6-OHDA) lesioned and neurologically intact control rats during rest and limb movement. During rest, the two PF neuronal subtypes was less spontaneously active, with no difference in the spike firing rates between the control and lesioned rats; only the lesioned rats reshaped their spike firing pattern. Furthermore, the simultaneously recorded LFP in the lesioned rats exhibited a significant increase in power at 12–35 and 35–70 Hz and a decrease in power at 0.7–12 Hz. During the execution of a voluntary movement, two subtypes of PF neurons were identified by a rapid increase in the discharge activity in both the control and lesioned rats. However, dopamine lesioning was associated with a decrease in neuronal spiking fire rate and reshaping in the firing pattern in the PF. The simultaneously recorded LFP activity exhibited a significant increase in power at 12–35 Hz and a decrease in power at 0.7–12 Hz compared with the control rats. These findings indicate that 6-OHDA induces modifications in PF spike and LFP activities in rats during rest and movement and suggest that PF dysfunction may be an important contributor to the pathophysiology of parkinsonian motor impairment.

Spatial neglect is modeled on an imbalance of interhemispheric inhibition (IHI); however evidence is emerging that it may not explain neglect in all cases. The aim of this study was to investigate the IHI imbalance model of visual neglect in healthy adults, using paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation to probe excitability of projections from posterior parietal cortex (PPC) to contralateral primary motor cortex (M1) bilaterally. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the first dorsal interossei and facilitation was determined as ratio of conditioned to non-conditioned MEP amplitude. A laterality index reflecting the balance of excitability between the two hemispheres was calculated. A temporal order judgment task (TOJ) assessed visual attention. Continuous theta-burst stimulation was used to transiently suppress right parietal cortex activity and the effect on laterality and judgment task measured, along with associations between baseline and post stimulation measures. Stimulation had conflicting results on laterality, with most participants demonstrating an effect in the negative direction with no decrement in the TOJ task. Correlation analysis suggests a strong association between laterality direction and degree of facilitation of left PPC-to right M1 following stimulation (r = .902), with larger MEP facilitation at baseline demonstrating greater reduction (r = −.908). Findings indicate there was relative balance between the cortices at baseline but right PPC suppression did not evoke left PPC facilitation in most participants, contrary to the IHI imbalance model. Left M1 facilitation prior to stimulation may predict an individual’s response to continuous theta-burst stimulation of right PPC.

Hypoglycemia is defined by an arbitrary plasma glucose level lower than 3.9 mmol/L and is a most common and feared adverse effect of treatment of diabetes mellitus. Emerging evidences demonstrated that hypoglycemia could induce enhanced apoptosis. Lithium chloride (LiCl), a FDA approved drug clinically used for treatment of bipolar disorders, is recently proven having neuroprotection against various stresses in the cellular and animal models of neural disorders. Here, we have established a hypoglycemia model in vitro and assessed the neuroprotective efficacy of LiCl against hypoglycemia-induced apoptosis and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Our studies showed that LiCl protects against hypoglycemia-induced neurotoxicity in vitro. Exposure to hypoglycemia results in enhanced apoptosis and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms involved inhibition of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway by decreasing wnt3a levels, β-catenin levels and increasing GSK-3β levels, which was confirmed by the use of Wnt-specific activator LiCl. Hypoglycemia-induced apoptosis were significantly reversed by LiCl, leading to increased cell survival. LiCl also alters the expression/levels of the Wnt pathway genes/proteins, which were reduced due to exposed to hypoglycemia. Overall, our results conclude that LiCl provides neuroprotection against hypoglycemia-induced apoptosis via activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.

AB  - Abstract
Brain bioenergetic abnormalities in mood disorders were detected by neuroimaging in vivo studies in humans. Because of the increasing importance of mitochondrial pathogenetic hypothesis of Depression, in this study the effects of sub-chronic treatment (21 days) with desipramine (15 mg/kg) and fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) were evaluated on brain energy metabolism. On mitochondria in vivo located in neuronal soma (somatic) and on mitochondria of synapses (synaptic), the catalytic activities of regulatory enzymes of mitochondrial energy-yielding metabolic pathways were assayed.

Antidepressants in vivo treatment modified the activities of selected enzymes of different mitochondria, leading to metabolic modifications in the energy metabolism of brain cortex: (a) the enhancement of cytochrome oxidase activity on somatic mitochondria; (b) the decrease of malate, succinate dehydrogenase and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase activities of synaptic mitochondria; (c) the selective effect of fluoxetine on enzymes related to glutamate metabolism.

These results overcome the conflicting data so far obtained with antidepressants on brain energy metabolism, because the enzymatic analyses were made on mitochondria with diversified neuronal in vivo localization, i.e. on somatic and synaptic. This research is the first investigation on the pharmacodynamics of antidepressants studied at subcellular level, in the perspective of (i) assessing the role of energy metabolism of cerebral mitochondria in animal models of mood disorders, and (ii) highlighting new therapeutical strategies for antidepressants targeting brain bioenergetics.

AB  - Abstract
Damage to the mammillothalamic tract (MTT) produces memory impairments in both humans and rats, yet it is still not clear why this diencephalic pathway is vital for memory. One suggestion is that it is an important route for midbrain inputs to reach a wider cortical and subcortical network that supports memory. Consistent with this idea, MTT lesions produce widespread hypoactivity in distal brain regions as measured by the immediate-early gene, c-fos. To determine whether these findings were selective to c-fos or reflected more general changes in neuronal function, we assessed the effects of MTT lesions on the expression of the immediate-early gene protein, Zif268 and the metabolic marker, cytochrome oxidase, in the retrosplenial cortex and hippocampus. The lesions decreased levels of both activity markers in the superficial and deep layers of the retrosplenial cortex in both its granular and dysgranular subregions. In contrast, no significant changes were observed in the hippocampus, despite the MTT-lesioned animals showing marked impairments on T-maze alternation. These findings are consistent with MTT lesions providing important, indirect inputs for normal retrosplenial cortex functioning. These distal functional changes may contribute to the memory impairments observed after MTT lesions.

AB  - Abstract
Polysialated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) is a membrane bound glycoprotein widely expressed during nervous system development. While commonly described in the neurogenic niches of the adult human brain, there is limited evidence of its distribution in other brain regions. PSA-NCAM is an important regulator of cell–cell interactions and facilitates cell migration and plasticity. Recent evidence suggests these functions may be altered in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). This study provides a detailed description of the PSA-NCAM distribution throughout the human brain and quantitatively compares the staining load in cortical regions and sub-cortical structures between the control, AD and PD brain. Our results provide evidence of widespread, yet specific, PSA-NCAM expression throughout the human brain including regions devoid of PSA-NCAM in the rodent brain such as the caudate nucleus (CN) and cerebellum (CB). We also detected a significant reduction in PSA-NCAM load in the entorhinal cortex (EC) of cases that was inversely correlated with hyperphosphorylated tau load. These results demonstrate that PSA-NCAM-mediated structural plasticity may not be limited to neurogenic niches and is conserved in the aged brain. We also provide evidence that PSA-NCAM is reduced in the EC, a region severely affected by AD pathology.

AB  - Abstract
Short-term immobilization that reduces muscle use for 8–10 h is known to influence cortical excitability and motor performance. However, the mechanisms through which this is achieved, and whether these changes can be used to modify cortical plasticity and motor skill learning, are not known. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of short-term immobilization on use-dependent cortical plasticity, motor learning and retention. Twenty-one adults were divided into control and immobilized groups, both of which underwent two experimental sessions on consecutive days. Within each session, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to assess motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes, short- (SICI) and long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI), and intracortical facilitation (ICF) before and after a grooved pegboard task. Prior to the second training session, the immobilized group underwent 8 h of left hand immobilization targeting the index finger, while control subjects were allowed normal limb use. Immobilization produced a reduction in MEP amplitudes, but no change in SICI, LICI or ICF. While motor performance improved for both groups in each session, the level of performance was greater 24-h later in control, but not immobilized subjects. Furthermore, training-related MEP facilitation was greater after, compared with before, immobilization. These results indicate that immobilization can modulate use-dependent plasticity and the retention of motor skills. They also suggest that changes in intracortical excitability are unlikely to contribute to the immobilization-induced modification of cortical excitability.

AB  - Abstract
The amygdala has been associated with a variety of functions linked to physiological, behavioral and endocrine responses during emotional situations. This brain region is comprised of multiple sub-nuclei. These sub-nuclei belong to the same structure, but may be involved in different functions, thereby making the study of each sub-nuclei important. Yet, the involvement of the basomedial amygdala (BMA) in the regulation of emotional states has yet to be defined. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate the regulatory role of the BMA on the responses evoked during a social novelty model and whether the regulatory role depended on an interaction with the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH). Our results showed that the chemical inhibition of the BMA by the microinjection of muscimol (γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) agonist) promoted increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR), whereas the chemical inhibition of regions near the BMA did not induce such cardiovascular changes. In contrast, the BMA chemical activation by the bilateral microinjection of bicuculline methiodide (BMI; GABAA antagonist), blocked the increases in MAP and HR observed when an intruder rat was suddenly introduced into the cage of a resident rat, and confined to the small cage for 15 min. Additionally, the increase in HR and MAP induced by BMA inhibition were eliminated by DMH chemical inhibition. Thus, our data reveal that the BMA is under continuous GABAergic influence, and that its hyperactivation can reduce the physiological response induced by a social novelty condition, possibly by inhibiting DMH neurons.

AB  - Abstract
Migraine is the third most common disease worldwide, the most common neurological disorder, and one of the most common pain conditions. Despite its prevalence, the basic physiology and underlying mechanisms contributing to the development of migraine are still poorly understood and development of new therapeutic targets is long overdue. Until recently, the major contributing pathophysiological event thought to initiate migraine was cerebral and meningeal arterial vasodilation. However, the role of vasodilation in migraine is unclear and recent findings challenge its necessity. While vasodilation itself may not contribute to migraine, it remains possible that vessels play a role in migraine pathophysiology in the absence of vasodilation. Blood vessels consist of a variety of cell types that both release and respond to numerous mediators including growth factors, cytokines, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and nitric oxide (NO). Many of these mediators have actions on neurons that can contribute to migraine. Conversely, neurons release factors such as norepinephrine and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) that act on cells native to blood vessels. Both normal and pathological events occurring within and between vascular cells could thus mediate bi-directional communication between vessels and the nervous system, without the need for changes in vascular tone. This review will discuss the potential contribution of the vasculature, specifically endothelial cells, to current neuronal mechanisms hypothesized to play a role in migraine. Hypothalamic activity, cortical spreading depression (CSD), and dural afferent input from the cranial meninges will be reviewed with a focus on how these mechanisms can influence or be impacted by blood vessels. Together, the data discussed will provide a framework by which vessels can be viewed as important potential contributors to migraine pathophysiology, even in light of the current uncertainty over the role of vasodilation in this disorder.

AB  - Abstract
Neuropathic pain encompasses a broad range of conditions associated with a lesion or disease of the peripheral or central somatosensory system and its prevalence in the general population may be as high as 7–8%. The interest in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain has increased over the last two decades with an exponential increase in the number of experimental studies. However, despite the hopes raised by scientific discoveries, there has been no rational development of a truly new class of drugs. This situation revealing the limitations of certain experimental models, also results of limitations in clinical research. One of the reasons for the therapeutic difficulties in these patients is probably due to the fact that treatments are used in a uniform fashion whatever the clinical picture, while these syndromes are in fact highly heterogeneous. Clinical advances have recently been made in this field, following the validation of new specific clinical tools and the standardization of quantitative sensory testing paradigms facilitating improvements in the clinical characterization of these syndromes. It has been clearly demonstrated that neuropathic pain is a consistent clinical entity, but it is multidimensional in terms of its clinical expression, with different sensory profiles, potentially reflecting specific pathophysiological mechanisms. This new conceptualization of neuropathic pain should improve the characterization of the responder profiles in clinical trials and provide valuable information for the development of new and more clinically sound translational approaches in experimental models in animals.

In recent years, the delta opioid receptor has attracted increasing interest as a target for the treatment of chronic pain and emotional disorders. Due to their therapeutic potential, numerous tools have been developed to study the delta opioid receptor from both a molecular and a functional perspective. This review summarizes the most commonly available tools, with an emphasis on their use and limitations. Here, we describe (1) the cell-based assays used to study the delta opioid receptor. (2) The features of several delta opioid receptor ligands, including peptide and non-peptide drugs. (3) The existing approaches to detect delta opioid receptors in fixed tissue, and debates that surround these techniques. (4) Behavioral assays used to study the in vivo effects of delta opioid receptor agonists; including locomotor stimulation and convulsions that are induced by some ligands, but not others. (5) The characterization of genetically modified mice used specifically to study the delta opioid receptor. Overall, this review aims to provide a guideline for the use of these tools with the final goal of increasing our understanding of delta opioid receptor physiology.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic pain conditions are multifactorial disorders with a high frequency in the population. Their pathophysiology is often unclear, and treatment is inefficient. During the last 20 years, genetic linkage analysis and association studies have made considerable strides toward identifying key molecular contributors to the onset and maintenance of chronic pain. Here, we review the genetic variants that have been implicated in chronic pain conditions, divided into the following etiologically-grouped categories: migraine, musculoskeletal pain disorders, neuropathic pain disorders, and visceral pain disorders. In rare familial monogenic pain conditions several strong-effect mutations have been identified. In contrast, the genetic landscape of common chronic pain conditions suggests minor contributions from a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms representing different functional pathways. A comprehensive survey of up-to-date genetic association results reveals migraine and musculoskeletal pain to be the most investigated chronic pain disorders, in which nearly half of identified genetic variability alters neurotransmission pathways.

AB  - Abstract
Opioids produce strong analgesia but their use is limited by a paradoxical hypersensitivity named opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH) that may be associated to analgesic tolerance. In the last decades, a significant number of preclinical studies have investigated the factors that modulate OIH development as well as the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying OIH. Several factors have been shown to influence OIH including the genetic background and sex differences of experimental animals as well as the opioid regimen. Mu opioid receptor (MOR) variants and interactions of MOR with different proteins were shown important. Furthermore, at the cellular level, both neurons and glia play a major role in OIH development. Several neuronal processes contribute to OIH, like activation of neuroexcitatory mechanisms, long-term potentiation (LTP) and descending pain facilitation. Increased nociception is also mediated by neuroinflammation induced by the activation of microglia and astrocytes. Neurons and glial cells exert synergistic effects, which contribute to OIH. The molecular actors identified include the Toll-like receptor 4 and the anti-opioid systems as well as some other excitatory molecules, receptors, channels, chemokines, pro-inflammatory cytokines or lipids. This review summarizes the intracellular and intercellular pathways involved in OIH and highlights some mechanisms that may be challenged to limit OIH in the future.

AB  - Abstract
Pain is an ambiguous perception: the same pain stimulation can be perceived differently in different contexts, producing different experiences, ranging from mild to unbearable pain. It can be even experienced as a rewarding sensation within the appropriate context. Overall, placebo and nocebo effects appear to be very good models to understand how the psychosocial context modulates the experience of pain. In this review, we examine the effects of different contexts on pain, with a specific focus on the neurobiological mechanisms. Positive and rewarding contexts inform the patients that an effective treatment is being delivered and are capable of producing pain relief through the activation of specific systems such as opioids, cannabinoids and dopamine. Conversely, a negative context can produce pain exacerbation and clinical worsening through the modulation of different systems, such as the activation of cholecystokinin and the deactivation of opioids and dopamine. In addition, when a therapy is delivered unbeknownst to the patient, its effects are reduced. A better understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of the context–pain interaction is a challenge both for future pain research and for good clinical practice.

AB  - Abstract
This review addresses the fundamental question of how we first experience pain, at the beginning of our lives. The brain is activated by peripheral tissue damaging stimulation from birth, but unlike other sensory systems, the pain system in healthy individuals cannot rely upon prolonged activity-dependent shaping through repeated noxious stimulation. Considering the importance of pain, remarkably little is known about when and how nociceptive cortical network activity characteristic of the mature adult brain develops. We begin this review by considering the underlying framework of connections in the infant brain. Since this developing brain connectome is necessary, if not sufficient, for pain experience, we discuss the structural and functional development of cortical and subcortical networks that contribute to this network. We then review specific information on the development of nociceptive processing in the infant brain, considering evidence from neurophysiological and hemodynamic measures separately, as the two are not always consistent. Finally we highlight areas that require further research and discuss how information gained from laboratory animal models will greatly increase our understanding in this area.

AB  - Abstract
The midbrain dopamine center comprises a key network for reward, salience, motivation, and mood. Evidence from various clinical and preclinical settings points to the midbrain dopamine circuit as an important modulator of pain perception and pain-induced anxiety and depression. This review summarizes recent findings that shed light to the neuroanatomical, electrophysiological and molecular adaptations that chronic pain conditions promote in the mesolimbic dopamine system. Chronic pain states induce changes in neuronal plasticity and functional connectivity in several parts of the brain reward center, including nucleus accumbens, the ventral tegmental area and the prefrontal cortex. Here, we discuss recent findings on the mechanisms involved in the perception of chronic pain, in pain-induced anxiety and depression, as well as in pain-killer addiction vulnerability. Several new studies also show that the mesolimbic dopamine circuit potently modulates responsiveness to opioids and antidepressants used for the treatment of chronic pain. We discuss recent data supporting a role of the brain reward pathway in treatment efficacy and we summarize novel findings on intracellular adaptations in the brain reward circuit under chronic pain states.

The dorsal horn (DH) of the spinal cord receives a variety of sensory information arising from the inner and outer environment, as well as modulatory inputs from supraspinal centers. This information is integrated by the DH before being forwarded to brain areas where it may lead to pain perception. Spinal integration of this information relies on the interplay between different DH neurons forming complex and plastic neuronal networks. Elements of these networks are therefore potential targets for new analgesics and pain-relieving strategies. The present review aims at providing an overview of the current knowledge on these networks, with a special emphasis on those involving interlaminar communication in both physiological and pathological conditions

Recent studies describe sex and gender as critical factors conditioning the experience of pain and the strategies to respond to it. It is now clear that men and women have different physiological and behavioral responses to pain. Some pathological pain states are also highly sex-specific. This clinical observation has been often verified with animal studies which helped to decipher the mechanisms underlying the observed female hyper-reactivity and hyper-sensitivity to pain states. The role of gonadal hormones in the modulation of pain responses has been a straightforward hypothesis but, if pertinent in many cases, cannot fully account for this complex sensation, which includes an important cognitive component. Clinical and fundamental data are reviewed here with a special emphasis on possible developmental processes giving rise to sex-differences in pain processing.

AB  - Abstract
Neuropathic pain arises as a consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system. It is generally chronic and challenging to treat. The recommended pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain includes the use of some antidepressants, such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) (amitriptyline…) or serotonin and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors (duloxetine…), and/or anticonvulsants such as the gabapentinoids gabapentin or pregabalin. Antidepressant drugs are not acute analgesics but require a chronic treatment to relieve neuropathic pain, which suggests the recruitment of secondary downstream mechanisms as well as long-term molecular and neuronal plasticity. Noradrenaline is a major actor for the action of antidepressant drugs in a neuropathic pain context. Mechanistic hypotheses have implied the recruitment of noradrenergic descending pathways as well as the peripheral recruitment of noradrenaline from sympathetic fibers sprouting into dorsal root ganglia; and importance of both α2 and β2 adrenoceptors have been reported. These monoamine re-uptake inhibitors may also indirectly act as anti-proinflammatory cytokine drugs; and their therapeutic action requires the opioid system, particularly the mu (MOP) and/or delta (DOP) opioid receptors. Gabapentinoids, which target the voltage-dependent calcium channels α2δ-1 subunit, inhibit calcium currents, thus decreasing the excitatory transmitter release and spinal sensitization. Gabapentinoids also activate the descending noradrenergic pain inhibitory system coupled to spinal α2 adrenoceptors. Gabapentinoid treatment may also indirectly impact on neuroimmune actors, like proinflammatory cytokines. These drugs are effective against neuropathic pain both with acute administration at high dose and with repeated administration. This review focuses on mechanistic knowledge concerning chronic antidepressant treatment and gabapentinoid treatment in a neuropathic pain context.

AB  - Abstract
Fibromyalgia is the current term for chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain for which no alternative cause can be identified. The underlying mechanisms, in both human and animal studies, for the continued pain in individuals with fibromyalgia will be explored in this review. There is a substantial amount of support for alterations of central nervous system nociceptive processing in people with fibromyalgia, and that psychological factors such as stress can enhance the pain experience. Emerging evidence has begun exploring other potential mechanisms including a peripheral nervous system component to the generation of pain and the role of systemic inflammation. We will explore the data and neurobiology related to the role of the CNS in nociceptive processing, followed by a short review of studies examining potential peripheral nervous system changes and cytokine involvement. We will not only explore the data from human subjects with fibromyalgia but will relate this to findings from animal models of fibromyalgia. We conclude that fibromyalgia and related disorders are heterogenous conditions with a complicated pathobiology with patients falling along a continuum with one end a purely peripherally driven painful condition and the other end of the continuum is when pain is purely centrally driven.

AB  - Abstract
The main focus for the development of adenosine targets as analgesics to date has been A1Rs due to its antinociceptive profile in various preclinical pain models. The usefulness of systemic A1R agonists may be limited by other effects (cardiovascular, motor), but enhanced selectivity for pain might occur with partial agonists, potent and highly selective agonists, or allosteric modulators. A2AR agonists exhibit some peripheral pronociceptive effects, but also act on immune cells to suppress inflammation and on spinal glia to suppress pain signaling and may be useful for inflammatory and neuropathic pain. A2BR agonists exhibit peripheral proinflammatory effects on immune cells, but also spinal antinociceptive effects similar to A2AR agonists. A3Rs are now demonstrated to produce antinociception in several preclinical neuropathic pain models, with mechanistic actions on glial cells, and may be useful for neuropathic pain. Endogenous adenosine levels can be augmented by inhibition of metabolism (via adenosine kinase) or increased generation (via nucleotidases), and these approaches have implications for pain. Endogenous adenosine contributes to antinociception by several pharmacological agents, herbal remedies, acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, exercise, joint mobilization, and water immersion via spinal and/or peripheral effects, such that this system appears to constitute a major pain regulatory system. Finally, caffeine inhibits A1-, A2A- and A3Rs with similar potency, and dietary caffeine intake will need attention in trials of: (a) agonists and/or modulators acting at these receptors, (b) some pharmacological and herbal analgesics, and (c) manipulations that enhance endogenous adenosine levels, all of which are inhibited by caffeine and/or A1R antagonists in preclinical studies. All adenosine receptors have effects on spinal glial cells in regulating nociception, and gender differences in the involvement of such cells in chronic neuropathic pain indicate gender may also need attention in preclinical and human trials evaluating the efficacy of adenosine-based analgesics.

AB  - Abstract
Animal and human studies have consistently demonstrated that cortical regions are important for pain perception and pain-related emotional changes. Studies of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) have shown that adult cortical synapses can be modified after peripheral injuries, and long-term changes at synaptic level may contribute to long-lasting suffering in patients. It also explains why chronic pain is resistant to conventional analgesics that act by inhibiting synaptic transmission. Insular cortex (IC), another critical cortical area, is found to be highly plastic and can undergo long-term potentiation (LTP) after injury. Inhibiting IC LTP reduces behavioral sensitization caused by injury. LTP of glutamatergic transmission in pain related cortical areas serves as a key mechanism for chronic pain.

AB  - Abstract
The noradrenergic system is crucial for several activities in the body, including the modulation of pain. As the major producer of noradrenaline (NA) in the central nervous system (CNS), the Locus Coeruleus (LC) is a nucleus that has been studied in several pain conditions, mostly due to its strategic location. Indeed, apart from a well-known descending LC-spinal pathway that is important for pain control, an ascending pathway passing through this nucleus may be responsible for the noradrenergic inputs to higher centers of the pain processing, such as the limbic system and frontal cortices. Thus, the noradrenergic system appears to modulate different components of the pain experience and accordingly, its manipulation has distinct behavioral outcomes. The main goal of this review is to bring together the data available regarding the noradrenergic system in relation to pain, particularly focusing on the ascending and descending LC projections in different conditions. How such findings influence our understanding of these conditions is also discussed.

AB  - Abstract
We have witnessed an accelerated growth of photonics technologies in recent years to enable not only monitoring the activity of specific neurons, while animals are performing certain types of behavior, but also testing whether specific cells, circuits, and regions are sufficient or necessary for initiating, maintaining, or altering this or that behavior. Compared to other sensory systems, however, such as the visual or olfactory system, photonics applications in pain research are only beginning to emerge. One reason pain studies have lagged behind is that many of the techniques originally developed cannot be directly implemented to study key relay sites within pain pathways, such as the skin, dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord, and brainstem. This is due, in part, to difficulties in accessing these structures with light. Here we review a number of recent advances in design and delivery of light-sensitive molecular probes (sensors and actuators) into pain relay circuits to help decipher their structural and functional organization. We then discuss several challenges that have hampered hardware access to specific structures including light scattering, tissue movement and geometries. We review a number of strategies to circumvent these challenges, by delivering light into, and collecting it from the different key sites to unravel how nociceptive signals are encoded at each level of the neuraxis. We conclude with an outlook on novel imaging modalities for label-free chemical detection and opportunities for multimodal interrogation in vivo. While many challenges remain, these advances offer unprecedented opportunities to bridge cellular approaches with context-relevant behavioral testing, an essential step toward improving translation of basic research findings into clinical applications.

AB  - Abstract
Dominant optic atrophy (DOA) arises from mutations in the OPA1 gene that promotes fusion of the inner mitochondrial membrane and plays a role in maintaining ATP levels. Patients display optic disc pallor, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and bilaterally reduced vision.

We report a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of idebenone at 2000 mg/kg/day in 56 Opa1 mutant mice (B6;C3-Opa1Q285STOP), with RGC dendropathy and visual loss, and 63 wildtype mice. We assessed cellular responses in the retina, brain and liver and RGC morphology, by diolistic labeling, Sholl analysis and quantification of dendritic morphometric features. Vision was assessed by optokinetic responses.

ATP levels were raised by 0.57 nmol/mg (97.73%, p = 0.035) in brain from idebenone-treated Opa1 mutant mice, but in the liver there was an 80.35% (p = 0.011) increase in oxidative damage. NQO1 expression in Opa1 mutant mice was reduced in the brain (to 30.5%, p = 0.002) but not in retina, and neither expression level was induced by idebenone. ON-center RGCs failed to show major recovery, other than improvements in secondary dendritic length (by 53.89%, p = 0.052) and dendritic territory (by 2.22 × 104 μm2 or 90.24%, p = 0.074). An improvement in optokinetic response was observed (by 12.2 ± 3.2 s, p = 0.003), but this effect was not sustained over time. OFF-center RGCs from idebenone-treated wildtype mice showed shrinkage in total dendritic length by 2.40 mm (48.05%, p = 0.025) and a 47.37% diminished Sholl profile (p = 0.029). Visual function in wildtype idebenone-treated mice was impaired (2.9 fewer head turns than placebo, p = 0.007).

Idebenone appears largely ineffective in protecting Opa1 heterozygous RGCs from dendropathy. The detrimental effect of idebenone in wildtype mice has not been previously observed and raises some concerns.

AB  - Abstract
Recently, our group established a relationship between tumor-induced spinal cord astrocyte activation and aromatase expression and the development of bone tumor nociception in male mice. As an extension of this work, we now report on the association of tumor-induced mechanical hyperalgesia and cold hypersensitivity to changes in spinal cord dorsal horn GFAP and aromatase expression in intact (INT) female mice and the effect of ovariectomy on these parameters. Implantation of fibrosarcoma cells produced robust mechanical hyperalgesia in INT animals, while ovariectomized (OVX) females had significantly less mechanical hyperalgesia. Cold hypersensitivity was apparent by post-implantation day 7 in INT and OVX females compared to their saline-injected controls and increased throughout the experiment. The decrease in mechanical hyperalgesia in OVX females was mirrored by significant decreases in spinal astrocyte activity in laminae I-II, III-IV, V-VI and X and aromatase expression in laminae V-VI and X in the dorsal horn of tumor-bearing animals. Administration of the aromatase inhibitor letrozole reduced tumor-induced hyperalgesia in INT females only suggesting that the tumor-induced increase in aromatase expression and its associated increase in spinal estrogen play a role in the development of bone tumor-induced hyperalgesia. Finally, intrathecal (i.t.) administration of 17β-estradiol caused a significant increase in tumor-induced hyperalgesia in INT tumor-bearing females. Since i.t. 17β-estradiol increases tumor pain and ovariectomy significantly decreases tumor pain, as well as spinal aromatase, estrogen may play a critical role in the spinal cord response to the changing tumor environment and the development of tumor-induced nociception.

AB  - Abstract
Since the discovery of the role of the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease, UPS inhibitors, such as lactacystin have been used to investigate the relationship between UPS impairment and degeneration of dopamine (DA) neurons. However, mostly long-term neurotoxic effects of lactacystin have been studied in animal models. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate behavioral and biochemical changes related to the DA system during the first week following unilateral intranigral injection of lactacystin to rats. We found that lactacystin produced early spontaneous contralateral rotations which were inhibited by combined administration of DA D1 and D2 receptor antagonists. Simultaneously, an increase in the extracellular level of DA and its metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanilic acid (HVA) was found in the ipsilateral striatum. In contrast, one week after lesion, when turning behavior was no longer visible, a decrease in the extracellular level of DA, DOPAC and HVA was demonstrated. It was accompanied by a substantial reduction in the tissue levels of DA and its metabolites in the lesioned substantia nigra and striatum. We concluded that unilateral intranigral administration of lactacystin produces an early increase in DA neurotransmission which precedes a decrease in the striatal and nigral tissue DA content. It is manifested by the appearance of spontaneous contralateral rotations and an elevation of the extracellular DA level in the ipsilateral striatum. Since similar behavior was previously observed after intranigral administration of rotenone and MPP+ but not 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), it may indicate a common mechanism of action shared by these neurotoxins.

AB  - Abstract
κ opioid receptor agonists produce aversive effects in rodents, however the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) has been discovered to play a critical role in the modulation of affective behaviors. The present study was undertaken to detect the possible involvement of p38 MAPK in the aversive effects induced by κ opioid receptor activation. We found that the κ opioid receptor agonist trans-(±)-3,4-Dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl]benzenacetamide methanesulfonate salt (U50,488H) produced significant place aversion in mice as measured by the conditioned place preference procedure, accompanied with significant p38 MAPK activation in the amygdala, but not in the nucleus accumbens and hippocampus. Stereotaxic microinjection of the p38 MAPK inhibitor 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridy-l)-1H-imidazole (SB203580) into amygdala significantly inhibited p38 MAPK activation and completely blocked the conditioned place aversion in mice. Thus, these results suggested that activation of p38 MAPK in the amygdala was required to mediate κ opioid receptor-induced aversive behavior.

Astrocytes are now recognized as key players in the neurobiology of neurodevelopmental disorders such as Fragile X syndrome. However, the nature of Fragile X astrocyte-mediated control of dendrite development in subtypes of hippocampal neurons is not yet known. We used a co-culture procedure in which wildtype primary hippocampal neurons were cultured with astrocytes from either a wildtype or Fragile X mouse, for either 7, 14 or 21 days. The neurons were processed for immunocytochemistry with the dendritic marker MAP2, classified by morphological criteria into one of five neuronal subtypes, and subjected to Sholl analyses. Both linear and semi-log methods of Sholl analyses were applied to the neurons in order to provide an in depth analysis of the dendritic arborizations. We found that Fragile X astrocytes affect the development of dendritic arborization of all subtypes of wildtype hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, we show that hippocampal neurons with spiny stellate neuron morphology exhibit the most pervasive developmental delays, with significant dendritic arbor alterations persisting at 21 days in culture. The results further dictate the critical role astrocytes play in governing neuronal morphology including altered dendrite development in Fragile X.

AB  - Abstract
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) obtained from bone marrow (BM) have been shown to promote neuronal growth and survival. However, the comparative effects of MSCs of different sources, including menstrual MSCs (MenSCs), BM, umbilical cord and chorion stem cells on neurite outgrowth have not yet been explored. Moreover, the modulatory effects of MSCs may be mediated by paracrine mechanisms, i.e. by molecules contained in the MSC secretome that includes soluble factors and extracellular vesicles such as microvesicles and/or exosomes. The biogenesis of microvesicles, characterized by a vesicle diameter of 50 to 1000 nm, involves membrane shedding while exosomes, of 30 to 100 nm in diameter, originate in the multivesicular bodies within cells. Both vesicle types, which can be harvested from the conditioned media of cell cultures by differential centrifugation steps, regulate the function of target cells due to their molecular content of microRNA, mRNA, proteins and lipids. Here, we compared the effect of human menstrual MSCs (MenSCs) mediated by cell–cell contact, by their total secretome or by secretome-derived extracellular vesicles on neuritic outgrowth in primary neuronal cultures. The contact of MenSCs with cortical neurons inhibited neurite outgrowth while their total secretome enhanced it. The extracellular vesicle fractions showed a distinctive effect: while the exosome-enriched fraction enhanced neurite outgrowth, the microvesicle-enriched fraction displayed an inhibitory effect. When we compared exosome fractions of different human MSC sources, MenSC exosomes showed superior effects on the growth of the longest neurite in cortical neurons and had a comparable effect to BM-SC exosomes on neurite outgrowth in dorsal root ganglia neurons. Thus, the growth-stimulating effects of exosomes derived from MenSCs as well as the opposing effects of both extracellular vesicle fractions provide important information regarding the potential use of MenSCs as therapeutic conveyors in neurodegenerative pathologies.

AB  - Abstract
One common feature of most neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and stroke, is the death of neuronal cells. Neuronal cell death is associated with apoptosis, generation of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress. Neuronal cell death pathways can be reversed by endothelin B receptor agonist, IRL-1620, which was found to enhance neuroprotection by promoting vascular and neuronal growth in a rodent stroke model. Previous studies conducted at our institution indicated that the treatment with IRL-1620 significantly improved neurological and motor function while reducing oxidative stress and overall infarct area. IRL-1620 is a hydrophilic, 15 amino acid peptide and has a molecular weight of 1820 Da. In this study, we have encapsulated IRL-1620 in PEGylated liposomes in order to enhance its efficacy. Each batch of liposomes encapsulating IRL-1620 was evaluated for particle size, polydispersity index, and charge (zeta potential) over a period of time to determine their stability. A dose–response bar graph was plotted based on the effect of neuroprotection by free IRL-1620 on differentiated neuronal PC-12 cells. The 1 nM concentration was found to have the highest cell viability. The liposomes loaded with IRL-1620 were tested on differentiated neuronal PC-12 cells for their neuroprotective ability against apoptosis caused by removal of nerve growth factor (NGF) against free (non-encapsulated) IRL-1620. The liposomal IRL-1620 was found to proliferate the growth of serum-deprived differentiated PC-12 cells significantly (p &lt; 0.0001). In the western blot analysis, the expression of the anti-apoptotic marker, BCL-2 was found to be increased, and that of pro-apoptotic marker, BAX was found to be decreased with liposomal IRL-1620. The effects were found to be independent of the NGF levels. Finally the free IRL-1620 was found to cause neuronal outgrowth equivalent to the 75 ng/ml NGF treatment.

AB  - Abstract
The choroid plexus (CP) located in brain ventricles, by forming the interface between the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is in a privileged position to monitor the composition of these body fluids. Yet, the mechanisms involved in this surveillance system remain to be identified. The taste transduction pathway senses some types of molecules, thereby evaluating the chemical content of fluids, not only in the oral cavity but also in other tissues throughout the body, such as some cell types of the airways, the gastrointestinal tract, testis and skin. Therefore, we hypothesized that the taste transduction pathway could also be operating in the CP to assess the composition of the CSF. We found transcripts for some taste receptors (Tas1r1, Tas1r2, Tas1r3, Tas2r109 and Tas2r144) and for downstream signaling molecules (α-Gustducin, Plcβ2, ItpR3 and TrpM5) that encode this pathway, and confirmed the expression of the corresponding proteins in Wistar rat CP explants and in the CP epithelial cells (CPEC). The functionality of the T2R receptor expressed in CP cells was assessed by calcium imaging, of CPEC stimulated with the bitter compound d-Salicin, which elicited a rise in the intracellular Ca2+. This effect was diminished in the presence of the bitter receptor blocker Probenecid. In summary, we described the expression of the taste-related components involved in the transduction signaling cascade in CP. Taken together, our results suggest that the taste transduction pathway in CPEC makes use of T2R receptors in the chemical surveillance of the CSF composition, in particular to sense bitter noxious compounds.

AB  - Abstract
Brain plays a central role in energy homeostasis continuously integrating numerous peripheral signals such as circulating nutrients, and in particular blood glucose level, a variable that must be highly regulated. Then, the brain orchestrates adaptive responses to modulate food intake and peripheral organs activity in order to achieve the fine tuning of glycemia. More than fifty years ago, the presence of glucose-sensitive neurons was discovered in the hypothalamus, but what makes them specific and identifiable still remains disconnected from their electrophysiological signature. On the other hand, astrocytes represent the major class of macroglial cells and are now recognized to support an increasing number of neuronal functions. One of these functions consists in the regulation of energy homeostasis through neuronal fueling and nutrient sensing. Twenty years ago, we discovered that the glucose transporter GLUT2, the canonical “glucosensor” of the pancreatic beta-cell together with the glucokinase, was also present in astrocytes and participated in hypothalamic glucose sensing. Since then, many studies have identified other actors and emphasized the astroglial participation in this mechanism. Growing evidence suggest that astrocytes form a complex network and have to be considered as spatially coordinated and regulated metabolic units. In this review we aim to provide an updated view of the molecular and respective cellular pathways involved in hypothalamic glucose sensing, and their relevance in physiological and pathological states.

AB  - Abstract
In the brain, astrocytes occupy a key position between vessels and synapses. Among their numerous functions, these glial cells are key partners of neurons during synaptic transmission. Astrocytes detect transmitter release through receptors and transporters at the level of their processes, which are in close proximity to the tow neuronal elements of synapses. In response to transmitter-mediated activation, glial cells in turn regulate synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. This process has been reported to involve several glial receptors. One of the best known of such receptors is the metabotropic glutamatergic receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5). In the present review we will discuss the implication of mGluR5s as detectors of synaptic transmission. In particular, we will discuss how the functional properties and localization of these receptors permit the detection of the synaptic signal in a defined temporal window and a given spatial area around the synapse. Furthermore, we will review the impact of their activation on synaptic transmission.

AB  - Abstract
Nitroglycerin (glycerol trinitrate, GTN) induces headache in migraineurs, an effect that has been used both diagnostically and in the study of the pathophysiology of this neurovascular pain syndrome. An important feature of this headache is a delay from the administration of GTN to headache onset that, because of GTN’s very rapid metabolism, cannot be due to its pharmacokinetic profile. It has recently been suggested that activation of perivascular mast cells, which has been implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine, may contribute to this delay. We reported that hyperalgesia induced by intradermal GTN has a delay to onset of ∼30 min in male and ∼45 min in female rats. This hyperalgesia was greater in females, was prevented by pretreatment with the anti-migraine drug, sumatriptan, as well as by chronic pretreatment with the mast cell degranulator, compound 48/80. The acute administration of GTN and compound 48/80 both induced hyperalgesia that was prevented by pretreatment with octoxynol-9, which attenuates endothelial function, suggesting that GTN and mast cell-mediated hyperalgesia are endothelial cell-dependent. Furthermore, A-317491, a P2X3 antagonist, which inhibits endothelial cell-dependent hyperalgesia, also prevents GTN and mast cell-mediated hyperalgesia. We conclude that delayed-onset mechanical hyperalgesia induced by GTN is mediated by activation of mast cells, which in turn release mediators that stimulate endothelial cells to release ATP, to act on P2X3, a ligand-gated ion channel, in perivascular nociceptors. A role of the mast and endothelial cell in GTN-induced hyperalgesia suggests potential novel risk factors and targets for the treatment of migraine.

AB  - Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common causes of dementia. Although the exact mechanisms of AD are not entirely clear, the impairment in adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been reported to play a role in AD. To assess the relationship between AD and neurogenesis, we studied APP/PS1/nestin-green fluorescent protein (GFP) triple transgenic mice, a well-characterized mouse model of AD, which express GFP under the control of the nestin promoter. Different ages of AD mice and their wild-type littermates (WT) were used in our study. Immunofluorescent staining showed that neurogenesis occurred mainly in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG) and subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles (LVs). The expression of neural stem cells (NSCs) (nestin) and neural precursors such as doublecortin (DCX) and GFAP in AD mice were decreased with age, as well as there being a reduction in 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells, when compared to WT. However, the number of maturate neurons (NeuN) was not significantly different between AD mice and wild-type controls, and NeuN changed only slightly with age. By Golgi–Cox staining, the morphologies of dendrites were observed, and significant differences existed between AD mice and wild-type controls. These results suggest that AD has a far-reaching influence on the regulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis, leading to a gradual decrease in the generation of neural progenitors (NPCs), and inhibition of the differentiation and maturation of neurons.

AB  - Abstract
cAMP response-element binding protein (CREB)-dependent genes are differentially expressed in brains of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients and also in animal models of TLE. Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of CREB regulated transcription in TLE. However, the role of the key regulator of CREB activity, CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 1 (CRTC1), has not been explored in epilepsy. In the present study the pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) model of TLE was used to study the regulation of CRTC1 during and following SE. Nuclear translocation of CRTC1 is critical for its transcriptional activity, and dephosphorylation at serine 151 residue via calcineurin phosphatase regulates cytoplasmic to nuclear transit of CRTC1. Here, we examined the localization and phosphorylation (Ser151) of CRTC1 in SE-induced rat hippocampus at two different time points after SE onset.

One hour after SE onset, we found that CRTC1 translocates to the nucleus of CA1 neurons but not CA3 or dentate granule neurons. We further found that this CRTC1 nuclear localization is independent of Ser151 dephosphorylation since we did not detect any difference in dephosphorylation of Ser151 between control and SE animals at this time point.

In contrast, 48 h after SE CRTC1 shows increased nuclear localization in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the SE-induced rats. At 48 h after SE, FK506 treatment blocked CRTC1 nuclear localization and dephosphorylation of Ser151.

Our results provide evidence that CREB cofactor CRTC1 translocates into the nucleus of a distinct subset of hippocampal neurons during and following SE and this translocalization is regulated by calcineurin at a later time point following SE. Nuclear CRTC1 can bind to CREB possibly altering transcription during epileptogenesis.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic stress has a detrimental effect on neurological insults, psychiatric deficits, and cognitive impairment. In the current study, chronic stress was shown to impair learning and memory functions, in addition to reducing in hippocampal Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity. Similar reductions were also observed for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), synaptophysin, and post-synaptic density-95 (PSD-95) levels, all of which was counter-regulated by a regime of regular and prolonged exercise. A 21-day restraint stress regimen (6 h/day) produced learning and memory deficits, including reduced alternation in the Y-maze and decreased memory retention in the water maze test. These effects were reversed post-administration by a 3-week regime of treadmill running (19 m/min, 1 h/day, 6 days/week). In hippocampal primary culture, phosphorylated-AMPK (phospho-AMPK) and BDNF levels were enhanced in a dose-dependent manner by 5-amimoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (AICAR) treatment, and AICAR-treated increase was blocked by Compound C. A 7-day period of AICAR intraperitoneal injections enhanced alternation in the Y-maze test and reduced escape latency in water maze test, along with enhanced phospho-AMPK and BDNF levels in the hippocampus. The intraperitoneal injection of Compound C every 4 days during exercise intervention diminished exercise-induced enhancement of memory improvement during the water maze test in chronically stressed mice. Also, chronic stress reduced hippocampal neurogenesis (lower Ki-67- and doublecortin-positive cells) and mRNA levels of BDNF, synaptophysin, and PSD-95. Our results suggest that regular and prolonged exercise can alleviate chronic stress-induced hippocampal-dependent memory deficits. Hippocampal AMPK-engaged BDNF induction is at least in part required for exercise-induced protection against chronic stress.

While the regulation of the neurogenesis and oligodendrogenesis by microRNAs has been intensively studied, little is known about the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the development of astrocytes. Here, we report that microRNAs play an essential role in the differentiation and maturation of white matter astrocytes in mouse spinal cord tissues. In glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)/Dicer conditional mutants, the initial generation of astrocyte progenitor cells was normal in the spinal cord. However, there was a much reduced number of GFAP+ astrocytes with shorter processes in the white matter of mutant tissues. In contrast, the expression of gray matter protoplasmic astrocyte marker was not affected. Together, our studies indicated that miRNAs are required for the differentiation and morphological maturation of white matter fibrous astrocytes in the developing spinal cord.

AB  - Abstract
Maternal consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) during pregnancy is found to stimulate the genesis of hypothalamic orexigenic peptide neurons in the offspring, while HFD intake in adult animals produces a systemic low-grade inflammation which increases neuroimmune factors that may affect neurogenesis and neuronal migration. Building on this evidence and our recent study showing that the inflammatory chemokine, CCL2, stimulates the migration of hypothalamic neurons and expression of orexigenic neuropeptides, we tested here the possibility that prenatal exposure to a HFD in rats affects this chemokine system, both CCL2 and its receptors, CCR2 and CCR4, and alters its actions on hypothalamic neurons, specifically those expressing the neuropeptides, enkephalin (ENK) and galanin (GAL). Using primary dissociated hypothalamic neurons extracted from embryos on embryonic day 19, we found that prenatal HFD exposure compared to chow control actually reduces the expression of CCL2 in these hypothalamic neurons, while increasing CCR2 and CCR4 expression, and also reduces the sensitivity of hypothalamic neurons to CCL2. The HFD abolished the dose-dependent, stimulatory effect of CCL2 on the number of migrated neurons and even shifted its normal stimulatory effect on migrational velocity and distance traveled by control neurons to an inhibition of migration. Further, it abolished the dose-dependent, stimulatory effect of CCL2 on neuronal expression of ENK and GAL. These results demonstrate that prenatal HFD exposure greatly disturbs the functioning of the CCL2 chemokine system in embryonic hypothalamic neurons, reducing its endogenous levels and ability to promote the migration of neurons and their expression of orexigenic peptides.

The World Health Organization has predicted that by 2040 neurodegenerative diseases will overtake cancer to become the world’s second leading cause of death after cardiovascular disease. This has sparked the development of several European and American brain research initiatives focusing on elucidating the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases. Connexin (Cx) and pannexin (Panx) membrane channel proteins are conduits through which neuronal, glial, and vascular tissues interact. In the brain, this interaction is highly critical for homeostasis and brain repair after injury. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which these membrane channels function, in health and disease, might be particularly influential in establishing conceptual frameworks to develop new therapeutics against Cx and Panx channels. This review focuses on current insights and emerging concepts, particularly the impact of connexin43 and pannexin1, under neuroprotective and neurodegenerative conditions within the context of astrocytes.

AB  - Abstract
Monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) are involved in lactate trafficking and utilization by brain cells. As lactate is not only overproduced during ischemia but its utilization was shown to be essential upon recovery, we analyzed the expression of the main cerebral MCTs at 1 and 24 h after an ischemic insult induced by a transient occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCAO) in CD1 mice (n = 5, 7 and 10 for control, 1 and 24 h groups, respectively). After 1 h of reperfusion, an upregulation of the three MCTs was observed in the striatum (MCT1 ipsilateral 2.73 ± 0.2 and contralateral 2.01 ± 0.4; MCT2 ipsilateral 2.1 ± 0.1; MCT4 ipsilateral 1.65 ± 0.1) and in the surrounding cortex of both the ipsilateral (MCT1 2.4 ± 0.4; MCT2 1.62 ± 0.2; MCT4 1.31 ± 0.1) and contralateral (MCT1 2.78 ± 0.4; MCT2 1.76 ± 0.2) hemispheres, compared to the corresponding sham hemispheres. An increase of MCT1 (ipsilateral 2.1 ± 0.2) and MCT2 (contralateral 1.9 ± 0.1) expression was also observed in the hippocampus, while no effect was observed for MCT4. At 24 h of reperfusion, total MCT2 and MCT4 expressions were decreased in the striatum (MCT2 ipsilateral 0.32 ± 0.1 and contralateral 0.63 ± 0.1; MCT4 ipsilateral 0.59 ± 0.1) and the surrounding cortex (MCT4 ipsilateral 0.67 ± 0.1), compared to the sham. At the cellular level, neurons which usually express only MCT2 strongly expressed MCT1 at both time points. Surprisingly, staining for MCT4 appeared on neurons and was strong at 24 h post-insult, in the striatum and the cortex of both hemispheres. A similar expression pattern was observed also in the ipsilateral hemisphere of the sham operated animals at 24 h. Overall, our study indicates that cell-specific changes in MCT expression induced by an ischemic insult may participate to the metabolic adaptations taking place in the brain after a transient ischemic episode.

AB  - Abstract
The aim was to investigate urodynamic parameters and functional excitability of the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) during changes in sleep-like brain states in urethane anesthetized rats. Simultaneous recordings of detrusor pressure, external urethral sphincter (EUS) electromyogram (EMG), cortical electroencephalogram (EEG), and single-unit activity in the PAG were made during repeated voiding induced by continuous infusion of saline into the bladder.

The EEG cycled between synchronized, high-amplitude slow wave activity (SWA) and desynchronized low-amplitude fast activity similar to slow wave and ‘activated’ sleep-like brain states. During (SWA, 0.5–1.5 Hz synchronized oscillation of the EEG waveform) voiding became more irregular than in the ‘activated’ brain state (2–5 Hz low-amplitude desynchronized EEG waveform) and detrusor void pressure threshold, void volume threshold and the duration of bursting activity in the external urethral sphincter EMG were raised. The spontaneous firing rate of 23/52 neurons recorded within the caudal PAG and adjacent tegmentum was linked to the EEG state, with the majority of responsive cells (92%) firing more slowly during SWA. Almost a quarter of the cells recorded (12/52) showed phasic changes in firing rate that were linked to the occurrence of voids. Inhibition (n = 6), excitation (n = 4) or excitation/inhibition (n = 2) was seen. The spontaneous firing rate of 83% of the micturition-responsive cells was sensitive to changes in EEG state. In nine of the 12 responsive cells (75%) the responses were reduced during SWA.

We propose that during different sleep-like brain states changes in urodynamic properties occur which may be linked to changing excitability of the micturition circuitry in the periaqueductal gray.

Human bipedal balance control is achieved either reactively or predictively by a distributed network of neural areas within the central nervous system with a potential role for cerebral cortex. While the role of the cortex in reactive balance has been widely explored, only few studies have addressed the cortical activations related to predictive balance control. The present study investigated the cortical activations related to the preparation and execution of anticipatory postural adjustment (APA) that precede a step. This study also examined whether the preparatory cortical activations related to a specific movement is dependent on the context of control (postural component vs. focal component). Ground reaction forces and electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded from 14 healthy adults while they performed lateral weight shift and lateral stepping with and without initially preloading their weight to the stance leg. EEG analysis revealed that there were distinct movement-related potentials (MRPs) with concurrent event-related desynchronization (ERD) of mu and beta rhythms prior to the onset of APA and also to the onset of foot-off during lateral stepping in the fronto-central cortical areas. Also, the MRPs and ERD prior to the onset of APA and onset of lateral weight shift were not significantly different suggesting the comparable cortical activations for the generation of postural and focal movements. The present study reveals the occurrence of cortical activation prior to the execution of an APA that precedes a step. Importantly, this cortical activity appears independent of the context of the movement.

AB  - Abstract
Prenatal stress and overexposure to glucocorticoids (GC) during development may be associated with an increased susceptibility to a number of diseases in adulthood including neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety. In animal models, prenatal overexposure to GC results in hyper-responsiveness to stress in adulthood, and females appear to be more susceptible than males. Here, we tested the hypothesis that overexposure to GC during fetal development has sex-specific programming effects on the brain, resulting in altered behaviors in adulthood. We examined the effects of dexamethasone (DEX; a synthetic GC) during prenatal life on stress-related behaviors in adulthood and on the tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TpH2) gene expression in the adult dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). TpH2 is the rate-limiting enzyme for serotonin (5-HT) synthesis and has been implicated in the etiology of human affective disorders. Timed-pregnant rats were treated with DEX from gestational days 18–22. Male and female offspring were sacrificed on the day of birth (postnatal day 0; P0), P7, and in adulthood (P80–84) and brains were examined for changes in TpH2 mRNA expression. Adult animals were also tested for anxiety- and depressive- like behaviors. In adulthood, prenatal DEX increased anxiety- and depressive- like behaviors selectively in females, as measured by decreased time spent in the center of the open field and increased time spent immobile in the forced swim test, respectively. Prenatal DEX increased TpH2 mRNA selectively in the female caudal DRN at P7, whereas it decreased TpH2 mRNA selectively in the female caudal DRN in adulthood. In animals challenged with restraint stress in adulthood, TpH2 mRNA was significantly lower in rostral DRN of prenatal DEX-treated females compared to vehicle-treated females. These data demonstrated that prenatal overexposure to GC alters the development of TpH2 gene expression and these alterations correlated with lasting behavioral changes found in adult female offspring.

AB  - Abstract
Women of child-bearing age are the population group at highest risk for depression. In pregnant women, fluoxetine (Flx) is the most widely prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used for the treatment of depression. While maternal stress, depression, and Flx exposure have been shown to effect neurodevelopment of the offspring, separately, combined effects of maternal stress and Flx exposure have not been extensively examined. The present study investigated the effects of prenatal maternal stress and perinatal exposure to the SSRI Flx on the behavior of male mice as adults. METHODS: C57BL/6 dams exposed to chronic unpredictable stress from embryonic (E) day 4 to E18 and non-stressed dams were administered Flx (25 mg/kg/d) in the drinking water from E15 to postnatal day 12. A separate control group consisted of animals that were not exposed to stress or Flx. At 12 days of age, brain levels of serotonin were assessed in the male offspring. At two months of age, the male offspring of mothers exposed to prenatal stress (PS), perinatal Flx, PS and Flx, or neither PS or Flx, went through a comprehensive behavioral test battery. At the end of testing brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) levels were assessed in the frontal cortex of the offspring. Results: Maternal behavior was not altered by either stress or Flx treatment. Treatment of the mother with Flx led to detectible Flx and NorFlx levels and lead to a decrease in serotonin levels in pup brains. In the adult male offspring, while perinatal exposure to Flx increased aggressive behavior, prenatal maternal stress decreased aggressive behavior. Interestingly, the combined effects of stress and Flx normalized aggressive behavior. Furthermore, perinatal Flx treatment led to a decrease in anxiety-like behavior in male offspring. PS led to hyperactivity and a decrease in BDNF levels in the frontal cortex regardless of Flx exposure. Neither maternal stress or Flx altered offspring performance in tests of cognitive abilities, memory, sensorimotor information processing, or risk assessment behaviors. These results demonstrate that maternal exposure to stress and Flx have a number of sustained effects on the male offspring.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic psychosocial stress is an important environmental risk factor for the development of psychiatric diseases. However, studying the impact of chronic psychosocial stress in mice is time consuming and thus not optimally suited to ‘screen’ increasing numbers of genetically manipulated mouse models for psychiatric endophenotypes. Moreover, many studies focus on restraint stress, a strong physical stressor with limited relevance for psychiatric disorders. Here, we describe a simple and a rapid method based on the resident–intruder paradigm to examine acute effects of mild psychosocial stress in mice. The OSO paradigm (open field – social defeat – open field) compares behavioral consequences on locomotor activity, anxiety and curiosity before and after exposure to acute social defeat stress. We first evaluated OSO in male C57Bl/6 wildtype mice where a single episode of social defeat reduced locomotor activity, increased anxiety and diminished exploratory behavior. Subsequently, we applied the OSO paradigm to mouse models of two schizophrenia (SZ) risk genes. Transgenic mice with neuronal overexpression of Neuregulin-1 (Nrg1) type III showed increased risk-taking behavior after acute stress exposure suggesting that NRG1 dysfunction is associated with altered affective behavior. In contrast, Tcf4 transgenic mice displayed a normal stress response which is in line with the postulated predominant contribution of TCF4 to cognitive deficits of SZ. In conclusion, the OSO paradigm allows for rapid screening of selected psychosocial stress-induced behavioral endophenotypes in mouse models of psychiatric diseases.

AB  - Abstract
Animals change their biological activities depending on their nutritional state. Reproductive functions, including sexual behavior, are suppressed under low-energy conditions; however, the underlying neuronal mechanism is poorly understood. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an orexigenic molecule released in response to low-energy conditions and has an inhibitory effect on sexual behavior. We examined how NPY is involved in energy state-dependent regulation of male sexual behavior. Mounting, intromission, and ejaculation were evaluated as parameters of sexual behavior. Almost all parameters indicated that fasting for 24 h suppressed male sexual behavior. Intracerebroventricular injection of NPY inhibited sexual behavior in males that free-fed for 8 h following 24-h fasting (fed males). We next examined whether the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), in which serotonergic (5-HT) neurons are distributed, is involved in NPY-mediated inhibition of male sexual behavior. NPY-positive processes immunoreactive for a presynaptic marker, synaptophysin, were distributed in the DRN of both fed and fasted males. Expression of the NPY Y1 receptor in 5-HT neurons was also observed. Direct injection of NPY or 8-OH-DPAT (a 5-HT1A receptor agonist that inhibits the activity of 5-HT neurons) into the DRN inhibited male sexual behavior in fed males. In contrast, injection of BIBP-3226, a NPY Y1 receptor antagonist, or (+)-DOI hydrochloride (DOI), a 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonist that activates 5-HT neurons, into the DRN partially recovered male sexual behavior in 24-h fasted males. These results suggest that NPY inhibits serotonergic neuronal activity via the Y1 receptor in the DRN, resulting in suppression of male sexual behavior in low-energy conditions.

AB  - Abstract
Engrailed-2 (En2), a homeodomain transcription factor involved in regionalization and patterning of the midbrain and hindbrain regions has been associated to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). En2 knockout (En2−/−) mice show ASD-like features accompanied by a significant loss of GABAergic subpopulations in the hippocampus and neocortex. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a crucial factor for the postnatal development of forebrain GABAergic neurons, and altered GABA signaling has been hypothesized to underlie the symptoms of ASD. Here we sought to determine whether interneuron loss in the En2−/− forebrain might be related to altered expression of BDNF and its signaling receptors. We first evaluated the expression of different BDNF mRNA isoforms in the neocortex and hippocampus of wild-type (WT) and En2−/− mice. Quantitative RT-PCR showed a marked down-regulation of several splicing variants of BDNF mRNA in the neocortex but not hippocampus of adult En2−/− mice, as compared to WT controls. Accordingly, levels of mature BDNF protein were lower in the neocortex but not hippocampus of En2−/− mice, as compared to WT. Increased levels of phosphorylated TrkB and decreased levels of p75 receptor were also detected in the neocortex of mutant mice. Accordingly, the expression of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and RhoA, two genes regulated via p75 was significantly altered in forebrain areas of mutant mice. These data indicate that BDNF signaling alterations might be involved in the anatomical changes observed in the En2−/− forebrain and suggest a pathogenic role of altered BDNF signaling in this mouse model of ASD.

AB  - Abstract
Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is an important complication following major surgery and general anesthesia in older patients. However, the etiology of POCD remains largely to be determined. It is unknown how surgical stress and psychological stress affect the postoperative learning and memory function in geriatric patients. We therefore established a pre-clinical model in aged C57BL/6 mice and aimed to investigate the effects of surgical stress and psychological stress on learning and memory function and the possible roles of the protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (AKT/mTOR) pathway. The surgical stress was induced by abdominal surgery under local anesthesia, and the psychological stress was induced by a communication box. Cognitive functions and markers of the AKT/mTOR pathway were assessed at 1, 3 and 7 days following the stress. The impairments of learning and memory function existed for up to 7 days following surgical stress and surgical stress plus psychological stress, whereas the psychological stress did not affect the cognitive function alone or combined with surgical stress. Analysis of brain tissue revealed a significant involvement of the AKT/mTOR pathway in the impairment of cognition. These data suggested that surgical stress could induce cognitive impairment in aged mice and perioperative psychological stress is not a constitutive factor of POCD. The AKT/mTOR pathway is likely involved as one of the underlying mechanisms of the development of POCD.

AB  - Abstract
Objective: This cross-sectional study evaluated event-related potentials (ERPs) across three groups: naïve, novice, and experienced meditators as potential physiological markers of mindfulness meditation competence. Methods: Electroencephalographic (EEG) data were collected during a target tone detection task and a Breath Counting task. The Breath Counting task served as the mindfulness meditation condition for the novice and experienced meditator groups. Participants were instructed to respond to target tones with a button press in the first task (Tones), and then ignore the primed tones while Breath Counting. The primary outcomes were ERP responses to target tones, namely the N2 and P3, as markers of stimulus discrimination and attention, respectively. Results: As expected, P3 amplitudes elicited by target tones were attenuated within groups during the Breath Counting task in comparison to the Tones task (p &lt; .001). There was a task by group interaction for P3 (p = .039). Both meditator groups displayed greater change in peak-to-trough P3 amplitudes, with higher amplitudes during the Tones condition and more pronounced reductions in P3 amplitudes during the Breath Counting meditation task in comparison to the naïve group. Conclusions: Meditators had stronger P3 amplitude responses to target tones when instructed to attend to the tones, and a greater attenuation of P3 amplitudes when instructed to ignore the same tones during the Breath Counting task. This study introduces the idea of identifying ERP markers as a means of measuring mindfulness meditation competence, and results suggest this may be a valid approach. This information has the potential to improve mindfulness meditation interventions by allowing objective assessment of mindfulness meditation quality.

AB  - Abstract
Large conductance voltage and calcium-activated potassium (MaxiK) channels are activated by membrane depolarization and elevated cytosolic Ca2+. In the brain, they localize to neurons and astrocytes, where they play roles such as resetting the membrane potential during an action potential, neurotransmitter release, and neurovascular coupling. MaxiK channels are known to associate with several modulatory proteins and accessory subunits, and each of these interactions can have distinct physiological consequences. To uncover new players in MaxiK channel brain physiology, we applied a directed proteomic approach and obtained MaxiK channel pore-forming α subunit brain interactome using specific antibodies. Controls included immunoprecipitations with rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) and with anti-MaxiK antibodies in wild type and MaxiK channel knockout mice (Kcnma1−/−), respectively. We have found known and unreported interactive partners that localize to the plasma membrane, extracellular space, cytosol and intracellular organelles including mitochondria, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Localization of MaxiK channel to mitochondria was further confirmed using purified brain mitochondria colabeled with MitoTracker. Independent proof of MaxiK channel interaction with previously unidentified partners is given for GABA transporter 3 (GAT3) and heat shock protein 60 (HSP60). In human embryonic kidney 293 cells containing SV40 T-antigen (HEK293T) cells, both GAT3 and HSP60 coimmunoprecipitated and colocalized with MaxiK channel; colabeling was observed mainly at the cell periphery with GAT3 and intracellularly with HSP60 with protein proximity indices of ∼0.6 and ∼0.4, respectively. In rat primary hippocampal neurons, colocalization index was identical for GAT3 (∼0.6) and slightly higher for HSP60 (∼0.5) association with MaxiK channel. The results of this study provide a complete interactome of MaxiK channel the mouse brain, further establish the localization of MaxiK channel in the mouse brain mitochondria and demonstrate the interaction of MaxiK channel with GAT3 and HSP60 in neurons. The interaction of MaxiK channel with GAT3 opens the possibility of a role of MaxiK channel in GABA homeostasis and signaling.

AB  - Abstract
Activation of P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), a purinergic receptor, expressed by neurons is well-known to induce their death, but whether or not their sensitivity to ATP depends on its expression levels remains unclear. Here, we examined the effect of the expression level of P2X7Rs on cell viability using pure neuron cultures, co-cultures with astrocytes derived from SJL- and ddY-strain mice, and mouse P2X7R-expressing HEK293T cell systems. Treatment of pure neuron cultures with 5 mM ATP for 2 h, followed by 3-h incubation in fresh medium, resulted in death of both types of neurons, and their death was prevented by administration of P2X7R-specific antagonists. In both SJL- and ddY-neurons, ATP-induced neuronal death was inhibited by a mitochondrial permeability transition pore inhibitor cyclosporine A, mitochondrial dysfunction being involved in their death. The ATP-induced neuronal death was greater for SJL-neurons than for ddY-ones, this being correlated with the expression level of P2X7R in them, and the same results were obtained for the HEK293T cell systems. Co-culture of neurons with astrocytes increased the ATP-induced neuronal death compared to the case of pure neuron cultures. Overall, we reveal that neuronal vulnerability to ATP depends on the expression level of P2X7R, and co-existence of astrocytes exacerbates ATP-induced neuronal death.

AB  - Abstract
Circadian rhythms in mammals are regulated by a system of circadian oscillators that includes a light-entrainable pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and food-entrainable oscillators (FEOs) elsewhere in the brain and body. In nocturnal rodents, the SCN promotes sleep in the day and wake at night, while FEOs promote an active state in anticipation of a predictable daily meal. For nocturnal animals to anticipate a daytime meal, wake-promoting signals from FEOs must compete with sleep-promoting signals from the SCN pacemaker. One hypothesis is that FEOs impose a daily rhythm of inhibition on SCN output that is timed to permit the expression of activity prior to a daytime meal. This hypothesis predicts that SCN activity should decrease prior to the onset of anticipatory activity and remain suppressed through the scheduled mealtime. To assess the hypothesis, neural activity in the SCN of mice anticipating a 4–5-h daily meal in the light period was measured using FOS immunohistochemistry and in vivo multiple unit electrophysiology. SCN FOS, quantified by optical density, was significantly reduced at the expected mealtime in food-anticipating mice with access to a running disk, compared to ad libitum-fed and acutely fasted controls. Group differences were not significant when FOS was quantified by other methods, or in mice without running disks. SCN electrical activity was markedly decreased during locomotion in some mice but increased in others. Changes in either direction were concurrent with locomotion, were not specific to food anticipation, and were not sustained during longer pauses. Reduced FOS indicates a net suppression of SCN activity that may depend on the intensity or duration of locomotion. The timing of changes in SCN activity relative to locomotion suggests that any effect of FEOs on SCN output is mediated indirectly, by feedback from neural or systemic correlates of locomotion.

AB  - Abstract
The release of the serine proteinase tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) from the presynaptic terminal of cerebral cortical neurons plays a central role in the development of synaptic plasticity, adaptation to metabolic stress and neuronal survival. Our earlier studies indicate that by inducing the recruitment of the cytoskeletal protein βII-spectrin and voltage-gated calcium channels to the active zone, tPA promotes Ca2+-dependent translocation of synaptic vesicles (SVs) to the synaptic release site where they release their load of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Here we used a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments to investigate whether this effect leads to depletion of SVs in the presynaptic terminal. Our data indicate that tPA promotes SV endocytosis via a mechanism that does not require the conversion of plasminogen into plasmin. Instead, we show that tPA induces calcineurin-mediated dynamin I dephosphorylation, which is followed by dynamin I-induced recruitment of the actin-binding protein profilin II to the presynaptic membrane, and profilin II-induced F-actin formation. We report that this tPA-induced sequence of events leads to the association of newly formed SVs with F-actin clusters in the endocytic zone. In summary, the data presented here indicate that following the exocytotic release of neurotransmitters tPA activates the mechanism whereby SVs are retrieved from the presynaptic membrane and endocytosed to replenish the pool of vesicles available for a new cycle of exocytosis. Together, these results indicate that in murine cerebral cortical neurons tPA plays a central role coupling SVs exocytosis and endocytosis.

AB  - Abstract
An orphan member of the solute carrier (SLC) family SLC10, SLC10A4 has been found to be enriched in midbrain and brainstem neurons and has been found to co-localize with and to affect dopamine (DA) homeostasis. We generated an SLC10A4 knockout mouse (Slc10a4Δ/Δ) using Cre-targeted recombination, and characterized behavioral measures of motor and cognitive function as well as DA and acetylcholine (ACh) levels in midbrain and brainstem. In agreement with previous studies, Slc10a4 mRNA was preferentially expressed in neurons in the brains of wild-type (Slc10a4+/+) mice and was enriched in dopaminergic and cholinergic regions. Slc10a4Δ/Δ mice had no impairment in motor function or novelty-induced exploratory behaviors but performed significantly worse in measures of spatial memory and cognitive flexibility. Slc10a4Δ/Δ mice also did not differ from Slc10a4+/+ in measures of anxiety. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measures on tissue punches taken from the dorsal and ventral striatum reveal a decrease in DA content and a corresponding increase in the metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), indicating an increase in DA turnover. Punches taken from the brainstem revealed a decrease in ACh as compared with Slc10a4+/+ littermates. Together, these data indicate that loss of SLC10A4 protein results in neurotransmitter imbalance and cognitive impairment.

AB  - Abstract
Connexin43 (Cx43) as a building block of gap junction channels and hemichannels exerts important functions in astrocytes. When these cells acquire a malignant phenotype Cx43 protein but not mRNA levels are downregulated, being negligible in high-grade astrocytoma or glioblastoma multiforme, the most common and deadliest of malignant primary brain tumors in adults. Some microRNAs associated to glioma target Cx43 and could explain the lack of correlation between mRNA and protein levels of Cx43 found in some high-grade astrocytomas. More importantly, these microRNAs could be a promising therapeutic target. A great number of studies have confirmed the relationship between cancer and connexins that was proposed by Loewenstein more than 40 years ago, but these studies have also revealed that this is a very complex relationship. Indeed, restoring Cx43 to glioma cells reduces their rate of proliferation and their tumorigenicity but this tumor suppressor effect could be counterbalanced by its effects on invasiveness, adhesion and migration. The mechanisms underlying these effects suggest the participation of a great variety of proteins that bind to different regions of Cx43. The present review focuses on an intrinsically disordered region of the C-terminal domain of Cx43 in which converges the interaction of several proteins, including the proto-oncogene Src. We summarize data that indicate that Cx43–Src interaction inhibits the oncogenic activity of Src and promotes a conformational change in the structure of Cx43 that allosterically modifies the binding to other important signaling proteins. As a consequence, crucial cell functions, such as proliferation or migration, could be strongly affected. We propose that the knowledge of the structural basis of the antitumorigenic effect of Cx43 on astrocytomas could help to design new therapies against this incurable disease.

AB  - Abstract
The present study was examined the blockade of CA1 orexin-1 receptors (OX1Rs) of the dorsal hippocampus in the induction or expression phase on morphine sensitization-induced memory restoration using the Morris water maze (MWM) apparatus. Results showed that pre-training administration of morphine (5 mg/kg, s.c.) increases escape latency and traveled distance, while does not alter swimming speed. This supports the impairing effect of morphine on the spatial memory acquisition in male adult rats. Also, in the retrieval session (probe trial) this treatment decreased the time spent in the target quadrant. Moreover, morphine-induced sensitization (15 or 20 mg/kg, s.c.; once daily for 3 days and followed by 5 days no drug treatment) restored the memory acquisition/retrieval deficit which had been induced by pre-training administration of morphine (5 mg/kg, s.c.). Intra-CA1 microinjection of subthreshold doses of SB-334867 (OX1Rs antagonist; 10, 20 and 40 nmol/rat), 5 min before morphine (20 mg/kg/day × 3 days, s.c.; induction phase for morphine sensitization) did not alter restoration of memory acquisition/retrieval produced by the morphine sensitization phenomenon. In contrast, microinjection of subthreshold doses of SB-334867 (10, 20 and 40 nmol/rat) into the CA1 region in the training session, 5 min prior to morphine (5 mg/kg, s.c.; expression phase for morphine sensitization) blocked the spatial memory acquisition/retrieval in morphine-sensitized rats. In conclusion, these findings show that morphine sensitization reverses morphine-induced amnesia. Furthermore, the blockade of CA1 OX1Rs in the expression phase, but not in the induction phase, disrupts memory restoration induced by morphine sensitization.

AB  - Abstract
Binge eating is defined by the consumption of an excessive amount of food in a short time, reflecting a form of hedonic eating that is not necessarily motivated by caloric need. Foods consumed during a binge are also often high in fat and/or sugar. Ghrelin, signaling centrally via the growth-hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), stimulates growth hormone release and appetite. GHSR signaling also enhances the rewarding value of palatable foods and increases the motivation for such foods. As ghrelin interacts directly with dopaminergic reward circuitry, shown to be involved in binge eating, the current studies explored the role of GHSR signaling in a limited access model of binge eating in mice. In this model, mice received either intermittent (INT) or daily (DAILY) access to a nutritionally complete high-fat diet (HFD) for 2 h late in the light cycle, alongside 24-h ad libitum chow. In CD-1 mice, 2-h exposure to HFD generated substantial binge-like intake of HFD, as well as a binge-compensate pattern of 24-h daily intake. INT and daily groups did not differ in 2-h HFD consumption, while INT mice maintained stable intake of chow despite access to HFD. GHSR knock-out (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice both binged during HFD access, and exhibited the same binge-compensate pattern. INT GHSR KO mice did not binge as much as WT, while DAILY KO and WT were comparable. Overall, GHSR KO mice consumed fewer calories from HFD, regardless of access condition. GHSR KO mice also had reduced activation of the nucleus accumbens shell, but not core, following HFD consumption. These data support the ability of INT HFD in mice to induce a binge-compensate pattern of intake that emulates select components of binge eating in humans. There also appears to be a role for GHSR signaling in driving HFD consumption under these conditions, potentially via mediation of reward-related circuitry.

Task switching is our ability to abandon an old, irrelevant task in order to perform a new, more relevant one. Data from neuropsychology and neuroimaging studies indicate hemispheric asymmetries in task switching, however the neural mechanisms subtending switching, and in particular protocols to improve switching abilities are yet to be established. The present study aimed to assess hemispheric asymmetry and practice effects in task switching by using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). To this end, tDCS has been applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of both hemispheres while subjects were performing a well-established task-switching paradigm. The task was repeated three times in three separate sessions in order to test practice effects with and without stimulation. Results show that increased hemispheric asymmetry in dorsolateral prefrontal areas improved switching performance as measured by a better practice effect, compared to sham condition. Our results support the hypothesis of dynamic hemispheric asymmetry in task switching and reinforce the notion of utilizing brain stimulation with traditional training methods in order to enhance cognitive abilities.

AB  - Abstract
We explored the changes in multi-finger synergies in patients after a single cortical stroke with mild motor impairments. We hypothesized that both synergy indices and anticipatory synergy adjustments prior to the initiation of a self-paced quick action would be diminished in the patients compared to age-matched controls. The patients with history of cortical stroke, and age-matched controls (n = 12 in each group) performed one-finger and multi-finger accurate force production tasks involving both steady-state and quick force pulse production. Finger interdependence (enslaving) and multi-finger synergies stabilizing total force were quantified. The stroke patients showed lower maximal finger forces, in particular in the contralesional hand, which also showed increased enslaving indices. Multi-finger synergies during steady-state force production were, however, unchanged after stroke. In contrast, a drop in the synergy index prior to the force pulse generation was significantly delayed in the stroke patients. Our results show that mild cortical stroke leads to no significant changes in multifinger synergies, but there is impairment in feed-forward adjustments of the synergies prior to a quick action, a drop in the maximal force production, and an increase in enslaving. We conclude that studies of synergies reveal two aspects of synergic control differentially affected by cortical stroke.

AB  - Abstract
Rewarding memories induced by addictive drugs may contribute to persistent drug-seeking behaviors, which is an important contributing factor to drug addiction. However, the biological mechanisms underlying drug-associated rewarding memories have not yet been fully understood, especially the new synthetic drugs, such as amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS). In this study, using the rat-conditioned place preference (CPP) model, a classic animal model for the reward-associated effects of addictive drugs, we found that the expression level of GABAA α1 subunits was significantly decreased in the dorsal striatum (Dstr) after conditioned methamphetamine (METH) pairing, and no significant differences were observed in the other four rewarding memory-associated areas (medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), amygdala (Amy), and dorsal hippocampus (DH)). Intra-Dstr injection of either the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol or the specific α1GABAA receptor-preferring benzodiazepine (BDZ) agonist zolpidem significantly abolished METH CPP formation. Thus, this study extends previous findings by showing that GABAA receptors, particularly the α1-containing GABAA receptors, may be strongly implicated in METH-associated rewarding memories. This work provides us with a new perspective on the goal of treating ATS addiction.

AB  - Abstract
A putative role of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in epilepsy has emerged from in vitro and animal models, but few studies have analyzed human samples. We assessed the BDNF expression of transcripts with exons I (BDNFI), II (BDNFII), IV (BDNFIV) and VI (BDNFVI) and methylation levels of promoters 4 and 6 in the hippocampi of patients with pharmaco-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) (n = 24). Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and pre-surgical pharmacological treatment were considered as clinical independent variables. A statistical significant increase for the BDNFVI (p &lt; 0.05) was observed in TLE patients compared to the autopsy control group (n = 8). BDNFVI was also increased in anxiety/depression TLE (N = 4) when compared to autopsies or to the remaining group of patients (p &lt; 0.05). In contrast, the use of the antiepileptic drug Topiramate (TPM) (N = 3) was associated to a decrease in BDNFVI expression (p &lt; 0.05) when compared to the remaining group of patients. Methylation levels at the BDNF promoters 4 and 6 were similar between TLE and autopsies and in relation to the use of either Sertraline (SRT) or TPM. These results suggest an up-regulated expression of a specific BDNF transcript in patients with TLE, an effect that seems to be dependent on the use of specific drugs.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex during voluntary contractions elicits electrophysiological and mechanical responses in the target muscle. The effect of different TMS intensities on exercise-induced changes in TMS-elicited variables is unknown, impairing data interpretation. This study aimed to investigate TMS intensity effects on maximal voluntary activation (VATMS), motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), and silent periods (SPs) in the quadriceps muscles before, during, and after exhaustive isometric exercise. Eleven subjects performed sets of ten 5-s submaximal isometric quadriceps contractions at 40% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) strength until task failure. Three different TMS intensities (I100, I75, I50) eliciting MEPs of 53 ± 6%, 38 ± 5% and 25 ± 3% of maximal compound action potential (Mmax) at 20% MVC were used. MEPs and SPs were assessed at both absolute (40% baseline MVC) and relative (50%, 75%, and 100% MVC) force levels. VATMS was assessed with I100 and I75. When measured at absolute force level, MEP/Mmax increased during exercise at I50, decreased at I100 and remained unchanged at I75. No TMS intensity effect was observed at relative force levels. At both absolute and relative force levels, SPs increased at I100 and remained stable at I75 and I50. VATMS assessed at I75 tended to be lower than at I100. TMS intensity affects exercise-induced changes in MEP/Mmax (only when measured at absolute force level), SPs, and VATMS. These results indicate a single TMS intensity assessing maximal voluntary activation and exercise-induced changes in corticomotoneuronal excitability/inhibition may be inappropriate.

AB  - Abstract
Impulsivity, which can be subdivided into impulsive action and impulsive choice, is implicated as a factor underlying drug abuse vulnerability. Although previous research has shown that dopamine (DA) systems in prefrontal cortex are involved in impulsivity and substance abuse, it is not known if inherent variation in DA transporter (DAT) function contributes to impulsivity. The current study determined if individual differences in either impulsive action or impulsive choice are related to DAT function in orbitofrontal (OFC) and/or medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Rats were first tested both for impulsive action in a cued go/no-go task and for impulsive choice in a delay-discounting task. Following behavioral evaluation, in vitro [3H]DA uptake assays were performed in OFC and mPFC isolated from individual rats. Vmax in OFC, but not mPFC, was correlated with performance in the cued go/no-go task, with decreased OFC DAT function being associated with high impulsive action. In contrast, Vmax in OFC and mPFC was not correlated with performance in the delay-discounting task. The current results demonstrate that impulsive behavior in cued go/no-go performance is associated with decreased DAT function in OFC, suggesting that hyperdopaminergic tone in this prefrontal subregion mediates, at least in part, increased impulsive action.

AB  - Abstract
The supratrigeminal nucleus (Vsup), originally proposed as a premotoneuron pool in the trigeminal reflex arc, is a key structure of jaw movement control. Surprisingly, however, the location of the rat Vsup has not precisely been defined. In light of our previous cat studies, we made two hypotheses regarding the rat Vsup: (1) the Vsup is cytoarchitectonically distinguishable from its surrounding structures; (2) the Vsup receives central axon terminals of the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus (Vmes) neurons which are primary afferents innervating muscle spindles of jaw-closing muscles and periodontal ligaments around the teeth. To test the first hypothesis, we examined the cytoarchitecture of the rat Vsup. The Vsup was identified as an area medially adjacent to the dorsomedial part of trigeminal principal sensory nucleus (Vp), and extended from the level just rostral to the caudal two-thirds of the trigeminal motor nucleus (Vmo) to the level approximately 150 μm caudal to the Vmo. Our rat Vsup was much smaller and its location was considerably different in comparison to the Vsup reported previously. To evaluate the second hypothesis, we tested the distribution patterns of Vmes primary afferent terminals in the cytoarchitectonically identified Vsup. After transganglionic tracer applications to the masseter, deep temporal, and medial pterygoid nerves, a large number of axon terminals were observed in all parts of Vsup (especially in its medial part). After applications to the inferior alveolar, infraorbital, and lingual nerves, a small number of axon terminals were labeled in the caudolateral Vsup. The Vsup could also be identified electrophysiologically. After electrical stimulation of the masseter nerve, evoked potentials with slow negative component were isolated only in the Vsup. The present findings suggest that the rat Vsup can be cytoarchitectonically and electrophysiologically identified, receives somatotopic termination of the trigeminal primary afferents, and principally receives strong termination of the spindle Vmes primary afferents.

AB  - Abstract
The neuropathic pain that results from peripheral nerve injury is associated with alterations in the properties of neurons in the superficial spinal laminae. Chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the rat sciatic nerve increases excitatory synaptic drive to excitatory neurons in the substantia gelatinosa while limiting that to inhibitory neurons. Since the calcium-binding protein calbindin D-28K has been associated with excitatory neurons, we examined whether CCI altered the properties of neurons expressing calbindin-like immunoreactivity (Cal+). These account for 30% of the neurons in lamina I and II. Calbindin did not co-localize with any particular electrophysiological phenotype of neuron; in substantia gelatinosa, it was found in some tonic, delay, irregular, phasic and transient firing neurons and in some cells that displayed central, radial or vertical morphology. When neuronal phenotype was defined more precisely in terms of both morphology and electrophysiological properties, no strong correlation with calbindin expression was found. The frequency and amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSC) in calbindin negative (Cal−) neurons was greater than that in Cal+ neurons.

CCI did not alter the proportion of Cal+ neurons in the dorsal horn. Although CCI promoted a fourfold increase in sEPSC frequency in Cal+ neurons, sEPSC amplitude was reduced by 22% and charge transfer per second was unchanged. Since synaptic drive to Cal+ neurons is weak and there is no firm correlation between neuronal phenotype and calbindin expression, it is doubtful whether these neurons play a major role in the generation of central sensitization.

AB  - Abstract
Temporal lobe epilepsy in human and animals is attributed to alterations in brain function especially hippocampus formation. Changes in synaptic activity might be causally related to the alterations during epileptogenesis. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) as one of the non-selective ion channels has been shown to be involved in synaptic transmission. However, the potential role of TRPV1 receptors in synaptic function in the epileptic brain needs to be elucidated. In the present study, we used quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), western blotting, and immunohistochemistry to assess hippocampal TRPV1 mRNA expression, protein content, and distribution. Moreover, the effects of pharmacologic activation and inhibition of TRPV1 receptors on the slope of evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were analyzed in CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons, after 3 months of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). SE induced an upregulation of TRPV1 mRNA and protein content in the whole hippocampal extract, as well as its distribution in both CA1 and CA3 regions. Activation and inhibition of TRPV1 receptors (via capsaicin 1 μM and capsazepine 10 μM, respectively) did not influence basal synaptic transmission in CA1 and CA3 regions of control slices, however, capsaicin increased and capsazepine decreased synaptic transmission in both regions in tissues from epileptic animals. Taken together, these findings suggest that a higher expression of TRPV1 in the epileptic condition is accompanied by alterations in basal synaptic transmission.

AB  - Abstract
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-elicited motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) exhibit considerable trial-to-trial variability, potentially reducing the sensitivity and reproducibility of this measure. While increasing the number of trials will improve accuracy, prolonged recording blocks are not always feasible. In this study, we investigated the minimum number of trials required to provide a measure of human corticospinal excitability that is stable both within and between sessions. Single-pulse TMS was applied to the left primary motor cortex, and MEPs were recorded from the right first dorsal interosseous muscle. Approximately 20–30 trials were required to provide a stable measure of MEP amplitude with high within- and between-session reliability. Extending the number of trials beyond 30 provided no additional benefit. Collecting 30 trials may be optimal for reliably estimating corticospinal excitability using TMS. These findings may have significant implications for using TMS to measure corticospinal excitability in both basic and clinical research settings.

AB  - Abstract
Beta-arrestins (β-arrs) are initially known as negative regulators of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Recently, there is increasing evidence suggesting that β-arrs also serve as scaffolds and adapters that mediate distinct intracellular signal transduction initiated by GPCR activation. In the previous study, we have shown that metabotropic glutamate receptor 7 (mGluR7) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) signaling may be involved in the developmental sevoflurane neurotoxicity. In the present study, we showed that activation of mGluR7 with a group III mGluRs orthosteric agonist LAP4 or an atypical mGluR7 allosteric agonist N,N′-bis(diphenylmethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine dihydrochloride (AMN082) significantly attenuated sevoflurane-induced neuronal apoptosis. Interestingly, this neuroprotective role of LAP4 could be partially reduced by β-arr1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) or β-arr2 siRNA transfection. In contrast, β-arr2 siRNA transfection alone abolished the effects of AMN082 on sevoflurane neurotoxicity. In addition, administration of LAP4 or AMN082 significantly enhanced Phospho-ERK1/2 in sevoflurane neurotoxicity, which could be abrogated by β-arr2 siRNA transfection, but not by β-arr1 siRNA transfection. Increased β-arr2-dependent Phospho-ERK1/2 signaling alleviated sevoflurane neurotoxicity by inhibiting bad phosphorylation. We also found that the neuroprotective role of AMN082 was completely reversed by ERK1/2 inhibitor 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis[2-aminophenylthio]butadiene (U0126). Alternatively, treatment with U0126 partially suppressed the neuroprotective of LAP4, suggesting that other mechanisms may be implicated in this process. Further investigation indicated that, in the scenario of sevoflurane neurotoxicity, application of LAP4 (but not AMN082) increased the interaction of β-arrs with transcriptional factors CREB binding protein (CBP) and p300. LAP4 also enhanced the β-arr1-dependent H3 and H4 acetylation in sevoflurane neurotoxicity. For the behavior study, treatment with LAP4 or AMN082 significantly improved the emotional and spatial learning and memory disorders induced by postnatal sevoflurane exposure. These results suggested that β-arr1 and 2 may differently modulate mGluR7 signaling in developmental sevoflurane neurotoxicity. This study also reveals a β-arr-biased agonism at GPCRs (e.g. mGluR7).

AB  - Abstract
Individual differences in human temperament can increase the risk of psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety. Our laboratory utilized a rat model of temperamental differences to assess neurodevelopmental factors underlying emotional behavior differences. Rats selectively bred for low novelty exploration (Low Responders, LR) display high levels of anxiety- and depression-like behavior compared to High Novelty Responder (HR) rats. Using transcriptome profiling, the present study uncovered vast gene expression differences in the early postnatal HR versus LR limbic brain, including changes in genes involved in cellular metabolism. These data led us to hypothesize that rats prone to high (versus low) anxiety/depression-like behavior exhibit distinct patterns of brain metabolism during the first weeks of life, which may reflect disparate patterns of synaptogenesis and brain circuit development. Thus, in a second experiment we examined activity of cytochrome C oxidase (COX), an enzyme responsible for ATP production and a correlate of metabolic activity, to explore functional energetic differences in the HR/LR early postnatal brain. We found that HR rats display higher COX activity in the amygdala and specific hippocampal subregions compared to LRs during the first 2 weeks of life. Correlational analysis examining COX levels across several brain regions and multiple early postnatal time points suggested desynchronization in the developmental timeline of the limbic HR versus LR brain during the first two postnatal weeks. These early divergent COX activity levels may reflect altered circuitry or synaptic activity in the early postnatal HR/LR brain, which could contribute to the emergence of their distinct behavioral phenotypes.

AB  - Abstract
Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) convey an increased risk for developing dementia. The microtubule-associated protein tau is implicated in neurodegenerative disease by undergoing hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, leading to cytotoxicity and neurodegeneration. Enzymes involved in the regulation of tau phosphorylation, such as GSK3β, are tightly associated with pathways found to be dysregulated in T2DM. We have shown previously that leptin-resistant mice, which develop obesity and a diabetic phenotype, display elevated levels of tau phosphorylation. Here we show cells cultured with leptin, an adipokine shown to have neuroprotective effects, reduces tau phosphorylation. To explore how this mechanism works in vivo we transduced an existing diabetic mouse line (Leprdb/db) with a tau mutant (tauP301L) via adeno-associated virus (AAV). The resulting phenotype included a striking increase in tau phosphorylation and the number of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) found within the hippocampus. We conclude that leptin resistance-induced obesity and diabetes accelerates the development of tau pathology. This model of metabolic dysfunction and tauopathy provides a new system in which to explore the mechanisms underlying the ways in which leptin resistance and diabetes influence development of tau pathology, and may ultimately be related to the development of NFTs.

AB  - Abstract
The objective of the study was to examine whether axotomy and 17β-estradiol affects P2X7 receptor expression and distribution in the hypoglossal nucleus.

The left hypoglossal nerve of ovariectomized mice was cut and animals received a single injection of 17β-estradiol (25 μg/100 g b.w. in 20% (2-hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin) or vehicle one hour after axotomy. Mice were sacrificed on day 4 following surgery. The area fraction of P2X7 receptor immunoreactive structures and of CD11b immunolabeled microglia, P2X7 protein concentration, and the immunoreactivity pattern of estrogen receptor (ER) alpha/beta were analyzed on both sides of the hypoglossal nucleus.

Following axotomy the area fraction of P2X7 immunoreactive neurons showed a decreasing tendency, while the area fraction of P2X7 immunolabeled microglia increased significantly on the axotomized side compared with the control side in mice injected with vehicle. In animals treated with 17β-estradiol the decrease in area fraction of neural and the increase in area fraction of microglial P2X7 immunostaining on the axotomized side were significantly enhanced compared with animals injected with vehicle. The P2X7 immunoreactivity pattern on the control side of the nucleus remained unchanged after 17β-estradiol injection. Semi-quantitative Western blots revealed no significant difference in P2X7 protein concentration comparing the axotomized side with the control side in either experimental group. The CD11b immunoreactive microglia area fraction increased significantly following axotomy, but was not affected by 17β-estradiol. Neither ER alpha, nor beta colocalized with CD11b.

Our results suggest that axotomy induces cell-type specific changes in P2X7 receptor expression, which may be directly regulated by 17β-estradiol through ER alpha or beta in neurons, but not in activated microglia.

AB  - Abstract
Streptococcus pneumoniae is the causative agent of numerous diseases including severe invasive infections such as bacteremia and meningitis. It has been previously shown that strains of S. pneumoniae that are unable to survive in the bloodstream may colonize the CNS. However, information on cellular components and pathways involved in the neurotropism of these strains is still scarce. The olfactory system is a specialized tissue in which olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) are interfacing with the external environment through several microvilli. Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) which also form the glial limiting membrane at the surface of the olfactory bulb (OB) are the only cells that ensheathe the ORNs axons. Since previous data from our group showed that OECs may harbor S. pneumoniae, we decided to test whether infection of the OB or OEC cultures modulates the expression levels of neurotrophic factor’s mRNA and its putative effects on the activation and viability of microglia. We observed that neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and glial cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) expression was significantly higher in the OB from uninfected mice than in infected mice. A similar result was observed when we infected OEC cultures. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BNDF) expression was significantly lower in the OB from infected mice than in uninfected mice. In contrast, in vitro infection of OECs resulted in a significant increase of BDNF mRNA expression. An upregulation of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) expression was observed in both OB and OEC cultures infected with S. pneumoniae. Moreover, we found that conditioned medium from infected OEC cultures induced the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein cleaved-caspase-3 and an apparently continuous nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) p65 activation in the N13 microglia. Altogether, our data suggest the possible existence of an OEC–pathogen molecular interface, through which the OECs could interfere on the activation and viability of microglia, favoring the access of non-hematogenous S. pneumoniae strains to the CNS in the absence of bacteremia.

AB  - Abstract
Intensification of craving elicited by drug-associated cues during abstinence occurs over time in human cocaine users while elevation of cue reactivity (“incubation”) is observed in rats exposed to extended forced abstinence from cocaine self-administration. Incubation in rodents has been linked to time-dependent neuronal plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We tested the hypothesis that incubation of cue reactivity during abstinence from cocaine self-administration is accompanied by lower potency and/or efficacy of the selective serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT2C​ receptor (5-HT2CR) agonist WAY163909 to suppress cue reactivity and a shift in the subcellular localization profile of the mPFC 5-HT2CR protein. We observed incubation of cue reactivity (measured as lever presses reinforced by the discrete cue complex) between Day 1 and Day 30 of forced abstinence from cocaine relative to sucrose self-administration. Pharmacological and biochemical analyses revealed that the potency of the selective 5-HT2CR agonist WAY163909 to suppress cue reactivity, the expression of synaptosomal 5-HT2CR protein in the mPFC, and the membrane to cytoplasmic expression of the 5-HT2CR in mPFC were lower on Day 30 vs. Day 1 of forced abstinence from cocaine self-administration. Incubation of cue reactivity assessed during forced abstinence from sucrose self-administration did not associate with 5-HT2CR protein expression in the mPFC. Collectively, these outcomes are the first indication that neuroadaptations in the 5-HT2CR system may contribute to incubation of cocaine cue reactivity.

AB  - Abstract
High sugar consumption is a risk factor for metabolic disturbances leading to memory impairment. Thus, rats subject to high sucrose intake (HSu) develop a metabolic syndrome and display memory deficits. We now investigated if these HSu-induced memory deficits were associated with metabolic and electrophysiological alterations in the hippocampus. Male Wistar rats were submitted for 9 weeks to a sucrose-rich diet (35% sucrose solution) and subsequently to a battery of behavioral tests; after sacrifice, their hippocampi were collected for ex vivo high-resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) metabolic characterization and electrophysiological extracellular recordings in slices. HSu rats displayed a decreased memory performance (object displacement and novel object recognition tasks) and helpless behavior (forced swimming test), without altered locomotion (open field). HRMAS analysis indicated a similar hippocampal metabolic profile of HSu and control rats. HSu rats also displayed no change of synaptic transmission and plasticity (long-term potentiation) in hippocampal Schaffer fibers-CA1 pyramid synapses, but had decreased amplitude of long-term depression in the temporoammonic (TA) pathway. Furthermore, HSu rats had an increased density of inhibitory adenosine A1 receptors (A1R), that translated into a greater potency of A1R in Schaffer fiber synapses, but not in the TA pathway, whereas the endogenous activation of A1R in HSu rats was preserved in the TA pathway but abolished in Schaffer fiber synapses. These results suggest that HSu triggers a hippocampal-dependent memory impairment that is not associated with altered hippocampal metabolism but is probably related to modified synaptic plasticity in hippocampal TA synapses

Annexin A2 (ANX2) is a calcium (Ca2+)-binding protein that binds to acidic phospholipids and is known to play a crucial role in many cellular regulatory processes. In particular, ANX2 has been described as a crucial receptor for thrombolysis by the tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasmin system. In the nervous system, tPA is involved in processes of neuronal plasticity such as hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and in the dorsal horn pain in several pain models. We investigated detailed changes in expression of ANX2 after nerve injury and evaluated the interaction with tPA using the rat spared nerve injury (SNI) model. SNI-induced the expression of ANX2 in L4/5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. In the spinal cord, constitutive ANX2-immunoreactivity was expressed in laminae I–II. Peripheral nerve injury increased the ANX2 immunoreactive terminals mainly in laminae I–V of the dorsal horn on the side ipsilateral to the nerve injury. Double-labeling analysis revealed the co-localization of ANX2 with tPA in the axons of primary afferents in the dorsal horn. Experimental inhibition of ANX2 and tPA interaction by intrathecal administration of homocysteine significantly prevented and reversed SNI-induced mechanical allodynia. Thus, alterations of ANX2 may be involved in tPA-dependent plasticity after peripheral nerve injury and have an important role in neuropathic pain.

AB  - Abstract
High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a ligand of receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE), functions as a proinflammatory factor. It is mainly involved in inflammatory activation and contributes to the initiation and progression of stroke. By using a model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in type 2 diabetic rats, we investigated the changes of pro-inflammation mediators, blood–brain barrier (BBB) leakage and functional outcome after stroke. Type 2 diabetic rats did not show an increased lesion volume, but exhibited significantly increased expression of HMGB1 and RAGE, BBB leakage, as well as decreased functional outcome after stroke compared with control rats. Injection of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) into type 2 diabetic rats significantly reduced the expression of HMGB1 and RAGE, attenuated BBB leakage, and improved functional outcome after stroke. BMSCs-treated type 2 diabetic rats inhibited inflammation and improved functional outcome after stroke. Furthermore, in vitro data support the hypothesis that BMSCs-induced reduction of HMGB1 and RAGE in T2DM-MCAo rats contributed to attenuated inflammatory response in the ischemic brain, which may lead to the beneficial effects of BMSCs treatment. Further investigation of BMSCs treatment in type 2 diabetic stroke is warranted.

Studies on classification learning suggested that altered dopamine function in Parkinson’s Disease (PD) specifically affects learning from feedback. In patients OFF medication, enhanced learning from negative feedback has been described. This learning bias was not seen in observational learning from feedback, indicating different neural mechanisms for this type of learning. The present study aimed to compare the acquisition of stimulus–response–outcome associations in PD patients OFF medication and healthy control subjects in active and observational learning. 16 PD patients OFF medication and 16 controls were examined with three parallel learning tasks each, two feedback-based (active and observational) and one non-feedback-based paired associates task. No acquisition deficit was seen in the patients for any of the tasks. More detailed analyses on the learning strategies did, however, reveal that the patients showed more lose-shift responses during active feedback learning than controls, and that lose-shift and win-stay responses more strongly determined performance accuracy in patients than controls. For observational feedback learning, the performance of both groups correlated similarly with the performance in non-feedback-based paired associates learning and with the accuracy of observed performance. Also, patients and controls showed comparable evidence of feedback processing in observational learning. In active feedback learning, PD patients use alternative learning strategies than healthy controls. Analyses on observational learning did not yield differences between patients and controls, adding to recent evidence of a differential role of the human striatum in active and observational learning from feedback.

AB  - Abstract
While activation of cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1R) regulates a variety of retinal neuronal functions by modulating ion channels in these cells, effect of activated cannabinoid receptors on Ca2+ channels in retinal Müller cells is still largely unknown. In the present work we show that three subunits of T-type Ca2+ channels, CaV3.1, CaV3.2 and CaV3.3, as well as one subunit of L-type Ca2+ channels, CaV1.2, were expressed in rat Müller cells by immunofluorescent staining. Consistently, nimodipine- and mibefradil-sensitive Na+ currents through L- and T-type Ca2+ channels could be recorded electrophysiologically. The cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55212-2 significantly suppressed Ca2+ channel currents, mainly the T-type one, in acutely isolated rat Müller cells in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 of 3.98 μM. The WIN55212-2 effect was not blocked by AM251/SR141716, specific CB1R antagonists. Similar suppression of the currents was observed when anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), endogenous ligands of cannabinoid receptors, were applied. Moreover, even though CB2 receptors (CB2Rs) were expressed in rat Müller cells, the effects of WIN55212-2 and 2-AG on Ca2+ channel currents were not blocked by AM630, a selective CB2R antagonist. However, the effect of AEA could be partially rescued by AM630. These results suggest that WIN55212-2 and 2-AG receptor-independently suppressed the Ca2+ channel currents in Müller cells, while AEA suppressed the currents partially through CB2Rs. The existence of receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms suggests that cannabinoids may modulate Müller cell functions through multiple pathways.

AB  - Abstract
17β-Estradiol (E2) crucially affects several processes in the hippocampus of both sexes. E2 acts upon estradiol receptors ERα and ERβ, influencing target gene expression and/or modulates intracellular signaling cascades. Another potent modulator of hippocampal function is nucleoside adenosine, the final product of ectonucleotidase cascade, enzymes which hydrolyze extracellular ATP to adenosine. The last and rate-limiting step of the hydrolysis is catalyzed by membrane-bound ecto-5′-nucleotidase (eN). Previous findings obtained on adenosine metabolism in brain suggest that eN may be modulated by ovarian steroids. Therefore, the present study reports that the activity and protein abundance of membrane-bound eN fluctuates across the estrus cycle in the hippocampal synaptosomes of female rats. Further, we analyzed the role of E2 and its intracellular receptors on the expression of eN in ovariectomized females. We found that E2 upregulated eN activity and protein abundance in the hippocampal synaptosomes. Application of nonspecific ER antagonist, ICI 182,780 and selective ERα and ERβ agonists, PPT and DPN, respectively, demonstrated the involvement of both receptor subtypes in observed actions. Selective ERα receptor agonist, PPT, induced upregulation of both the protein level and activity of eN, while application of selective ERβ receptor agonist, DPN, increased only the activity of eN. In both cases, E2 entered into the intracellular compartment and activated ER(s), which was demonstrated by membrane impermeable E2–BSA conjugate. Together these results imply that E2-induced effects on connectivity and functional properties of the hippocampal synapses may be in part mediated through observed effect on eN.

AB  - Abstract
Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a widely used animal model for the human disease multiple sclerosis (MS), a demyelinating and neurodegenerative pathology of the central nervous system. Both diseases share physiopathological and clinical characteristics, mainly associated with a neuroinflammatory process that leads to a set of motor, sensory, and cognitive symptoms. In MS, gray matter atrophy is related to the emergence of cognitive deficits and contributes to clinical progression. In particular, injury and dysfunction in certain areas of the frontal cortex (FrCx) have been related to the development of cognitive impairments with high incidence, like central fatigue and executive dysfunction. In the present work we show the presence of region-specific microglia and astrocyte activation in the FrCx, during the first hours of acute EAE onset. It is accompanied by the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α, in the absence of detectable leukocyte infiltration. These findings expand previous studies showing presynaptic neural dysfunction occurring at the FrCx and might contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the genesis and prevalence of common MS symptoms.

AB  - Abstract
Purpose: Spike and wave discharges (SWDs), generated within cortico-thalamo-cortical networks, are the electroencephalographic biomarker of absence epilepsy. The current work aims to identify mechanisms of SWD initiation, maintenance and termination by the analyses of dynamics and directionality of mutual interactions between the neocortex and various functionally different thalamic nuclei. Methods: Local-field potential recordings of 16 male Wistar Albino Glaxo from Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats, equipped with electrodes targeting layer 4–6 of the somatosensory cortex, rostral and caudal reticular thalamic nuclei (rRTN and cRTN), ventro-posteromedial (VPM), anterior (ATN) and posterior (PO) thalamic nuclei, were obtained. 3 s epochs prior to SWD onset, after SWD onset, prior to SWD offset and after SWD offset were analyzed with newly developed time-variant adapted nonlinear Granger causality. Results: A gradual increase in coupling toward SWD onset between cortico-cortical pairs appears as early as 2 s preictally. Next first unidirectional increase in coupling is noticed in a restricted number of cortico-thalamic and thalamo-cortical channel pairs, which turn into bidirectional coupling approaching SWD onset, and a gradual increase of intrathalamic coupling. Seizure onset is characterized by a coupling decrease for more than a second in a majority of channel pairs, only the cortex kept driving the cRTN. Intrathalamically the cRTN drives the PO, VPM and ATN. Most channel pairs no longer show differences in coupling with baseline during SWD maintenance, a major exception is the unidirectional coupling between cortex and cRTN. Toward the end of SWDs, more and more channel pairs show an increase in often bidirectional coupling, this increase suddenly vanishes at SWD offset. Conclusion: The initiation of SWD is due to a gradual increase in intracortical coupling, followed by a selective increase in first unidirectional and later bidirectional coupling between the cortex and thalamus and also intrathalamically. Once the network is oscillating, coupling decreases in most of the channel pairs, although the cortex keeps its influence on the cRTN. The SWD is dampened by a gradual increase in coupling strength and in the number of channel pairs that influence each other; the latter might represent an endogenous brake of SWDs.

AB  - Abstract
The relationship between recognition memory and cognitive control is an important research topic. The current study investigated how conflict control influences an individual’s emotional memory. During the encoding phase, participants were required to judge the affective valence of a Chinese Chengyu word (either positive or negative) in a modified Simon paradigm and to remember the word. Half of the words were presented in the congruent condition and the other half were displayed in the incongruent condition. During the retrieval phase, participants were instructed to make an ‘old/new judgment’ and decide whether the word had been presented previously. Electrophysiological responses were recorded using the event-related potential (ERP) technique. The behavioral results of retrieval processes showed that participants remembered more positive than negative words when they were encoded in the congruent condition. The electrophysiological results revealed that the retrieval of words encoded in the incongruent condition elicited less negative frontal negativity (FN) and early posterior negativity (EPN) amplitudes than those encoded in the congruent condition. The retrieval of words encoded in the incongruent condition induced greater late positive complex (LPC) amplitudes, relative to those encoded in the congruent condition on the left hemisphere. It was also observed that the recognition of positive words induced faster LPC responses than negative words when they were encoded in the incongruent condition. The present electrophysiological study illustrates that emotional memory processes may be affected by conflict control.

AB  - Abstract
Microglial activation results in profound morphological, functional and gene expression changes that affect the pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of these cells. Although statins have beneficial effects on inflammation, they have not been thoroughly investigated for their ability to affect microglial functions. Therefore the effects of rosuvastatin, one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in cardiovascular therapy, either alone or in combination with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), were profiled in pure microglial cultures derived from the forebrains of 18-day-old rat embryos. To reveal the effects of rosuvastatin on a number of pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, we performed morphometric, functional and gene expression studies relating to cell adhesion and proliferation, phagocytosis, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and IL-10, respectively) production, and the expression of various inflammation-related genes, including those related to the above morphological parameters and cellular functions. We found that microglia could be an important therapeutic target of rosuvastatin. In unchallenged (control) microglia, rosuvastatin inhibited proliferation and cell adhesion, but promoted microspike formation and elevated the expression of certain anti-inflammatory genes (Cxcl1, Ccl5, Mbl2), while phagocytosis or pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production were unaffected. Moreover, rosuvastatin markedly inhibited microglial activation in LPS-challenged cells by affecting both their morphology and functions as it inhibited LPS-elicited phagocytosis and inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1β, TNF-α) production, concomitantly increasing the level of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine. Finally, rosuvastatin beneficially and differentially affected the expression of a number of inflammation-related genes in LPS-challenged cells by inhibiting numerous pro-inflammatory and stimulating several anti-inflammatory genes. Since the microglia could elicit pro-inflammatory responses leading to neurodegeneration, it is important to attenuate such mechanisms and promote anti-inflammatory properties, and develop prophylactic therapies. By beneficially regulating both pro- and anti-inflammatory microglial functions, rosuvastatin may be considered as a prophylactic agent in the prevention of inflammation-related neurological disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Expression of the immediate-early gene fos (also known as c-fos) and phosphorylation of the product of the early response gene atf2 (pATF2) in the adult auditory brainstem can be modulated by electrical intracochlear stimulation. The Fos and pATF2 proteins are competitive monomers of the heterodimeric activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor that triggers the expression of genes related to neural plasticity. Our previous findings showed that the stimulation-induced spatio-temporal pattern of Fos expression in the adult auditory system depends on hearing experience. In this study, we aimed to identify a possible correlation of pATF2 and Fos expression. Adult normal hearing and neonatally deafened rats were unilaterally stimulated with a cochlear implant (CI) for 45 min, 73 min, or 2 h. The numbers of Fos- and pATF2-positive neurons in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN), the lateral superior olive (LSO), and the central inferior colliculus (CIC) were evaluated. Following stimulation, an increased Fos expression was demonstrated in all these regions in hearing and deaf rats. However, in neonatally deafened rats, significantly more Fos-positive neurons emerged that did not obey a tonotopic order. Independent of hearing experience, Fos expression correlated with a locally matching decrease of pATF2 expression in AVCN and LSO, but not in CIC. We suggest that these changes in gene expression result in a shift of AP-1 dimer composition from ATF2:Jun to Fos:Jun. This change in AP-1 constellation is expected to invoke different transcriptional cascades leading to distinct modes of tissue reorganization and plasticity responses in the mature central auditory system under stimulation.

In this study, we examined the effect of bilateral intra-basolateral amygdala (intra-BLA) microinjections of dopamine receptor agents on amnesia induced by a β-carboline alkaloid, harmaline in mice. We used a step-down method to assess memory and then, hole-board method to assess exploratory behaviors. The results showed that pre-training intra-BLA injections of dopamine D1 receptor antagonist and agonist (SCH23390 (0.5 μg/mouse) and SKF38393 (0.5 μg/mouse), respectively) impaired memory acquisition. In contrast, pre-training intra-BLA injections of dopamine D2 receptor antagonist and agonist (sulpiride and quinpirole, respectively) have no significant effect on memory acquisition. Pre-training intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection of harmaline (1 mg/kg) decreased memory acquisition. However, co-administration of SCH 23390 (0.01 μg/mouse) with different doses of harmaline did not alter amnesia. Conversely, pre-training intra-BLA injection of SKF38393 (0.1 μg/mouse), sulpiride (0.25 μg/mouse) or quinpirole (0.1 μg/mouse) reversed harmaline (1 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced amnesia. Furthermore, all above doses of drugs had no effect on locomotor activity. In conclusion, the dopamine D1 and D2 receptors of the BLA may be involved in the impairment of memory acquisition induced by harmaline.

AB  - Abstract
Our aim was to enhance the spontaneous slow-frequency EEG activity during the resting state using oscillating transcranial direct currents (tDCS) with a stimulation frequency that resembles the spontaneous oscillations of sleep onset. Accordingly, in this preliminary study, we assessed EEG after-effects of a frontal oscillatory tDCS with different frequency (0.8 vs. 5 Hz) and polarity (anodal, cathodal, and sham).

Two single-blind experiments compared the after effects on the resting EEG of oscillatory tDCS [Exp. 1 = 0.8 Hz, 10 subjects (26.2 ± 2.5 years); Exp. 2 = 5 Hz, 10 subjects (27.4 ± 2.4 years)] by manipulating its polarity.

EEG signals recorded (28 scalp derivations) before and after stimulation [slow oscillations (0.5–1 Hz), delta (1–4 Hz), theta (5–7 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), beta 1 (13–15 Hz) and beta 2 (16–24 Hz)] were compared between conditions as a function of polarity (anodal vs. cathodal vs. sham) and frequency of stimulation (0.8 vs. 5 Hz).

We found a significant relative enhancement of the delta activity after the anodal tDCS at 5 Hz compared to that at 0.8 Hz. This increase, even though not reaching the statistical significance compared to sham, is concomitant to a significant increase of subjective sleepiness, as assessed by a visual analog scale. These two phenomena are linearly related with a regional specificity, correlations being restricted to cortical areas perifocal to the stimulation site.

We have shown that a frontal oscillating anodal tDCS at 5 Hz results in an effective change of both subjective sleepiness and spontaneous slow-frequency EEG activity. These changes are critically associated to both stimulation polarity (anodal) and frequency (5 Hz). However, evidence of frequency-dependence seems more unequivocal than evidence of polarity-dependence.

AB  - Abstract
The involvement of the prefrontal cortex in pain processing has been recently addressed. We studied the role of the infralimbic cortex (IL) and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in descending modulation of nociception in control and monoarthritic (ARTH) conditions. Nociception was assessed using heat-induced paw withdrawal while drugs were microinjected in the IL of rats. Local anesthesia of the IL or the adjacent prelimbic cortex (PL) facilitated nociception, indicating that IL and PL are tonically promoting spinal antinociception. Phasic activation with glutamate (GLU) revealed opposing roles of the PL and IL; GLU in the PL had a fast antinociceptive action, while in the IL it had a slow onset pronociceptive action. IL administration of a local anesthetic or GLU produced identical results in ARTH and control animals. An mGluR5 agonist in the IL induced a pronociceptive effect in both groups, while mGluR5 antagonists had no effect in controls but induced antinociception in ARTH rats. Activation of the IL mGluR1 (through co-administration of mGluR1/5 agonist and mGluR5 antagonist) did not alter nociception in controls but induced antinociception in ARTH animals. IL administration of an mGluR1 antagonist failed to alter nociception in either experimental group. Finally, mGluR5 but not mGluR1 antagonists blocked the pronociceptive action of GLU in both groups. The results indicate that IL contributes to descending modulation of nociception. mGluR5 in the IL enhance nociception in healthy control and monoarthritic animals, an effect that is tonic in ARTH. Moreover, activation of IL mGluR1s attenuates nociception following the development of monoarthritis.

Microtine rodents display diverse patterns of social organization and behaviors, and thus provide a useful model for studying the effects of the social environment on physiology and behavior. The current study compared the species differences and the effects of oxytocin (OT) on anxiety-like, social affiliation, and social recognition behaviors in female meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) and prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster). Furthermore, cell proliferation and survival in the brains of adult female meadow and prairie voles were compared. We found that female meadow voles displayed a higher level of anxiety-like behavior but lower levels of social affiliation and social recognition compared to female prairie voles. In addition, meadow voles showed lower levels of cell proliferation (measured by Ki67 staining) and cell survival (measured by BrdU staining) in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and amygdala (AMY), but not the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (DG), than prairie voles. Interestingly, the numbers of new cells in the VMH and AMY, but not DG, also correlated with anxiety-like, social affiliation, and social recognition behaviors in a brain region-specific manner. Finally, central OT treatment (200 ng/kg, icv) did not lead to changes in behavior or cell proliferation/survival in the brain. Together, these data indicate a potential role of cell proliferation/survival in selected brain areas on different behaviors between vole species with distinct life strategies.

AB  - Abstract
Neuropathic pain is treated using serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors with mixed results. Pain facilitation mediated by α1-adrenoceptors may be involved, but whether norepinephrine (NE) is tonically released is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine whether NE is tonically released from A7 cells following chronic constriction injury (CCI), and if the lateral hypothalamus (LH) plays a role in this release in male and female rats with nociceptive and neuropathic pain types. Neuropathic groups received left CCI while nociceptive groups remained naïve to injury. Fourteen days later, rats were given intrathecal infusion of either the α1-adrenoceptor antagonist WB4101, the α2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (74 μg), or normal saline for control. Paw withdrawal latency (PWL) from a thermal stimulus was measured. The generalized estimated equation method was used for statistical analysis. Nociceptive rats given WB4101 had a PWL significantly longer than saline control (7.89 ± 0.63 vs. 5.87 ± 0.52 s), while the PWL of neuropathic rats given WB4101 was 13.20 ± 0.52 s compared to 6.78 ± 0.52 s for the saline control rats. Yohimbine had no significant effect. Microinjection of cobalt chloride (CoCl) in the A7 catecholamine cell group to prevent synaptic transmission blocked the effect of WB4101 in all groups, supporting the notion that spinally descending A7 cells tonically release NE that contributes to α1-mediated nociceptive facilitation. Microinjection of CoCl into the left LH blocked the effect of WB4101 in nociceptive and neuropathic male rats, but had no effect in female rats of either pain type, suggesting differential innervation. These findings indicate that tonic release of NE acts at pronociceptive α1-adrenoceptors, that this effect is greater in rats with nerve damage, and that, while NE comes primarily from the A7 cell group, LH innervation of the A7 cell group is different between the sexes.

AB  - Abstract
To elucidate the neural substrate associated with capabilities for kinesthetic motor imagery of difficult whole-body movements, we measured brain activity during a trial involving both kinesthetic motor imagery and action observation as well as during a trial with action observation alone. Brain activity was assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Nineteen participants imagined three types of whole-body movements with the horizontal bar: the giant swing, kip, and chin-up during action observation. No participant had previously tried to perform the giant swing. The vividness of kinesthetic motor imagery as assessed by questionnaire was highest for the chin-up, less for the kip and lowest for the giant swing. Activity in the primary visual cortex (V1) during kinesthetic motor imagery with action observation minus that during action observation alone was significantly greater in the giant swing condition than in the chin-up condition within participants. Across participants, V1 activity of kinesthetic motor imagery of the kip during action observation minus that during action observation alone was negatively correlated with vividness of the kip imagery. These results suggest that activity in V1 is dependent upon the capability of kinesthetic motor imagery for difficult whole-body movements. Since V1 activity is likely related to the creation of a visual image, we speculate that visual motor imagery is recruited unintentionally for the less vivid kinesthetic motor imagery of difficult whole-body movements.

AB  - Abstract
Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, inflammatory and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). As there is no cure for this disease, new therapeutic strategies and prophylactic measures are necessary. We recently described the therapeutic activity of the association between myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide (MOG) and active vitamin D3 (VitD) against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The objective of this work was to evaluate the prophylactic potential of this association in EAE. C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated with MOG in the presence of VitD and then subjected to EAE induction. Animals were euthanized 7 and 19 days after disease induction and the following parameters were evaluated: body weight, clinical score, inflammatory process in the CNS, amount of dendritic cells (DCs) and regulatory T cells in the spleen and cytokine production by spleen and CNS cell cultures. Vaccination with MOG associated with VitD determined a drastic reduction in clinical score, body weight loss, CNS inflammation, DCs maturation and also in the production of cytokines by CNS and spleen cell cultures. Collectively, our data indicate that this association prevents EAE development. A similar effect from specific self-antigens associated with VitD is expected in other autoimmune conditions and deserves to be experimentally appraised.

AB  - Abstract
Brain responses to discrete short sounds have been studied intensively using the event-related potential (ERP) method, in which the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal is divided into epochs time-locked to stimuli of interest. Here we introduce and apply a novel technique which enables one to isolate ERPs in human elicited by continuous music. The ERPs were recorded during listening to a Tango Nuevo piece, a deep techno track and an acoustic lullaby. Acoustic features related to timbre, harmony, and dynamics of the audio signal were computationally extracted from the musical pieces. Negative deflation occurring around 100 milliseconds after the stimulus onset (N100) and positive deflation occurring around 200 milliseconds after the stimulus onset (P200) ERP responses to peak changes in the acoustic features were distinguishable and were often largest for Tango Nuevo. In addition to large changes in these musical features, long phases of low values that precede a rapid increase – and that we will call Preceding Low-Feature Phases – followed by a rapid increase enhanced the amplitudes of N100 and P200 responses. These ERP responses resembled those to simpler sounds, making it possible to utilize the tradition of ERP research with naturalistic paradigms.

AB  - Abstract
High levels of chronic stress or stress hormones are associated with depressive-like behavior in animal models. However, slight elevations in corticosterone (CORT) – the major stress hormone in rodents – have also been associated with improved performances, albeit in a sex-dependent manner. Some of the discrepancies in the literature regarding the effects of high CORT levels may be due to different administrations methods. The current study aims to compare the effects of ∼40 mg/kg given either via subcutaneous injection, through an implanted pellet, or in the drinking water, for ∼21 days on CORT serum levels, depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test (FST), and neurogenesis levels in the dentate gyrus (DG) in adult female rats. We found that animals exposed to the daily injections showed elevated CORT levels throughout the administration period, while the pellet animals showed only a transient increase, and drinking water animals revealed no elevation in CORT in serum. In addition, only the injection group exhibited higher levels of immobility in the FST. Interestingly, animals receiving CORT via injection or drinking water had lower numbers of doublecortin-positive cells in the ventral DG one week after the last CORT administration compared to animals implanted with a CORT pellet. These results will contribute to the growing literature on the effects of chronic CORT exposure and may help to clarify some of the discrepancies among previous studies, particularly in females.

The aims of this study were to use functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the neural bases for perceptual-cognitive superiority in a hockey anticipation task. Thirty participants (15 hockey players, 15 non-hockey players) lay in an MRI scanner while performing a video-based task in which they predicted the direction of an oncoming shot in either a hockey or a badminton scenario. Video clips were temporally occluded either 160 ms before the shot was made or 60 ms after the ball/shuttle left the stick/racquet. Behavioral data showed a significant hockey expertise × video-type interaction in which hockey experts were superior to novices with hockey clips but there were no significant differences with badminton clips. The imaging data on the other hand showed a significant main effect of hockey expertise and of video type (hockey vs. badminton), but the expertise × video-type interaction did not survive either a whole-brain or a small-volume correction for multiple comparisons. Further analysis of the expertise main effect revealed that when watching hockey clips, experts showed greater activation in the rostral inferior parietal lobule, which has been associated with an action observation network, and greater activation than novices in Brodmann areas 17 and 18 and middle frontal gyrus when watching badminton videos. The results provide partial support both for domain-specific and domain-general expertise effects in an action anticipation task.

AB  - Abstract
Exposure to blast overpressure (BOP) is associated with behavioral, cognitive, and neuroimaging abnormalities. We investigated the dynamic responses of cortical vasculature and its relation to microglia/macrophage activation in mice using intravital two-photon microscopy following mild blast exposure. We found that blast caused vascular dysfunction evidenced by microdomains of aberrant vascular permeability. Microglial/macrophage activation was specifically associated with these restricted microdomains, as evidenced by rapid microglial process retraction, increased ameboid morphology, and escape of blood-borne Q-dot tracers that were internalized in microglial/macrophage cell bodies and phagosome-like compartments. Microdomains of cortical vascular disruption and microglial/macrophage activation were also associated with aberrant tight junction morphology that was more prominent after repetitive (3×) blast exposure. Repetitive, but not single, BOPs also caused TNFα elevation two weeks post-blast. In addition, following a single BOP we found that aberrantly phosphorylated tau rapidly accumulated in perivascular domains, but cleared within four hours, suggesting it was removed from the perivascular area, degraded, and/or dephosphorylated. Taken together these findings argue that mild blast exposure causes an evolving CNS insult that is initiated by discrete disturbances of vascular function, thereby setting the stage for more protracted and more widespread neuroinflammatory responses.

When chronically silenced, cortical and hippocampal neurons homeostatically upregulate excitatory synaptic function. However, the subcellular position of such changes on the dendritic tree is not clear. We exploited the cable-filtering properties of dendrites to derive a parameter, the dendritic filtering index (DFI), to map the spatial distribution of synaptic currents. Our analysis indicates that young rat cortical neurons globally scale AMPA receptor-mediated currents, while mature hippocampal neurons do not, revealing distinct homeostatic strategies between brain regions and developmental stages. The DFI presents a useful tool for mapping the dendritic origin of synaptic currents and the location of synaptic plasticity changes.

AB  - Abstract
The recombinant C-terminal domain of tetanus toxin (Hc-TeTx) is a new non-toxic peptide of the tetanus toxin that exerts a protective action against glutamate excitotoxicity in motoneurons. Moreover, its efficacy as a neuroprotective agent has been demonstrated in several animal models of neurodegeneration. The eleven amino acids in the β amyloid peptide (Aβ25–35) mimic the toxic effects of the full β amyloid peptide (Aβ1–42), causing the impairment of the cholinergic system in the medial septum (MS) which, in turn, alters the septo-hippocampal pathway and leads to learning and memory impairments. The aim of this study was to examine the neuroprotective effects of the Hc-TeTx fragment against cholinotoxicity. The Hc-TeTx fragment (100 ng) was injected into the rats intercranially, with the Aβ(25–35) (2 μg) then injected into their MS. The animals were tested for spatial learning and memory in the eight-arm radial maze. The brains were removed to assess cholinergic markers, such as choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and to explore neurodegeneration in the MS and hippocampus, using amino-cupric silver and H&amp;E staining. Finally, capase-3, a marker of apoptosis, was examined in the MS. Our results clearly demonstrate that the application of Hc-TeTx prevents the loss of cholinergic markers (ChAT and AChE), the activation of capase-3, and neurodegeneration in the MS and the CA1 and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus. All these improvements were reflected in spatial learning and memory performance, and were significantly higher compared with animals treated with Aβ(25–35). Interestingly, the single administration of Hc-TeTx into the MS modified the ChAT and AChE expression that affect cognitive processes, without inducing neurodegeneration or an increase in capase-3 expression in the MS and hippocampus. In summary, our findings suggest that the recombinant Hc-TeTx fragment offers effective protection for the septo-hippocampal pathway, given that it reduces the neurodegeneration caused by Aβ(25–35) and improves learning and memory processes.

AB  - Abstract
We propose that the extracellular matrix (ECM) signals CD44, a hyaluronan receptor, to increase the responsiveness to mechanical stimulation in the rat hind paw. We report that intradermal injection of hyaluronidase induces mechanical hyperalgesia, that is inhibited by co-administration of a CD44 receptor antagonist, A5G27. The intradermal injection of low (LMWH) but not high (HMWH) molecular weight hyaluronan also induces mechanical hyperalgesia, an effect that was attenuated by pretreatment with HMWH or A5G27. Pretreatment with HMWH also attenuated the hyperalgesia induced by hyaluronidase. Similarly, intradermal injection of A6, a CD44 receptor agonist, produced hyperalgesia that was inhibited by HMWH and A5G27. Inhibitors of protein kinase A (PKA) and Src, but not protein kinase C (PKC), significantly attenuated the hyperalgesia induced by both A6 and LMWH. Finally, to determine if CD44 receptor signaling is involved in a preclinical model of inflammatory pain, we evaluated the effect of A5G27 and HMWH on the mechanical hyperalgesia associated with the inflammation induced by carrageenan. Both A5G27 and HMWH attenuated carrageenan-induced mechanical hyperalgesia. Thus, while LMWH acts at its cognate receptor, CD44, to induce mechanical hyperalgesia, HMWH acts at the same receptor as an antagonist. That the local administration of HMWH or A5G27 inhibits carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia supports the suggestion that carrageenan produces changes in the ECM that contributes to inflammatory pain. These studies define a clinically relevant role for signaling by the hyaluronan receptor, CD44, in increased responsiveness to mechanical stimulation.

AB  - Abstract
After limb amputation, patients often wake up with a vivid perception of the presence of the missing limb, called “phantom limb”. Phantom limbs have mostly been studied with respect to pain sensation. But patients can experience many other phantom sensations, including voluntary movements. The goal of the present study was to quantify phantom movement kinematics and relate these to intact limb kinematics and to the time elapsed since amputation. Six upper arm and two forearm amputees with various delays since amputation (6 months to 32 years) performed phantom finger, hand and wrist movements at self-chosen comfortable velocities. The kinematics of the phantom movements was indirectly obtained via the intact limb that synchronously mimicked the phantom limb movements, using a Cyberglove® for measuring finger movements and an inertial measurement unit for wrist movements. Results show that the execution of phantom movements is perceived as “natural” but effortful. The types of phantom movements that can be performed are variable between the patients but they could all perform thumb flexion/extension and global hand opening/closure. Finger extension movements appeared to be 24% faster than finger flexion movements. Neither the number of types of phantom movements that can be executed nor the kinematic characteristics were related to the elapsed time since amputation, highlighting the persistence of post-amputation neural adaptation. We hypothesize that the perceived slowness of phantom movements is related to altered proprioceptive feedback that cannot be recalibrated by lack of visual feedback during phantom movement execution.

AB  - Abstract
Here we report the involvement of N-Methyl-d-Aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA glutamate receptors from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) in the mediation of cardiovascular changes observed during hemorrhage and post-bleeding periods. In addition, the present study provides further evidence of the involvement of circulating vasopressin and cardiac sympathetic activity in cardiovascular responses to hemorrhage. Systemic treatment with the V1-vasopressin receptor antagonist dTyr(CH2)5(Me)AVP (50 μg/kg, i.v.) increased the latency to the onset of hypotension during hemorrhage and slowed post-bleeding recovery of blood pressure. Systemic treatment with the β1-adrenergic receptor antagonist atenolol (1 mg/kg, i.v.) also increased the latency to the onset of hypotension during hemorrhage. Moreover, atenolol reversed the hemorrhage-induced tachycardia into bradycardia. Bilateral microinjection of the selective NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist LY235959 (2 nmol/100 nL) into the PVN blocked the hypotensive response to hemorrhage and reduced the tachycardia during the post-hemorrhage period. Systemic treatment with dTyr(CH2)5(Me)AVP inhibited the effect of LY235959 on hemorrhage-induced hypotension, without affecting the post-bleeding tachycardia. PVN treatment with the selective non-NMDA receptor antagonist NBQX (2 nmol/100 nL) reduced the recovery of blood pressure to normal levels in the post-bleeding phase and reduced hemorrhage-induced tachycardia. Combined blockade of both NMDA and non-NMDA glutamate receptors in the PVN completely abolished the hypotensive response in the hemorrhage period and reduced the tachycardiac response in the post-hemorrhage period. These results indicate that local PVN glutamate neurotransmission is involved in the neural pathway mediating cardiovascular responses to hemorrhage, via an integrated control involving autonomic nervous system activity and vasopressin release into the circulation.

AB  - Abstract
The ability to learn is assumed to support successful recovery and rehabilitation therapy after stroke. Hence, learning impairments may reduce the recovery potential. Here, the hypothesis is tested that stroke survivors have deficits in feedback-driven implicit learning. Stroke survivors (n = 30) and healthy age-matched control subjects (n = 21) learned a probabilistic classification task with brain activation measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging in a subset of these individuals (17 stroke and 10 controls). Stroke subjects learned slower than controls to classify cues. After being rewarded with a smiley face, they were less likely to give the same response when the cue was repeated. Stroke subjects showed reduced brain activation in putamen, pallidum, thalamus, frontal and prefrontal cortices and cerebellum when compared with controls. Lesion analysis identified those stroke survivors as learning-impaired who had lesions in frontal areas, putamen, thalamus, caudate and insula. Lesion laterality had no effect on learning efficacy or brain activation. These findings suggest that stroke survivors have deficits in reinforcement learning that may be related to dysfunctional processing of feedback-based decision-making, reward signals and working memory.

AB  - Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic degenerative disorder characterized by fibrillary aggregates of Aß and Tau-protein. Formation and progression of these pathological hallmarks throughout the brain follow a specific spatio-temporal pattern which provides the basis for neuropathological staging. Previously, we could demonstrate that cortical and subcortical neurons are less frequently affected by neurofibrillary degeneration if they are enwrapped by a specialized form of the hyaluronan-based extracellular matrix (ECM), the so called ‘perineuronal net’ (PN). PNs are composed of large aggregating chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans connected to a hyaluronan backbone, stabilized by link proteins and cross-linked via tenascin-R. Recently, PN-associated neurons were shown to be better protected against iron-induced neurodegeneration compared to neurons without PN, indicating a neuroprotective function. Here, we investigated the role of PNs in distribution and internalization of exogenous Tau-protein by using organotypic slice cultures of wildtype mice as well as mice lacking the ECM-components aggrecan, HAPLN1 or tenascin-R. We could demonstrate that PNs restrict both distribution and internalization of Tau. Accordingly, PN-ensheathed neurons were less frequently affected by Tau-internalization, than neurons without PN.

Finally, the PNs as well as their three investigated components were shown to modulate the processes of distribution as well as internalization of Tau.

AB  - Abstract
Transplantation of peripheral glia is being trialled for neural repair therapies, and identification of compounds that enhance the activity of glia is therefore of therapeutic interest. We have previously shown that curcumin potently stimulates the activity of olfactory glia. We have now examined the effect of curcumin on Schwann cell (SC) activities including proliferation, migration and the expression of protein markers. SCs were treated with control media and with different concentrations of curcumin (0.02–20 μM). Cell proliferation was determined by MTS assay and migration changes were determined by single live cell migration tracking. We found that small doses of curcumin (40 nM) dramatically increased the proliferation and migration in SCs within just one day. When compared with olfactory glia, curcumin stimulated SC proliferation more rapidly and at lower concentrations. Curcumin significantly increased the migration of SCs, and also increased the dynamic activity of lamellipodial waves which are essential for SC migration. Expression of the activated form of the MAP kinase p38 (p-p38) was significantly decreased in curcumin-treated SCs. These results show that curcumin’s effects on SCs differ remarkably to its effects on olfactory glia, suggesting that subtypes of closely related glia can be differentially stimulated by curcumin. Overall these results demonstrate that the therapeutically beneficial activities of glia can be differentially enhanced by curcumin which could be used to improve outcomes of neural repair therapies.

AB  - Abstract
We previously characterized the organization of presympathetic-premotor neurons (PSPMNs), which send descending poly-synaptic projections with collaterals to skeletal muscle and the adrenal gland. Such neurons may play a role in shaping integrated adaptive responses, and many of them were found within well-characterized regions of noradrenergic cell populations suggesting that some of the PSPMNs are catecholaminergic. To address this issue, we used retrograde trans-synaptic tract-tracing with attenuated pseudorabies virus (PRV) recombinants combined with multi-label immunofluorescence to identify PSPMNs expressing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Our findings indicate that TH-immunoreactive (ir) PSPMNs are present throughout the brainstem within multiple cell populations, including the A1, C1, C2, C3, A5 and A7 cell groups along with the locus coeruleus (LC) and the nucleus subcoeruleus (SubC). The largest numbers of TH-ir PSPMNs were located within the LC and SubC. Within SubC and the A7 cell group, about 70% of TH-ir neurons were PSPMNs, which was a significantly greater fraction of neurons than in the other brain regions we examined. These findings indicate that TH-ir neurons near the pontomesencephalic junction that are distributed across the LC, SubC, and the A7 may play a prominent role in somatomotor–sympathetic integration, and that the major functional role of the A7 and SubC noradrenergic cell groups maybe in the coordination of concomitant activation of somatomotor and sympathetic outflows. These neurons may participate in mediating homeostatic adaptations that require simultaneous activation of sympathetic and somatomotor nerves in the periphery.

AB  - Abstract
Tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome (TS), are thought to involve pathology of cortico-basal ganglia loops, but their pathology is not well understood. Post-mortem studies have shown a reduced number of several populations of striatal interneurons, including the parvalbumin-expressing fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs), in individuals with severe, refractory TS. We tested the causal role of this interneuronal deficit by recapitulating it in an otherwise normal adult mouse using a combination transgenic-viral cell ablation approach. FSIs were reduced bilaterally by ∼40%, paralleling the deficit found post-mortem. This did not produce spontaneous stereotypies or tic-like movements, but there was increased stereotypic grooming after acute stress in two validated paradigms. Stereotypy after amphetamine, in contrast, was not elevated. FSI ablation also led to increased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze, but not to alterations in motor learning on the rotorod or to alterations in prepulse inhibition, a measure of sensorimotor gating. These findings indicate that a striatal FSI deficit can produce stress-triggered repetitive movements and anxiety. These repetitive movements may recapitulate aspects of the pathophysiology of tic disorders.

AB  - Abstract
In violent video games, players engage in virtual aggressive behaviors. Exposure to virtual aggressive behavior induces short-term changes in players’ behavior. In a previous study, a violence-related version of the racing game “Carmageddon TDR2000” increased aggressive affects, cognitions, and behaviors compared to its non-violence-related version. This study investigates the differences in neural network activity during the playing of both versions of the video game.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recorded ongoing brain activity of 18 young men playing the violence-related and the non-violence-related version of the video game Carmageddon. Image time series were decomposed into functional connectivity (FC) patterns using independent component analysis (ICA) and template-matching yielded a mapping to established functional brain networks.

The FC patterns revealed a decrease in connectivity within 6 brain networks during the violence-related compared to the non-violence-related condition: three sensory-motor networks, the reward network, the default mode network (DMN), and the right-lateralized frontoparietal network.

Playing violent racing games may change functional brain connectivity, in particular and even after controlling for event frequency, in the reward network and the DMN. These changes may underlie the short-term increase of aggressive affects, cognitions, and behaviors as observed after playing violent video games.

AB  - Abstract
There is increasing evidence to suggest that essential tremor has a central origin. Different structures appear to be part of the central tremorogenic network, including the motor cortex, the thalamus and the cerebellum. Some studies using electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) show linear association in the tremor frequency between the motor cortex and the contralateral tremor electromyography (EMG). Additionally, high thalamomuscular coherence is found with the use of thalamic local field potential (LFP) recordings and tremulous EMG in patients undergoing surgery for deep brain stimulation (DBS). Despite a well-established reciprocal anatomical connection between the thalamus and cortex, the functional association between the two structures during “tremor-on” periods remains elusive. Thalamic (Vim) LFPs, ipsilateral scalp EEG from the sensorimotor cortex and contralateral tremor arm EMG recordings were obtained from two patients with essential tremor who had undergone successful surgery for DBS. Coherence analysis shows a strong linear association between thalamic LFPs and contralateral tremor EMG, but the relationship between the EEG and the thalamus is much less clear. These measurements were then analyzed by constructing a novel parametric nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) model. This new approach uncovered two distinct and not overlapping frequency “channels” of communication between Vim thalamus and the ipsilateral motor cortex, defining robustly “tremor-on” versus “tremor-off” states. The associated estimated nonlinear time lags also showed non-overlapping values between the two states, with longer corticothalamic lags (exceeding 50 ms) in the tremor active state, suggesting involvement of an indirect multisynaptic loop. The results reveal the importance of the nonlinear interactions between cortical and subcortical areas in the central motor network of essential tremor. This work is important because it demonstrates for the first time that in essential tremor the functional interrelationships between the cortex and thalamus should not be sought exclusively within individual frequencies but more importantly between cross-frequency nonlinear interactions. Should our results be successfully reproduced on a bigger cohort of patients with essential tremor, our approach could be used to create an on-demand closed-loop DBS device, able to automatically activate when the tremor is on.

AB  - Abstract
The sudden interruption of the increase of the concentration of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), determines an increase in neuronal activity. GABA withdrawal (GW) is a heuristic analogy, with withdrawal symptoms developed by other GABA receptor-agonists such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, and neurosteroids. GW comprises a model of neuronal excitability validated by electroencephalogram (EEG) in which high-frequency and high-amplitude spike–wave complexes appear. In brain slices, GW was identified by increased firing synchronization of pyramidal neurons and by changes in the active properties of the neuronal membrane. GW induces pre- and postsynaptic changes: a decrease in GABA synthesis/release, and the decrease in the expression and composition of GABAA receptors associated with increased calcium entry into the cell.

GW is an excellent bioassay for studying partial epilepsy, epilepsy refractory to drug treatment, and a model to reverse or prevent the generation of abstinences from different drugs.

Motor, sensory, and autonomic abnormalities are reported for toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) knock-out (KO) mice. However, a physiological role of TLR9 in the nervous system is largely unknown. Since altered synaptic transmission can contribute to sensory and motor abnormalities, we evaluated neuromuscular junction (NMJ) function and morphology of TLR9 KO mice. Triangularis sterni nerve-muscle preparations were dissected from TLR9 KO and age-matched control mice. Two-electrode voltage clamp of the motor endplate revealed that the amplitude and frequency of miniature end plate currents (mEPCs) for TLR9 KO NMJs were significantly greater than control. In contrast, mean endplate current (EPC, 1 Hz) amplitude was equivalent to control. The ratio of mean EPC to mean mEPC amplitude indicated a decline of quantal content (m) for TLR9 KO NMJs. Furthermore, m declined more rapidly than control in response to 50-Hz stimulus trains. A rightward shift of the mEPC amplitude distribution suggested formation of vesicles containing larger amounts of acetylcholine (ACh). Staining with rhodamine α-bungarotoxin revealed a significant decline of endplate size in TLR9 KO mice. This alteration may result from ACh-induced decline of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) expression resulting from increased frequency and amplitude of mEPCs. At the same time, excessive spontaneous vesicular ACh release may initiate retrograde suppression of excitation-secretion coupling. These data suggest a novel role of TLR9 in the development of the NMJ.

AB  - Abstract
We previously reported that rolling Nagoya mice carrying a mutation in the α1 subunit of the Cav2.1 channel protective from ischemia- and kainate-induced neuronal damage. However, the protective effect of this mutation and its relationship to brain injury recovery have not been examined. To examine the relationship between Cav2.1 channel function and brain injury, we induced cryogenic brain damage in homozygous rolling Nagoya (rol/rol), control wild-type (+/+), ω-agatoxin IVA-pretreated +/+ (ω-aga +/+), and ω-agatoxin IVA-post-treated +/+ (ω-aga-post-treated +/+) mice. We measured the lesion area, blood brain–barrier permeability and performed immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. The lesions of rol/rol and ω-aga +/+ mice were significantly smaller than those observed in +/+ mice at both day 1 and day 7 after injury. Similar results were shown in blood–brain barrier permeability. We observed more reactive astrogliosis in +/+ mice than in rol/rol or ω-aga +/+ mice. rol/rol and ω-aga +/+ mice had fewer degenerating cells due to cryogenic injury than did +/+ mice at both day 1 and day 7. ω-Aga-post-treated +/+ mice 24 h after injury were sacrificed on day 7. The lesions were smaller in ω-aga-post-treated +/+ mice than those in vehicle-treated +/+ mice. We also examined phosphorylated p38 (pp38) at the injured site. ω-Aga-post-treated +/+ mouse brain slices showed weak pp38 signal; vehicle-treated +/+ mouse brain slices were pp38-positive. These findings demonstrate that the mutant Cav2.1 channel exerts a protective effect against cryogenic brain injury in rolling Nagoya mice. Our results indicate that inhibitors of the Cav2.1-dependent p38 signaling cascade would be useful as therapeutic agents in the treatment of brain injury.

Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) encompass a wide range of disorders characterized by inborn errors of lysosomal function. The majority of LSDs result from genetic defects in lysosomal enzymes, although some arise from mutations in lysosomal proteins that lack known enzymatic activity. Neuropathological abnormalities are a feature of several LSDs and when severe, represent an important determinant in disease outcome. Glial dysfunction, particularly in astrocytes, is also observed in numerous LSDs and has been suggested to impact neurodegeneration. This review will discuss the potential role of astrocytes in LSDs and highlight the possibility of targeting glia as a beneficial strategy to counteract the neuropathology associated with LSDs.

AB  - Abstract
The weaver mouse, is a phenocopy of Parkinson’s disease (PD) in which dopaminergic neurons degenerate gradually during development, reaching at P21 a neurodegeneration of 55%. Thus, the weaver mouse constitutes an appropriate in vivo PD model for investigating the effect of neuroprotective agents. In the present study, long-term treatment (from P1 to P21) with 17β-estradiol (17β-estradiol) significantly protected the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) of weaver mouse by 54%, as was detected by immunohistochemical experiments, using the specific antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). This dopaminergic neuroprotection is in line with our biochemical results showing that 17β-estradiol treatment significantly decreased the high lipid peroxidation levels seen in the SN of weaver mouse, indicating high oxidative stress. Interestingly, co-administration of 17β-estradiol with N-acetylcysteine (NAC, precursor molecule of glutathione (GSH)) further significantly increased the survival of dopaminergic neurons in the SN (by 85%), with a parallel further decrease of lipid peroxidation to normal levels. Our results show the in vivo neuroprotective effect of 17β-estradiol, which is strongly enhanced by co administration of NAC, indicating a strong synergistic effect of the two drugs. Furthermore, the main mechanism underlying this neuroprotective action seems to be the reversal of the oxidative stress shown by the high peroxidation levels. These results could be of clinical relevance since both drugs are already used separately in the clinic, 17β-estradiol for treatment of PD and NAC as a mucolytic agent and for the treatment of several disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Huntington’s disease (HD) is neurologically characterized by involuntary movements, associated with degeneration of the medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs) and ubiquitin-positive neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NIIs). It has been reported that the proteolytic activities of the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) are generally inhibited in HD patient’s brain. We previously discovered that a proteasome activator (PA), PA28γ enhances proteasome activities and cell survival in in vitro HD model. In this study, we aimed to find whether PA28γ gene transfer improves the proteasome activities and pathological symptoms in in vivo HD model. We stereotaxically injected lenti-PA28γ virus into the striatum of mutant (MT) YAC128 HD mice and littermate (LM) controls at 14–18 months of age, and validated their behavioral and biochemical changes at 12 weeks after the injection. YAC128 mice showed a significant increase in their peptidyl-glutamyl preferring hydrolytic (PGPH) proteasome activity and the mRNA or protein levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and pro-BDNF after lenti-PA28γ injection. The number of ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies was reduced in the striatum of YAC128 mice after lenti-PA28γ injection. YAC128 mice showed significant improvement of latency to fall on the rota-rod test after lenti-PA28γ injection. These data demonstrate that the gene therapy with PA, PA28γ can improve UPS function as well as behavioral abnormalities in HD model mice.

AB  - Abstract
Following brain ischemia reperfusion (IR), the dramatic increase in adenosine activates A2AR to induce further neuronal damage. Noteworthy, A2A antagonists have proven efficacious in halting IR injury, however, the detailed downstream signaling remains elusive. To this end, the present study aimed to investigate the possible involvement of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK1/2) pathway in mediating protection afforded by the central A2A blockade. Male Wistar rats (250–270 g) subjected to bilateral carotid occlusion for 45 min followed by a 24-h reperfusion period showed increased infarct size corroborating histopathological damage, memory impairment and motor incoordination as well as increased locomotor activity. Those events were mitigated by the unilateral intrahippocampal administration of the selective A2A antagonist SCH58261 via a decrease in pERK1/2 downstream from diacyl glycerol (DAG) signaling. Consequent to pERK1/2 inhibition, reduced hippocampal microglial activation, glial tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) expression, glutamate (Glu), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were evident in animals receiving SCH58261. Additionally, the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) increased following nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf-2). Taken all together, these events suppressed apoptotic pathways via a reduction in cytochrome c (Cyt. c) as well as caspase-3 supporting a crucial role for pERK1/2 inhibition in consequent reduction of inflammatory and excitotoxic cascades as well as correction of the redox imbalance.

AB  - Abstract
In spite of the existence of pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) projections to cerebellar nuclei, their nature and functional role is unknown. These fibers may play a crucial role in postural control and may be involved in the beneficial effects induced by deep-brain stimulation (DBS) of brainstem structures in motor disorders. We investigated the effects of PPTg microstimulation on single-unit activity of dentate, fastigial and interpositus nuclei. The effects of PPTg stimulation were also studied in rats whose PPTg neurons were destroyed by ibotenic acid and subsequently subjected to iontophoretically applied cholinergic antagonists. The main response recorded in cerebellar nuclei was a short-latency (1.5–2 ms) and brief (13–15 ms) orthodromic activation. The dentate nucleus was the most responsive to PPTg stimulation. The destruction of PPTg cells reduced the occurrence of PPTg-evoked activation of dentate neurons, suggesting that the effect was due to stimulation of cell bodies and not due to fibers passing through or close to the PPTg. Application of cholinergic antagonists reduced or eliminated the PPTg-evoked response recorded in the dentate nucleus. The results show that excitation is exerted by the PPTg on the cerebellar nuclei, in particular on the dentate nucleus. Taken together with the reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase-positive neurons in lesioned animals, the iontophoretic experiments suggest that the activation of dentate neurons is due to cholinergic fibers. These data help to explain the effects of DBS of the PPTg on axial motor disabilities in neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Nucleobindin 1 (NUCB1; also known as CALNUC or NUC) is a putative DNA- and calcium-binding protein and exhibits significant structural homology with the protein nucleobindin 2 (NUCB2; also known as nesfatin). While NUCB2 has been mapped in detail in the brain and implicated in the hypothalamic control of energy metabolism, no study has to date addressed the presence of NUCB1 in the central nervous system. Here we have explored the expression and distribution of NUCB1 in the rat brain and spinal cord, using RT-PCR, immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization.

NUCB1 mRNA and protein was found to be present in all brain regions, extending to the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia. Double-staining for NUCB1 and NeuN, glial fibrillary acidic protein and myelin basic protein revealed that NUCB1 is exclusively found in neurons, and not in glial or ependymal cells. Notably, NUCB1-immunoreactivity was observed in all neurons examined, making no distinction between previously identified glutamatergic and GABAergic populations, including those that are known not to stain for NeuN. This included the markedly more restricted population of NUCB2-expressing neurons in the brain. The protein was detected in cell somata and proximal dendrites, but not in axons or terminal structures. Further examination of the subcellular distribution of NUCB1 using organelle-specific markers revealed its consistent presence in the Golgi apparatus.

These findings identify NUCB1 as a novel pan-neuronal marker. Along with the recent demonstration of broad expression of the protein in endocrine cells, the present results suggest that NUCB1 may play a role in spatiotemporal calcium handling in signaling cells.

AB  - Abstract
Methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPSS) has been proposed as a first-line treatment for acute spinal cord injury (SCI). Its clinical use remains, however, controversial because of the modest benefits and numerous side-effects. We investigated if MPSS could protect spinal neurons and glia using an in vitro model of the rat spinal cord that enables recording reflexes, fictive locomotion and morphological analysis of damage. With this model, a differential lesion affecting mainly either neurons or glia can be produced via kainate-evoked excitotoxicity or application of a pathological medium (lacking O2 and glucose), respectively. MPSS (6–10 μM) applied for 24 h after 1-h pathological medium protected astrocytes and oligodendrocytes especially in the ventrolateral white matter. This effect was accompanied by the return of slow, alternating oscillations (elicited by NMDA and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) reminiscent of a sluggish fictive locomotor pattern. MPSS was, however, unable to reverse even a moderate neuronal loss and the concomitant suppression of fictive locomotion evoked by kainate (0.1 mM; 1 h). These results suggest that MPSS could, at least in part, contrast damage to spinal glia induced by a dysmetabolic state (associated to oxygen and glucose deprivation) and facilitate reactivation of spinal networks. Conversely, when even a minority of neurons was damaged by excitotoxicity, MPSS did not protect them nor did it restore network function in the current experimental model.

AB  - Abstract
Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) regulate development and maintenance, and reduce vulnerability of neurons. FGF-2 is essential for survival of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons and is responsible for their dysplasia and disease-related degeneration. We previously reported that FGF-2 is involved in adequate forebrain (FB) target innervation by these neurons in an organotypic co-culture model. It remains unclear, how this ex-vivo phenotype relates to the in vivo situation, and which FGF-related signaling pathway is involved in this process. Here, we demonstrate that lack of FGF-2 results in an increased volume of the striatal target area in mice. We further add evidence that the low molecular weight (LMW) FGF-2 isoform is responsible for this phenotype, as this isoform is predominantly expressed in the embryonic ventral midbrain (VM) as well as in postnatal striatum (STR) and known to act via canonical transmembrane FGF receptor (FGFR) activation. Additionally, we confirm that the phenotype with an enlarged FB-target area by DA neurons can be mimicked in an ex-vivo explant model by inhibiting the canonical FGFR signaling, which resulted in decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, while AKT activation remained unchanged.

AB  - Abstract
Our recent study has indicated that a moderate lesion induced by bilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injections into the ventrolateral region of the caudate-putamen (CP) in rats, modeling preclinical stages of Parkinson’s disease, induces a “depressive-like” behavior which is reversed by chronic treatment with pramipexole (PRA).

The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of the above lesion and chronic PRA treatment on binding to the serotonin transporter (SERT) in different brain regions. As before, 6-OHDA (15 μg/2.5 μl) was administered bilaterally into the CP. PRA (1 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously twice a day for 2 weeks. Serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons of the dorsal raphe (DR) were immunostained for tryptophan hydroxylase and tyrosine hydroxylase, respectively, and were counted stereologically. Binding of [3H]GBR 12,935 to the dopamine transporter (DAT) and [3H]citalopram to SERT was analyzed autoradiographically. Intrastriatal 6-OHDA injections decreased the number of dopaminergic, but not serotonergic neurons in the DR. 6-OHDA reduced the DAT binding in the CP, and SERT binding in the nigrostriatal system (CP, substantia nigra (SN)), limbic system (ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAC), amygdala, prefrontal cortex (PFCX), habenula, hippocampus) and DR. A significant positive correlation was found between DAT and SERT binding in the CP. Chronic PRA did not influence DAT binding but reduced SERT binding in the above structures, and deepened the lesion-induced losses in the core region of the NAC, SN, VTA and PFCX.

The present study indicates that both the lesion of dopaminergic neurons and chronic PRA administration induce adaptive down-regulation of SERT binding. Moreover, although involvement of stimulation of dopaminergic transmission by chronic PRA in its “antidepressant” effect seems to be prevalent, additional contribution of SERT inhibition cannot be excluded.

AB  - Abstract
Cognitive deficits and psychotic symptoms are highly prevalent in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Imaging studies in humans have suggested that these comorbidities are associated with atrophy in temporal lobe structures and other limbic regions. It remains to be clarified whether TLE comorbidities are due to the frequency of spontaneous seizures or to limbic structural damage per se. Here, we used the pilocarpine model of chronic spontaneous seizures to evaluate the possible association of seizure frequency with sensorimotor gating, spatial working memory, and neuropathology throughout limbic regions. For TLE modeling, we induced a 2-h status epilepticus by the systemic administration of lithium–pilocarpine. Once spontaneous seizures were established, we tested the locomotor activity (open field), spatial working memory (eight-arm radial maze), and sensorimotor gating (prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle). After behavioral testing, the brains were sectioned for hematoxylin–eosin staining (cell density) and parvalbumin immunohistochemistry (GABAergic neuropil) in the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex. The animal groups analyzed included chronic epileptic rats, their controls, and rats that received lithium–pilocarpine but eventually failed to express status epilepticus or spontaneous seizures. Epileptic rats showed deficits in sensorimotor gating that negatively correlated with the radial maze performance, and impairments in both behavioral tests correlated with seizure frequency. In addition to neuronal loss at several sites, we found increased parvalbumin immunostaining in the prefrontal cortex (infralimbic area), thalamus (midline and reticular nuclei), amygdala, Ammon’s horn, dentate gyrus, and entorhinal cortex. These tissue changes correlated with seizure frequency and impairments in sensorimotor gating. Our work indicates that chronic seizures might impact the inhibitory–excitatory balance in the temporal lobe and its interconnected limbic regions, which could increase the likelihood of cognitive deficits and interictal psychiatric disorders.

Afferent connections to the sensory inner (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs) in the cochlea refine and functionally mature during the thyroid hormone (TH)-critical period of inner ear development that occurs perinatally in rodents. In this study, we investigated the effects of hypothyroidism on afferent type II innervation to outer hair cells using the Snell dwarf mouse (Pit1dw). Using a transgenic approach to specifically label type II spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), we found that lack of TH causes persistence of excess type II SGN connections to the OHCs, as well as continued expression of the hair cell functional marker, otoferlin (OTOF), in the OHCs beyond the maturation period. We also observed a concurrent delay in efferent attachment to the OHCs. Supplementing with TH during the early postnatal period from postnatal day (P) 3 to P4 reversed the defect in type II SGN pruning but did not alter OTOF expression. Our results show that hypothyroidism causes a defect in the large-scale pruning of afferent type II SGNs in the cochlea, and a delay in efferent attachment and the maturation of OTOF expression. Our data suggest that the state of maturation of hair cells, as determined by OTOF expression, may not regulate the pruning of their afferent innervation.

AB  - Abstract
The effects of a ketogenic diet in controlling seizure activity have been proven in many studies, although its mechanism of action remains elusive in many regards. We hypothesize that the ketogenic diet may exert its antiepileptic effects by influencing tryptophan (TRP) metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of octanoic and decanoic fatty acids (FAs), the main components in the MCT diet (medium-chain triglyceride diet, a subtype of the ketogenic diet), on the metabolism of TRP, the activity of the kynurenic pathway and the concentrations of monoamines and amino acids, including branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and aromatic amino acids (AAA) in rats. The acute effects of FA on the sedation index and hippocampal electrical after-discharge threshold were also assessed.

We observed that intragastric administration of FA increased the brain levels of TRP and the central and peripheral concentrations of kynurenic acid (KYNA), as well as caused significant changes in the brain and plasma concentrations of BCAA and AAA. We found that the administration of FA clearly increased the seizure threshold and induced sedation. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that blocking TRP passage into the brain abolished these effects of FA but had no similar effect on the formation of ketone bodies. Given that FAs are major components of a ketogenic diet, it is suggested that the anticonvulsant effects of a ketogenic diet may be at least partly dependent on changes in TRP metabolism. We also propose a more general hypothesis concerning the intracellular mechanism of the ketogenic diet.

AB  - Abstract
In motor neuron diseases, there is a prolonged period of time before any clinical symptoms begin to appear. During this time, distal axonal degeneration, or “dying back” axonopathy, begins to occur before the onset of clinical symptoms and motor neuron death. This preclinical degeneration is a hallmark of motor neuron diseases in both animal models and human patients. Generally, in muscles with mixed fiber types, distal degeneration occurs in fast-fatigable α-motor axons innervating type IIb muscle fibers before axons innervating slow, type I muscle fibers. We investigated whether the “dying back” axonopathy in a pure fast-fatigable α-motor axon nerve is a length-dependent process. The lateral thoracic nerve (LTN) exclusively consists of motor nerves that innervate the very thin cutaneous maximus muscle (CMM) that solely contains type II neuromuscular synapses. We characterized the LTN and CMM synapses both morphologically and physiologically in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mutant mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). By 60 days of age, there was a significant “dying back” phenomenon at the caudal region while the rostral region remained intact. The longer axons innervating the caudal region appear to be more susceptible to degeneration in the SOD1 mouse indicating that the axonal degeneration of motor neurons innervating type II fibers is a length-dependent process. Additionally, we identified how the simplicity of the LTN–CMM system offers a better method to investigate axon degeneration in an ALS mouse model and may be used to investigate possible therapeutic compounds for axon protection and regeneration.

AB  - Abstract
The brain possesses two intricate mechanisms that fulfill its continuous metabolic needs: cerebral autoregulation, which ensures constant cerebral blood flow over a wide range of arterial pressures and functional hyperemia, which ensures rapid delivery of oxygen and glucose to active neurons. Over the past decade, a number of important studies have identified astrocytes as key intermediaries in neurovascular coupling (NVC), the mechanism by which active neurons signal blood vessels to change their diameter. Activity-dependent increases in astrocytic Ca2+ activity are thought to contribute to the release of vasoactive substances that facilitate arteriole vasodilation. A number of vasoactive signals have been identified and their role on vessel caliber assessed both in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we discuss mechanisms implicating astrocytes in NVC-mediated vascular responses, limitations encountered as a result of the challenges in maintaining all the constituents of the neurovascular unit intact and deliberate current controversial findings disputing a main role for astrocytes in NVC. Finally, we briefly discuss the potential role of pericytes and microglia in NVC-mediated processes.

AB  - Abstract
Amphetamine (AMPH) exposure leads to changes in behavior and dopamine receptor function in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Since dopamine plays an important role in regulating GABAergic transmission in the PFC, we investigated if AMPH exposure induces long-lasting changes in dopamine’s ability to modulate inhibitory transmission in the PFC as well as whether the effects of AMPH differed depending on the age of exposure. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were given saline or 3 mg/kg AMPH (i.p.) repeatedly during adolescence or adulthood and following a withdrawal period of up to 5 weeks (Experiment 1) or up to 14 weeks (Experiment 2), they were sacrificed for in vitro whole-cell recordings in layer V/VI of the medial PFC. We found that in brain slices from either adolescent- or adult-exposed rats, there was an attenuation of dopamine-induced increases in inhibitory synaptic currents in pyramidal cells. These effects did not depend on age of exposure, were mediated at least partially by a reduced sensitivity of D1 receptors in AMPH-treated rats, and were associated with an enhanced behavioral response to the drug in a separate group of rats given an AMPH challenge following the longest withdrawal period. Together, these data reveal a prolonged effect of AMPH exposure on medial PFC function that persisted for up to 14 weeks in adolescent-exposed animals. These long-lasting neurophysiological changes may be a contributing mechanism to the behavioral consequences that have been observed in those with a history of amphetamine abuse.

AB  - Abstract
Huntington’s disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a constellation of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric features. Striatal medium spiny neurons, one of the most affected populations, are dependent on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) anterogradely transported from the cortex for proper function and survival. Recent studies suggest both receptors for BDNF, TrkB and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75), are improperly regulated in the striata of HD patients and mouse models of HD. While BDNF–TrkB signaling almost exclusively promotes survival and metabolic function, p75 signaling is able to induce survival or apoptosis depending on the available ligand and associated co-receptor. We investigated the role of p75 in the Q175 knock-in mouse model of HD by examining the levels and activation of downstream signaling molecules, and subsequently examining Hdh+/Q175;p75−/− mice to determine if p75 represents a promising therapeutic target. In Hdh+/Q175;p75+/+ mice, we observed enhanced survival signaling as evidenced by an increase in phosphorylation and activation of Akt and the p65 subunit of NFκB in the striatum at 5 months of age and an increase in XIAP expression compared to Hdh+/+;p75+/+ mice; this increase was lost in Hdh+/Q175;p75−/− mice. Hdh+/Q175;p75−/− mice also showed a decrease in Bcl-XL expression by immunoblotting compared to Hdh+/Q175;p75+/+ and Hdh+/+;p75+/+ littermates. Consistent with diminished survival signaling, DARPP-32 expression decreased both by immunoblotting and by immunohistochemistry in Hdh+/Q175;p75−/− mice compared to Hdh+/+;p75+/+, Hdh+/Q175;p75+/+, and Hdh+/+;p75−/− littermates. Additionally, striatal volume declined to a greater extent in Hdh+/Q175;p75−/− when compared to Hdh+/Q175;p75+/+ littermates at 12 months, indicating a more aggressive onset of degeneration. These data suggest that p75 signaling plays an early role in augmenting pro-survival signaling in the striatum and that disruption of p75 signaling at a pre-symptomatic age may exacerbate pathologic changes in Hdh+/Q175 mice.

AB  - Abstract
Previous studies often report that early auditory deprivation or congenital deafness contributes to cross-modal reorganization in the auditory-deprived cortex, and this cross-modal reorganization limits clinical benefit from cochlear prosthetics. However, there are inconsistencies among study results on cortical reorganization in those subjects with long-term unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (USNHL). It is also unclear whether there exists a similar cross-modal plasticity of the auditory cortex for acquired monaural deafness and early or congenital deafness. To address this issue, we constructed the directional brain functional networks based on entropy connectivity of resting-state functional MRI and researched changes of the networks. Thirty-four long-term USNHL individuals and seventeen normally hearing individuals participated in the test, and all USNHL patients had acquired deafness. We found that certain brain regions of the sensorimotor and visual networks presented enhanced synchronous output entropy connectivity with the left primary auditory cortex in the left long-term USNHL individuals as compared with normally hearing individuals. Especially, the left USNHL showed more significant changes of entropy connectivity than the right USNHL. No significant plastic changes were observed in the right USNHL. Our results indicate that the left primary auditory cortex (non-auditory-deprived cortex) in patients with left USNHL has been reorganized by visual and sensorimotor modalities through cross-modal plasticity. Furthermore, the cross-modal reorganization also alters the directional brain functional networks. The auditory deprivation from the left or right side generates different influences on the human brain.

AB  - Abstract
Inter-alpha Inhibitor Proteins (IAIPs) are a family of related serine protease inhibitors. IAIPs are important components of the systemic innate immune system. We have identified endogenous IAIPs in the central nervous system (CNS) of sheep during development and shown that treatment with IAIPs reduces neuronal cell death and improves behavioral outcomes in neonatal rats after hypoxic–ischemic brain injury. The presence of IAIPs in CNS along with their exogenous neuroprotective properties suggests that endogenous IAIPs could be part of the innate immune system in CNS. The purpose of this study was to characterize expression and localization of IAIPs in CNS. We examined cellular expressions of IAIPs in vitro in cultured cortical mouse neurons, in cultured rat neurons, microglia, and astrocytes, and in vivo on brain sections by immunohistochemistry from embryonic (E) day 18 mice and postnatal (P) day 10 rats. Cultured cortical mouse neurons expressed the light chain gene Ambp and heavy chain genes Itih-1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mRNA transcripts and IAIP proteins. IAIP proteins were detected by immunohistochemistry in cultured cells as well as brain sections from E18 mice and P10 rats. Immunoreactivity was found in neurons, microglia, astrocytes and oligodendroglia in multiple brain regions including cortex and hippocampus, as well as within both the ependyma and choroid plexus. Our findings suggest that IAIPs are endogenous proteins expressed in a wide variety of cell types and regions both in vitro and in vivo in rodent CNS. We speculate that endogenous IAIPs may represent endogenous neuroprotective immunomodulatory proteins within the CNS.

AB  - Abstract
Neurotransmitters released at synapses activate neighboring astrocytes, which in turn, modulate neuronal activity by the release of diverse neuroactive substances that include classical neurotransmitters such as glutamate, GABA or ATP. Neuroactive substances are released from astrocytes through several distinct molecular mechanisms, for example, by diffusion through membrane channels, by translocation via plasmalemmal transporters or by vesicular exocytosis. Vesicular release regulated by a stimulus-mediated increase in cytosolic calcium involves soluble N-ethyl maleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor (SNARE)-dependent merger of the vesicle membrane with the plasmalemma. Up to 25 molecules of synaptobrevin 2 (Sb2), a SNARE complex protein, reside at a single astroglial vesicle; an individual neuronal, i.e. synaptic, vesicle contains ∼70 Sb2 molecules. It is proposed that this paucity of Sb2 molecules in astrocytic vesicles may determine the slow secretion. In the present essay we shall overview multiple aspects of vesicular architecture and types of vesicles based on their cargo and dynamics in astroglial cells.

AB  - Abstract
Previous studies demonstrated that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) transplanted into a subacute contusion injury improve motor, sensory, and bladder function. In this study we tested whether transplanted NPCs can also improve functional recovery after chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) alone or in combination with the reduction of glial scar and neurotrophic support. Adult rats received a T10 moderate contusion. Thirteen weeks after the injury they were divided into four groups and received either: 1. Medium (control), 2. NPC transplants, 3. NPC + lentivirus vector expressing chondroitinase, or 4. NPC + lentivirus vectors expressing chondroitinase and neurotrophic factors. During the 8 weeks post-transplantation the animals were tested for functional recovery and eventually analyzed by anatomical and immunohistochemical assays. The behavioral tests for motor and sensory function were performed before and after injury, and weekly after transplantation, with some animals also tested for bladder function at the end of the experiment. Transplant survival in the chronic injury model was variable and showed NPCs at the injury site in 60% of the animals in all transplantation groups. The NPC transplants comprised less than 40% of the injury site, without significant anatomical or histological differences among the groups. All groups also showed similar patterns of functional deficits and recovery in the 12 weeks after injury and in the 8 weeks after transplantation using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan rating score, the grid test, and the Von Frey test for mechanical allodynia. A notable exception was group 4 (NPC together with chondroitinase and neurotrophins), which showed a significant improvement in bladder function. This study underscores the therapeutic challenges facing transplantation strategies in a chronic SCI in which even the inclusion of treatments designed to reduce scarring and increase neurotrophic support produce only modest functional improvements. Further studies will have to identify the combination of acute and chronic interventions that will augment the survival and efficacy of neural cell transplants.

AB  - Abstract
Repeated exposure to cocaine during adolescence may affect both physical and psychological conditions in the brain, and increase the risk of psychiatric disorders and addiction behaviors in adulthood. Adolescence represents a critical development period for the hippocampus. Moreover, different regions of the hippocampus are involved in different functions. Dorsal hippocampus (dHP) has been implicated in learning and memory, whereas ventral hippocampus (vHP) plays an important role in emotional processing. In this study, the rats that were exposed to cocaine during adolescence (postnatal days, P28–P42) showed higher anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze test in adulthood (P80), but displayed normal spatial learning and memory in the Morris water maze test. Furthermore, repeated exposure to cocaine during adolescence lead to alterations in morphology of pyramidal neurons, activities of astrocytes, and levels of proteins that involved in synaptic transmission, apoptosis, inflammation and addiction in both dHP and vHP of adult rats. These findings suggest that repeated exposure to cocaine during adolescence in rats may elicit morphologic and neurochemical changes in the hippocampus when the animals reach adulthood. These changes may contribute to the increased susceptibility for psychiatric disorders and addiction seen in adults.

AB  - Abstract
The locus coeruleus (LC) has been suggested as a CO2 chemoreceptor site in mammals. Most of the studies involving the role of the LC in hypercapnic ventilatory responses have been performed in males. Since ovarian steroids modulate the activity of LC neurons and females have a different respiratory response to CO2 than males, we evaluated the activity of LC noradrenergic neurons during normocapnia and hypercapnia in female and male rats with distinct sex hormone levels. Ovariectomized (OVX), estradiol (E2)-treated ovariectomized (OVX+E2) and female rats on the diestrous day of the estrous cycle were evaluated. Concurrently, males were investigated as gonad-intact, orchidectomized (ORX), testosterone (T)-treated ORX (ORX+T), and E2-treated ORX (ORX+E2). Activation of LC neurons was determined by double-label immunohistochemistry to c-Fos and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Hypercapnia induced by 7% CO2 increased the number of c-Fos/TH-immunoreactive (ir) neurons in the LC of all groups when compared to air exposure. Hypercapnia-induced c-Fos expression did not differ between diestrous females and intact male rats. In the OVX+E2 group, there was attenuation in the c-Fos expression during normocapnia compared with OVX rats, but CO2 responsiveness was not altered. Moreover, in ORX rats, neither T nor E2 treatments changed c-Fos expression in LC noradrenergic neurons. Thus, in female rats, E2 reduces activation of LC noradrenergic neurons, whereas in males, sex hormones do not influence the LC activity.

AB  - Abstract
Copy number variation at 16p13.11 has been associated with a range of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric conditions, with duplication of this region being more common in individuals with schizophrenia. A prominent candidate gene within this locus is NDE1 (Nuclear Distribution Element 1) given its known importance for neurodevelopment, previous associations with mental illness and its well characterized interaction with the Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) protein. In order to accurately model the effect of NDE1 duplication, it is important to first gain an understanding of how the gene is expressed. The complex promoter system of NDE1, which produces three distinct transcripts, each encoding for the same full-length NDE1 protein (also known as NudE), was therefore cloned and tested in human cell lines. The promoter for the longest of these three NDE1 transcripts was found to be responsible for the majority of expression in these systems, with its extended 5′ untranslated region (UTR) having a limiting effect on its expression. These results thus highlight and clone the promoter elements required to generate systems in which the NDE1 protein is exogenously expressed under its native promoter, providing a biologically relevant model of 16p13.11 duplication in major mental illness.

AB  - Abstract
Over the last thirty years, a growing number of studies showed that astrocytes play a pivotal role in the energy support to synapses. More precisely, astrocytes adjust energy production to neuronal energy needs through different mechanisms grouped under the term “neurometabolic coupling” (NMC). In this review we describe these mechanisms of coupling and how they involve astrocytes. From a physiological point of view, these mechanisms of coupling are particularly important to ensure normal synaptic functioning when neurons undergo rapid and repetitive changes in the firing rate such as during the sleep/wake transitions.

Investigations into brain energy metabolism during the sleep/wake cycle have been mainly focused on glucose (Gluc) consumption and on glycogen metabolism. However, the recent development of substrate-specific biosensors allowed measurements of the variation in extracellular levels of glutamate, Gluc and lactate (Lac) with a time resolution compatible with sleep stage duration. Together with gene expression data these experiments allowed to better define the variations of energy metabolite regulation across the sleep/wake cycle.

The aim of this review is to bring into perspective the role of astrocytes and NMC in the regulation of the sleep/wake cycle. The data reviewed also suggest an important role of the astrocytic network. In addition, the role of astrocytes in NMC mechanisms is consistent with the “local and use dependent” sleep hypothesis.

A few decades ago it was discovered that two regions of the adult brain retain the ability to generate new neurons. These regions include the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the ventricular–subventricular zone (V–SVZ) located at the border of the lateral ventricle. In the V–SVZ, it was discovered that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) share many features of mature astrocytes and are often referred as V–SVZ astrocytes. We will first describe the markers, the morphology, and the neurophysiological characteristics of the mouse V–SVZ astrocytes. We will then discuss the fact that V–SVZ astrocytes constitute a mixed population with respect to their neurogenic properties, e.g., quiescent versus activated state, neurogenic fate, and transcription factors expression. Finally, we will describe two functions of V–SVZ astrocytes, their metabolic coupling to blood vessels and their neurogenic-supportive role consisting of providing guidance and survival cues to migrating newborn neurons.

AB  - Abstract
It has been proposed that a neural signature of aware pain perception could be represented by the modulation of gamma-band oscillation (GBO) power induced by nociceptive repetitive laser stimulation (RLS). The aim of our study was to correlate the RLS-induced GBO modulation with the Nociception Coma Scale-Revised (NCS-R) scores (a validated scale assessing possible aware pain perception in patients with chronic disorders of consciousness), in an attempt to differentiate unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) patients from minimally conscious state (MCS) ones (both of them are awake but exhibit no or limited and fluctuant behavioral signs of awareness and mentation, and low and high NCS-R scores, respectively). In addition, we attempted to identify those among UWS patients who probably experienced pain at covert level (i.e. being aware but unable to show pain-related purposeful behaviors, which are those sustained, reproducible, and voluntary behavioral responses to nociceptive stimuli). Notably, the possibility of clearly differentiating UWS from MCS patients has outmost consequences concerning prognosis (worse in UWS) and adequate pain treatment. RLS consisted in 80 trains of three laser stimuli (delivered at 1 Hz), at four different energies, able to evoke Aδ-fiber related laser evoked potentials. After each train, we assessed the NCS-R score. EEG was divided into epochs according to the laser trains, and the obtained epochs were classified in four categories according to the NCS-R score magnitude. We quantified the GBO absolute power for each category. RLS protocol induced a strongly correlated increase in GBO power and NCS-R score (the higher the laser stimulation intensity, the higher the NCS-R, independently of stimulus repetition) in all the MCS patients, thus confirming the presence of aware pain processing. Nonetheless, such findings were present even in five UWS individuals. This could suggest the presence of covert pain processing in such subjects, despite the low NCS-R scores. In conclusion, RSL-induced GBO power evaluation could be helpful in the differential diagnosis between MCS and UWS patients, besides the clinical assessment, and in identifying covert pain perception in some UWS individuals.

AB  - Abstract
Identification of neurons, and their phenotype, that are activated in response to specific stimuli is a critical step in understanding how neural networks integrate inputs to produce specific outputs. Here, we developed novel mouse monoclonal antibodies of different IgG isotypes that are specific to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and to tyrosine hydroxylase activated at its serine 40 position (pSer40TH), in order to assess changes in the activity of phenotypically identified cardiovascular neurons using fluorescence immunohistochemistry. We find that the proportion of C1 pSer40TH-positive neurons in the central and medial region of the rat rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) increases dramatically following hydralazine treatment, whereas phenylephrine treatment does not significantly change the pSer40TH/TH ratio in these regions compared to control. This finding suggests that there is a mediolateral topology associated with the activation of C1 neurons following baroreceptor loading or unloading. Overall, we conclude first, that our newly characterized monoclonal antibodies are specific, and selective, against TH and pSer40TH. Secondly, that they can be used to label TH and pSer40TH immunoreactive neurons simultaneously, and thirdly that that they can be used to identify the activation state of catecholamine synthetizing neurons after physiological stimuli. Finally, we find that there is basal level of activation of TH neurons in the lateral, central and medial regions (∼70%, 30% and 45%, respectively) of the C1 area, but that following unloading of the baroreceptors there is a marked increase in activation of central (∼80%) and medial (∼90%) C1 neurons in the RVLM.

AB  - Abstract
This study addressed the hypothesis that dorsomedial hindbrain adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) imposes inherent estradiol-dependent control of hypothalamic AMPK, neuropeptide, and norepinephrine (NE) activity and feeding in the female rat. Estradiol (E)- or oil (O)-implanted ovariectomized rats were injected with the AMPK inhibitor compound c (Cc) or vehicle into the caudal fourth ventricle (CV4) prior to micropunch-dissection of individual hypothalamic metabolic loci or assessment of food intake. Cc decreased hindbrain dorsal vagal complex phosphoAMPK (pAMPK) in both E and O; tissue ATP levels were reduced by this treatment in O only. In E/Cc, pAMPK expression was diminished in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) and ventromedial (VMH) and paraventricular (PVH) nuclei; only PVH pAMPK was suppressed by this treatment in O/Cc. Cc decreased PVH corticotropin-releasing hormone and arcuate (ARH) proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and neuropeptide Y in O, but suppressed only POMC in E. O/Cc exhibited both augmented (PVH, VMH) and decreased (LHA, ARH) hypothalamic NE content, whereas Cc treatment of E elevated preoptic and dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus NE. Cc completely or incompletely repressed feeding in E versus O, respectively. Results implicate dorsomedial hindbrain AMPK in physiological stimulus-induced feeding in females. Excepting POMC, hypothalamic neuropeptide responses to this sensor may be contingent on estrogen. Estradiol likely designates hypothalamic targets of altered NE signaling due to hindbrain AMPK activation. Divergent changes in NE content of hypothalamic loci in O/Cc uniquely demonstrate sensor-induced bimodal catecholamine signaling to those sites.

AB  - Abstract
Gray matter protoplasmic astrocytes, a major type of glial cell in the mammalian brain, extend thin processes ensheathing neuronal synaptic terminals. Albeit electrically silent, astrocytes respond to neuronal activity with Ca2+ signals that trigger the release of gliotransmitters, such as glutamate, d-serine, and ATP, which modulate synaptic transmission. It has been suggested that the astrocytic processes, together with neuronal pre- and post-synaptic elements, constitute a tripartite synapse, and that astrocytes actively regulate information processing. Astrocytic vesicles expressing VAMP2 and VAMP3 vesicular SNARE (vSNARE) proteins have been suggested to be a key feature of the tripartite synapse and mediate gliotransmitter release through Ca2+-regulated exocytosis. However, the concept of exocytotic release of gliotransmitters by astrocytes has been challenged. Here we review studies investigating the expression profile of VAMP2 and VAMP3 vSNARE proteins in rodent astrocytes, and the functional implication of VAMP2/VAMP3 vesicles in astrocyte signaling. We also discuss our recent data suggesting that astrocytic VAMP3 vesicles regulate the trafficking of glutamate transporters at the plasma membrane and glutamate uptake. A better understanding of the functional consequences of the astrocytic vSNARE vesicles on glutamate signaling, neuronal excitability and plasticity, will require the development of new strategies to selectively interrogate the astrocytic vesicles trafficking in vivo.

AB  - Abstract
During the normal aging process, the brain undergoes a range of biochemical and structural alterations, which may contribute to deterioration of sensory and cognitive functions. Age-related deficits are associated with altered efficacy of synaptic neurotransmission. Emerging evidence indicates that levels of agmatine, a putative neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain, are altered in a region-specific manner during the aging process. The gross tissue content of agmatine in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of aged rat brains is decreased whereas levels in the temporal cortex (TE) are increased. However, it is not known whether these changes in gross tissue levels are also mirrored by changes in agmatine levels at synapses and thus could potentially contribute to altered synaptic function with age. In the present study, agmatine levels in presynaptic terminals in the PFC and TE regions (300 terminals/region) of young (3 month; n = 3) and aged (24 month; n = 3) brains of male Sprague–Dawley rats were compared using quantitative post-embedding immunogold electron-microscopy. Presynaptic levels of agmatine were significantly increased in the TE region (60%; p &lt; 0.001) of aged rats compared to young rats, however no significant differences were detected in synaptic levels in the PFC region. Double immunogold labeling indicated that agmatine and glutamate were co-localized in the same synaptic terminals, and quantitative analyses revealed significantly reduced glutamate levels in agmatine-immunopositive synaptic terminals in both regions in aged rats compared to young animals. This study, for the first time, demonstrates differential effects of aging on agmatine and glutamate in the presynaptic terminals of PFC and TE. Future research is required to understand the functional significance of these changes and the underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract
This study examined whether peripheral inflammatory injury increases the levels or changes the disposition of substance P (SubP) in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), which serves as a central relay in bulbospinal pathways of pain modulation. Enzyme immunoassay and reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to measure SubP protein and transcript, respectively, in tissue homogenates prepared from the RVM and the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and cuneiform nuclei of rats that had received an intraplantar injection of saline or complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA). Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight analysis confirmed that the RVM does not contain hemokinin-1 (HK-1), which can confound measurements of SubP because it is recognized equally well by commercial antibodies for SubP. Levels of SubP protein in the RVM were unchanged four hours, four days and two weeks after injection of CFA. Tac1 transcripts were similarly unchanged in the RVM four days or two weeks after CFA. In contrast, the density of SubP immunoreactive processes in the RVM increased 2-fold within four hours and 2.7-fold four days after CFA injection; it was unchanged at two weeks. SubP-immunoreactive processes in the RVM include axon terminals of neurons located in the PAG and cuneiform nucleus. SubP content in homogenates of the PAG and cuneiform nucleus was significantly increased four days after CFA, but not at four hours or two weeks. Tac1 transcripts in homogenates of these nuclei were unchanged four days and two weeks after CFA. These findings suggest that there is an increased mobilization of SubP within processes in the RVM shortly after injury accompanied by an increased synthesis of SubP in neurons that project to the RVM. These findings are consonant with the hypothesis that an increase in SubP release in the RVM contributes to the hyperalgesia that develops after peripheral inflammatory injury.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic treatment with the monoamine releaser d-amphetamine has been consistently shown to decrease cocaine self-administration in laboratory studies and clinical trials. However, the abuse potential of d-amphetamine is an obstacle to widespread clinical use. Approaches are needed that exploit the efficacy of the agonist approach but avoid the abuse potential associated with dopamine releasers. The present study assessed the effectiveness of chronic oral administration of phendimetrazine (PDM), a pro-drug for the monoamine releaser phenmetrazine (PM), to decrease cocaine self-administration in four rhesus monkeys. Each day, monkeys pressed a lever to receive food pellets under a 50-response fixed-ratio (FR) schedule of reinforcement and self-administered cocaine (0.003–0.56 mg/kg per injection, i.v.) under a progressive-ratio (PR) schedule in the evening. After completing a cocaine self-administration dose–response curve, sessions were suspended and PDM was administered (1.0–9.0 mg/kg, p.o., b.i.d.). Cocaine self-administration was assessed using the PR schedule once every 7 days while food-maintained responding was studied daily. When a persistent decrease in self-administration was observed, the cocaine dose–effect curve was re-determined. Daily PDM treatment decreased cocaine self-administration by 30–90% across monkeys for at least 4 weeks. In two monkeys, effects were completely selective for cocaine. Tolerance developed to initial decreases in food-maintained responding in the third monkey and in the fourth subject, fluctuations were observed that were lower in magnitude than effects on cocaine self-administration. Cocaine dose–effect curves were shifted down and/or rightward in three monkeys. These data provide further support for the use of agonist medications for cocaine abuse, and indicate that the promising effects of d-amphetamine extend to a more clinically viable pharmacotherapy.

AB  - Abstract
Exposure to ethanol during fetal development produces long-lasting neurobehavioral deficits caused by functional alterations in neuronal circuits across multiple brain regions. Therapeutic interventions currently used to treat these deficits are only partially efficacious, which is a consequence of limited understanding of the mechanism of action of ethanol. Here, we describe a novel effect of ethanol in the developing brain. Specifically, we show that exposure of rats to ethanol in vapor chambers during the equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy causes brain micro-hemorrhages. This effect was observed both at low and high doses of ethanol vapor exposure, and was not specific to this exposure paradigm as it was also observed when ethanol was administered via intra-esophageal gavage. The vast majority of the micro-hemorrhages were located in the cerebral cortex but were also observed in the hypothalamus, midbrain, olfactory tubercle, and striatum. The auditory, cingulate, insular, motor, orbital, retrosplenial, somatosensory, and visual cortices were primarily affected. Immunohistochemical experiments showed that the micro-hemorrhages caused neuronal loss, as well as reactive astrogliosis and microglial activation. Analysis with the Catwalk test revealed subtle deficits in motor function during adolescence/young adulthood. In conclusion, our study provides additional evidence linking developmental ethanol exposure with alterations in the fetal cerebral vasculature. Given that this effect was observed at moderate levels of ethanol exposure, our findings lend additional support to the recommendation that women abstain from consuming alcoholic beverages during pregnancy.

AB  - Abstract
The most promising therapeutic approach to finding the cure for devastating demyelinating conditions is the identification of clinically safe pharmacological agents that can promote differentiation of endogenous oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Here we show that the breast cancer medication tamoxifen (TMX), with well-documented clinical safety and confirmed beneficial effects in various models of demyelinating conditions, stimulates differentiation of rat glial progenitors to mature oligodendrocytes in vitro. Clinically applicable doses of TMX significantly increased both the number of CNPase-positive oligodendrocytes and protein levels of myelin basic protein, measured with Western blots. Furthermore, we also found that OPC differentiation was stimulated, not only by the pro-drug TMX-citrate (TMXC), but also by two main TMX metabolites, 4-hydroxy-TMX and endoxifen. Differentiating effects of TMXC and its metabolites were completely abolished in the presence of estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist, ICI182780. In contrast to TMXC and 4-hydroxy-TMX, endoxifen also induced astrogliogenesis, but independent of the ER activation. In sum, we showed that the TMX prodrug and its two main metabolites (4-hydroxy-TMX and endoxifen) promote ER-dependent oligodendrogenesis in vitro, not reported before. Given that differentiating effects of TMX were achieved with clinically safe doses, TMX is likely one of the most promising FDA-approved drugs for the possible treatment of demyelinating diseases.

AB  - Abstract
Central blockade of mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) or angiotensin II type 1 receptors (AT1Rs) attenuates aldosterone (aldo)-salt induced hypertension. We examined the role of the subfornical organ (SFO), aldo synthesized locally in the brain, and MR and AT1R specifically in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in aldo-salt hypertension. Wistar rats were treated with subcutaneous aldo (1 μg/h) plus saline as drinking fluid, and gene expression was assessed by real-time qPCR. Other sets of rats received chronic intra-cerebroventricular (icv) infusion of aldo synthase (AS) inhibitor FAD286, MR blocker eplerenone or vehicle, electrolytic or sham lesions of the SFO, or intra-PVN infusion of AAV-MR-siRNA or AAV-AT1aR-siRNA. Infusion of aldo had no effect on 11βHSD2, MR and AT1R mRNA in different nuclei but increased CYP11B2 mRNA in the SFO, and serum and glucocorticoid-kinase 1 (Sgk1) and epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) γ subunit mRNA in the SFO and supraoptic nucleus (SON). MR-siRNA decreased both MR and AT1R mRNA in the PVN by ∼60%, but AT1aR-siRNA only decreased AT1R mRNA. SFO lesion, blockade of brain AS or MR, or knockdown of MR or AT1R in the PVN similarly attenuated aldosterone-induced saline intake by ∼50% and hypertension by ∼70%. These results suggest that an increase in circulating aldosterone may via MR and AT1R in the SFO increase local aldosterone production in hypothalamic nuclei such as the SON and PVN, and via MR enhance AT1R signaling in the PVN. This central aldosterone-MR-AT1R neuro-modulatory pathway appears to play a major role in the progressive hypertension.

AB  - Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) inhibit RNA targets and may contribute to postpartum central nervous system (CNS) gene expression changes, although this has never been tested. In the present study, we directly evaluated miRNA levels using RNA sequencing during reproduction in female mice in the lateral septum (LS). We found the reliable and robust changes of miRNAs away from the virgin stage at the three other stages, namely pregnant, day 1 postpartum, and day 8 postpartum. For a given miRNA that was significantly different from the virgin condition in more than one group, the direction of change was always the same. Overall, we identified 32 upregulated miRNAs and 25 downregulated miRNAs that were consistently different from the virgin state. ‘Arm switching’ occurs for miR-433-3 and miR-7b. Unexpectedly, a third of upregulated miRNAs (relative to virgin) were highly localized within the 12qF1 region of chromosome 12 that includes the Dlk1-Dio3 gene cluster implicated in stem cell and neuronal differentiation. Over 1500 genes were targeted by multiple upregulated miRNAs with about 100 genes targeted by five or more miRNAs. Over 1000 genes were targeted by multiple downregulated miRNAs with about 50 genes targeted by five or more miRNAs. Half of the target genes were regulated by up and downregulated miRNAs, indicating homeostatic regulation. Transcriptional regulation was the most enriched pathway for genes linked to up or down regulated miRNAs. Other enriched pathways included protein kinase activity (e.g., MAP kinase), CNS development, axon guidance, neurotrophin signaling, neuron development/differentiation, and neurogenesis. Previously published postpartum LS gene expression changes were enrichment for LS miRNA targets, as expected. Surprisingly, postpartum gene expression changes from other regions were also enriched against LS miRNA targets, suggesting a core group of miRNAs may act across the CNS during reproduction. Together, we directly examine miRNAs and find significant alterations in the postpartum brain.

AB  - Abstract
Peroxisomes constitute special cellular organelles which display a variety of metabolic functions including fatty acid oxidation and free radical elimination. Abundance of these flexible organelles varies in response to different environmental stimuli. It has been demonstrated that PEX11β, a peroxisomal membrane elongation factor, is involved in the regulation of size, shape and number of peroxisomes. To investigate the role of PEX11β in neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), we generated a stably transduced mESCs line that derives the expression of a short hairpin RNA against Pex11β gene following doxycycline (Dox) induction. Knock-down of Pex11β, during neural differentiation, significantly reduced the expression of neural progenitor cells and mature neuronal markers (p &lt; 0.05) indicating that decreased expression of PEX11β suppresses neuronal maturation. Additionally, mRNA levels of other peroxisome-related genes such as PMP70, Pex11α, Catalase, Pex19 and Pex5 were also significantly reduced by Pex11β knock-down (p &lt; 0.05). Interestingly, pretreatment of transduced mESCs with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ agonist (pioglitazone (Pio)) ameliorated the inhibitory effects of Pex11β knock down on neural differentiation. Pio also significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased the expression of neural progenitor and mature neuronal markers besides the expression of peroxisomal genes in transduced mESC. Results elucidated the importance of Pex11β expression in neural differentiation of mESCs, thereby highlighting the essential role of peroxisomes in mammalian neural differentiation. The observation that Pio recovered peroxisomal function and improved neural differentiation of Pex11β knocked-down mESCs, proposes a potential new pharmacological implication of Pio for neurogenesis in patients with peroxisomal defects.

AB  - Abstract
Delivering effective commands in the nervous systems require a temporal integration of neural activities such as synchronous firing. Although sympathetic nerve discharges are characterized by synchronous firing, its temporal structures and how it is modulated are largely unknown. This study used a collagenase-dissociated splanchnic sympathetic nerve–thoracic spinal cord preparation of neonatal rats in vitro as an experimental model. Several single-fiber activities were recorded simultaneously and verified by rigorous computational algorithms. Among 3763 fiber pairs that had spontaneous fiber activities, 382 fiber pairs had firing positively correlated. Their temporal relationship was quantitatively evaluated by cross-correlogram. On average, correlated firing in a fiber pair occurred in scales of ∼40 ms lasting for ∼11 ms. The relative frequency distribution curves of correlogram parametrical values pertinent to the temporal features were best described by trimodal Gaussians, suggesting a correlated firing originated from three or less sources. Applications of bicuculline or gabazine (noncompetitive or competitive GABAA receptor antagonist) and/or strychnine (noncompetitive glycine receptor antagonist) increased, decreased, or did not change individual fiber activities. Antagonist-induced enhancement and attenuation of correlated firing were demonstrated by a respective increase and decrease of the peak probability of the cross-correlograms. Heterogeneity in antagonistic responses suggests that the inhibitory neurotransmission mediated by GABAA and glycine receptors is not essential for but can serve as a neural substrate to modulate synchronous firing behaviors. Plausible neural mechanisms were proposed to explain the temporal structures of correlated firing between sympathetic fibers.

In order to decipher the disease etiology, progression and treatment of multifactorial human brain diseases we utilize a host of different experimental models. Recently, patient-derived human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cultures have re-emerged as promising in vitro functional system for examining various cellular, molecular, metabolic and (patho)physiological states and traits of psychiatric disorders. HDF studies serve as a powerful complement to postmortem and animal studies, and often appear to be informative about the altered homeostasis in neural tissue. Studies of HDFs from patients with schizophrenia (SZ), depression, bipolar disorder (BD), autism, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and other psychiatric disorders have significantly advanced our understanding of these devastating diseases. These reports unequivocally prove that signal transduction, redox homeostasis, circadian rhythms and gene*environment (G*E) interactions are all amenable for assessment by the HDF model. Furthermore, the reported findings suggest that this underutilized patient biomaterial, combined with modern molecular biology techniques, may have both diagnostic and prognostic value, including prediction of response to therapeutic agents.

AB  - Abstract
The time course of the induction of enzymes responsible for the formation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) after an inflammatory insult, in relation to the concomitant febrile response, suggests that peripherally generated PGE2 is involved in the induction of the early phase of fever, while centrally produced PGE2 exerts pyrogenic capacities during the later stages of fever within the hypothalamic median preoptic nucleus (MnPO). The actions of peripherally derived PGE2 on the brain might occur at the level of the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis (OVLT), which lacks a tight blood–brain barrier and is implicated in fever, while the effects of PGE2 within the MnPO might interfere with glutamatergic neurotransmission within a recently characterized central efferent pathway for the activation of cold-defence reactions. Using the fura-2 ratio imaging technique we, therefore, measured changes of the intracellular Ca2+-concentration in primary neuroglial microcultures of rat OVLT and MnPO stimulated with PGE2 and/or glutamate. In cultures from the OVLT, as opposed to those derived from the MnPO, substantial numbers of neurons (8% of 385), astrocytes (19% of 645) and microglial cells (28% of 43) directly responded to PGE2 with a transient increase of intracellular Ca2+. The most pronounced effect of PGE2 on cells from MnPO microcultures was its modulatory influence on the strength of glutamate-induced Ca2+-signals. In 72 out of 512 neurons and in 105 out of 715 astrocytes PGE2 significantly augmented glutamate-induced Ca2+-signals. About 30% of these neurons were GABAergic. These observations are in agreement with putative roles of peripheral PGE2 as a directly acting circulating agent at the level of the OVLT, and of central MnPO-intrinsic PGE2 as an enhancer of glutamatergic neurotransmission, which causes disinhibition of thermogenic heat production, a crucial component for the manifestation of fever. In microcultures from both brain sites investigated incubation with PGE2 significantly reduced the lipopolysaccharide-induced release of cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6) into the supernatant. PGE2, thus, seems to be involved in a negative feed-back loop to limit the strength of the brain inflammatory process and to play a dual role with pro- as well as anti-inflammatory properties.

AB  - Abstract
Flexion/withdrawal reflexes are attenuated by spinal, intracerebroventricular (ICV) and systemic delivery of cholinergic agonists. In contrast, some affective reactions to pain are suppressed by systemic cholinergic antagonism. Attention to aversive stimulation can be impaired, as is classical conditioning of fear and anxiety to aversive stimuli and psychological activation of stress reactions that exacerbate pain. Thus, in contrast to the suppressive effects of cholinergic agonism on reflexes, pain sensitivity and affective reactions to pain could be attenuated by reduced cerebral cholinergic activation. This possibility was evaluated in the present study, using an operant test of escape from nociceptive thermal stimulation (10 °C and 44.5 °C) before and after destruction of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. ICV injection of 192 IgG-saporin produced widespread loss of basal forebrain cholinergic innervation of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Post-injection, escape from thermal stimulation was decreased with no indication of recovery for upto 19 weeks. Also, the normal hyperalgesic effect of sound stress was absent after ICV 192-sap. Effects of cerebral cholinergic denervation or stress on nociceptive licking and guarding reflexes were not consistent with the effects on operant escape, highlighting the importance of evaluating pain sensitivity of laboratory animals with an operant behavioral test. These results reveal that basal forebrain cholinergic transmission participates in the cerebral processing of pain, which may be relevant to the pain sensitivity of patients with Alzheimer’s disease who have prominent degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons.

Objective: Measures of short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) can be contaminated by excitatory influences of short-interval intracortical facilitation (SICF), unless examined at individually-optimized interstimulus intervals (ISIs). We hypothesized that age-related differences in SICF would explain previously reported reduced SICI in children and adolescents compared with adults. Methods: Fifty-one participants, aged 8–29 years, underwent transcranial magnetic stimulation. SICF curves were constructed to determine the ISI at which SICF was minimal (i.e. the first trough). SICI curves were constructed at this individually-determined ISI with conditioning stimulus (S1) intensities of 60–110% of active motor threshold. Results: There was no effect of age on the ISI corresponding with the SICF trough. However, there was a main effect of age on the amplitude of the conditioned motor-evoked potential at the different ISIs, such that children aged 8–12 years demonstrated greater SICF than those aged 16–18 and 19–21 years. There was no effect of age on SICI, and no interaction between age group and S1 intensity. Conclusions: Compared with that in older adolescents and young adults, SICF is enhanced in children aged 8–12 years. Surprisingly, this enhanced SICF does not appear to reduce the degree of SICI that can be evoked at the first trough in this age group. Significance: This is the first report of enhanced SICF in young children. It remains possible that enhanced SICF may have confounded earlier reports of reduced SICI in children less than 8 years.

AB  - Abstract
Aluminum is a light weight and toxic metal present ubiquitously on earth, which has gained considerable attention due to its neurotoxic effects. It also has been linked ecologically and epidemiologically to several neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Guamanian–Parkinsonian complex and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The mechanism of aluminum neurotoxicity is poorly understood, but it is well documented that aluminum generates reactive oxygen species (ROS). Enhanced ROS production leads to disruption of cellular antioxidant defense systems and release of cytochrome c (cyt-c) from mitochondria to cytosol resulting in apoptotic cell death. Quercetin (a natural flavonoid) protects it from oxidative damage and has been shown to decrease mitochondrial damage in various animal models of oxidative stress. We hypothesized that if oxidative damage to mitochondria does play a significant role in aluminum-induced neurodegeneration, and then quercetin should ameliorate neuronal apoptosis. Administration of quercetin (10 mg/kg body wt/day) reduced aluminum (10 mg/kg body wt/day)-induced oxidative stress (decreased ROS production, increased mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity). In addition, quercetin also prevents aluminum-induced translocation of cyt-c, and up-regulates Bcl-2, down-regulates Bax, p53, caspase-3 activation and reduces DNA fragmentation. Quercetin also obstructs aluminum-induced neurodegenerative changes in aluminum-treated rats as seen by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining. Further electron microscopic studies revealed that quercetin attenuates aluminum-induced mitochondrial swelling, loss of cristae and chromatin condensation. These results indicate that treatment with quercetin may represent a therapeutic strategy to attenuate the neuronal death against aluminum-induced neurodegeneration.

AB  - Abstract
Fifteen years ago the concept of the “tripartite synapse” was proposed to conceptualize the functional view that astrocytes are integral elements of synapses. The signaling exchange between astrocytes and neurons within the tripartite synapse results in the synaptic regulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity through an autocrine form of communication. However, recent evidence indicates that the astrocyte synaptic regulation is not restricted to the active tripartite synapse but can be manifested through astrocyte signaling at synapses relatively distant from active synapses, a process termed lateral astrocyte synaptic regulation. This phenomenon resembles the classical heterosynaptic modulation but is mechanistically different because it involves astrocytes and its properties critically depend on the morphological and functional features of astrocytes. Therefore, the functional concept of the tripartite synapse as a fundamental unit must be expanded to include the interaction between tripartite synapses. Through lateral synaptic regulation, astrocytes serve as an active processing bridge for synaptic interaction and crosstalk between synapses with no direct neuronal connectivity, supporting the idea that neural network function results from the coordinated activity of astrocytes and neurons.

AB  - Abstract
The endocannabinoid system is an important regulator of physiological functions. In the brain, this control is mainly exerted through the type-1-cannabinoid (CB1) receptors. CB1 receptors are abundant at neuron terminals where their stimulation inhibits neurotransmitter release. However, CB1 receptors are also expressed in astrocytes and recent studies showed that astroglial cannabinoid signaling is a key element of the tripartite synapse. In this review we discuss the different mechanisms by which astroglial CB1 receptors control synaptic transmission and plasticity. The recent involvement of astroglial CB1 receptors in the effects of cannabinoids on memory highlights their key roles in cognitive processes and further indicates that astrocytes are central active elements of high-order brain functions.

Synaptic plasticity is the capacity of a preexisting connection between two neurons to change in strength as a function of neural activity. Because synaptic plasticity is the major candidate mechanism for learning and memory, the elucidation of its constituting mechanisms is of crucial importance in many aspects of normal and pathological brain function. In particular, a prominent aspect that remains debated is how the plasticity mechanisms, that encompass a broad spectrum of temporal and spatial scales, come to play together in a concerted fashion. Here we review and discuss evidence that pinpoints to a possible non-neuronal, glial candidate for such orchestration: the regulation of synaptic plasticity by astrocytes.

AB  - Abstract
Introduction: Seizure control is one of the ultimate aims of epileptology: here acute and prolonged effects of closed loop high-frequency stimulation of the somatosensory cortex on the expression of spontaneously occurring spike-wave discharges (SWD) were investigated in a genetic absence model. Effects of closed loop stimulation in the experimental group were compared with a yoked control group allowing to investigate the effect of timing related to SWD occurrence, while controlling for amount and intensity of stimulation.

Methods: WAG/Rij rats were implanted with stimulation electrodes in the deep layers of the somatosensory cortex, and recording electrodes in the cortex and thalamus. Closed-loop and yoked stimulation (1 sec trains, biphasic 0.4 msec pulses, 130 Hz) sessions lasted 24 h. The stimulation sessions were preceded and followed by baseline and post stimulation 24-h recordings.

Results: Closed-loop stimulation interrupted SWD and duration of SWD was shortened. Both types of stimulation resulted in a reduction in SWD number during stimulation sessions. Closed-loop stimulation also resulted in less SWD during the last eight hours of the post-stimulation recording session. Sometimes yoked stimulation induced low-frequency afterdischarges.

Discussion: SWD can be aborted by closed-loop stimulation of the somatosensory cortex, and at the same time the number of SWD was reduced. It can be regarded as a relatively safe neuromodulatory technique without habituation. The reduction of SWD during yoked stimulation session might be caused by 3 Hz afterdischarges. The reduction of SWD on the stimulation and post-stimulation sessions demonstrates the critical relevance of timing for the induction of longer lasting neuromodulatory effects: it suggests that absence seizures themselves might be involved in their reoccurrence.

AB  - Abstract
Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by abnormal reciprocal social interactions, communication deficits, and repetitive behaviors with restricted interests. However, the widely accepted biomarkers for autism are still lacking. In this study, we carried out a quantitative proteomic profiling study of cortical brain tissue from BTBR T+ Itpr3tf (BTBR) mice, a mouse model that displays an autism-like phenotype. Using isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) coupled with LC–MS/MS, a total of 3611 proteins were quantitated in mouse cortices. As compared to C57BL/6J (B6) mice, 126 differentially expressed proteins were found in the brain from BTBR mice. The functional annotation and categories of differentially expressed proteins were analyzed. Especially, the stable tubule only polypeptide (STOP) protein and myelin-related proteins down-regulated significantly in BTBR mice were confirmed by Western blotting. Furthermore, the BTBR mice displayed reduced levels of staining with ferric alum in comparison to B6 controls, indicative of myelin disruption. Finally, we propose that reduced STOP expression in the brain could be involved in the mediation of autism-like behaviors through impairments of myelination in oligodendrocytes and synaptic function in neurons. Manipulation of STOP protein could be a promising avenue for therapeutic interventions to autism.

AB  - Abstract
Although thrombin has an important role in both central and peripheral nerve diseases, characterization of the anatomical distribution of its proteolytic activity has been limited by available methods. This study presents the development, challenges, validation and implementation of a novel histochemical method for visualization of thrombin activity in the nervous system. The method is based on the cleavage of the substrate, Boc-Asp(OBzl)-Pro-Arg-4MβNA by thrombin to liberate free 4-methoxy-2-naphthylamine (4MβNA). In the presence of 5-nitrosalicylaldehyde, free 4MβNA is captured, yielding an insoluble yellow fluorescent precipitate which marks the site of thrombin activity. The sensitivity of the method was determined in vitro using known concentrations of thrombin while the specificity was verified using a highly specific thrombin inhibitor. Using this method we determined the spatial distribution of thrombin activity in mouse brain following transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAo) and in mouse sciatic nerve following crush injury. Fluorescence microscopy revealed well-defined thrombin activity localized to the right ischemic hemisphere in cortical areas and in the striatum compared to negligible thrombin activity contralaterally. The histochemical localization of thrombin activity following tMCAo was in good correlation with the infarct areas per triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and to thrombin activity measured biochemically in tissue punches (85 ± 35 and 20 ± 3 mU/ml, in the cortical and striatum areas respectively, compared to 7 ± 2 and 13 ± 2 mU/ml, in the corresponding contralateral areas; mean ± SEM; p &lt; 0.05). In addition, 24 h following crush injury, focal areas of highly elevated thrombin activity were detected in teased sciatic fibers. This observation was supported by the biochemical assay and western blot technique. The histochemical method developed in this study can serve as an important tool for studying the role of thrombin in physiological and pathological conditions.

AB  - Abstract
In homeotherms, the hypothalamus controls thermoregulatory and adaptive mechanisms in energy balance, sleep–wake and locomotor activity to maintain optimal body temperature. Orexin neurons may be involved in these functions as they promote thermogenesis, food intake and behavioral arousal, and are sensitive to temperature and metabolic status. How thermal and energy balance signals are integrated in these neurons is unknown. Thus, we investigated the cellular mechanisms of thermosensing in orexin neurons and their response to a change in energy status using whole-cell patch clamp on rat brain slices. We found that warming induced an increase in miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) frequency, which was blocked by the transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) receptor antagonist AMG9810 and mimicked by its agonist capsaicin, suggesting that the synaptic effect is mediated by heat-sensitive TRPV1 channels. Furthermore, warming inhibits orexin neurons by activating ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, an effect regulated by uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), as the UCP2 inhibitor genipin abolished this response. These properties are unique to orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, as neighboring melanin-concentrating hormone neurons showed no response to warming within the physiological temperature range. Interestingly, in rats fed with western diet for 1 or 11 weeks, orexin neurons had impaired synaptic and KATP response to warming. In summary, this study reveals several mechanisms underlying thermosensing in orexin neurons and their attenuation by western diet. Overeating induced by western diet may in part be due to impaired orexin thermosensing, as post-prandial thermogenesis may promote satiety and lethargy by inhibiting orexin neurons.

AB  - Abstract
Sox2 (SRY (Sex-determining region Y)-related high mobility group (HMG) box 2) is a transcription factor that serves key roles in controlling the balance between stem cells maintenance and commitment to differentiated lineages throughout the lifetime. Importantly, Sox2 deficiency results in early embryonic lethality whereas the down-regulation of Sox2 expression triggers neurodegeneration in the adult mouse brain. Moreover, Sox2 is decreased in the brain of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients and co localizes with the β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) in stem cells. Here we report the existence of functional interactions between Sox2 and βAPP, the βAPP intracellular domain AICD50 and the α-secretase ADAM10 in human cells. We first show, as observed in embryonic stem cells, that βAPP overexpression in HEK293 cells results in an increase of Sox2 immunoreactivity and we further establish the transcriptional nature of this pathway. Moreover, overexpression of the pro-apoptotic C-terminal βAPP-derived AICD50 metabolite leads to the down-regulation of Sox2 transcription whereas the pharmacological inhibition of endogenous AICD production increases Sox2 expression in both HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cell lines. In addition, we demonstrate that Sox2 is a potent activator of the non amyloidogenic processing of βAPP as shown by the Sox2-dependent augmentation of ADAM10 catalytic activity, immunoreactivity, promoter transactivation and mRNA levels with no modification of the activity and the expression of the β-secretase BACE1. Finally, the fact that γ-secretase inhibition induces an increase of ADAM10 protein levels in SH-SY5Y cells further supports the occurrence of functional AICD/Sox2/ADAM10 interactions. Altogether, our study identifies and characterizes new functional cross-talks between Sox2 and proteins involved in AD, thereby adding support to the view that Sox2 likely behaves as a protective factor during the development of this neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - Abstract
Post-traumatic syringomyelia (PTS) is a serious neurological disorder characterized by fluid filled cavities that develop in the spinal cord. PTS is thought to be caused by an imbalance between fluid inflow and outflow in the spinal cord, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. The ion channel Kir4.1 plays an important role in the uptake of K+ ions from the extracellular space and release of K+ ions into the microvasculature, generating an osmotic gradient that drives water movement. Changes in Kir4.1 expression may contribute to disturbances in K+ homeostasis and subsequently fluid imbalance. Here we investigated whether changes in Kir4.1 protein expression occur in PTS. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate Kir4.1 and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression in a rodent model of PTS at 3 days, 1, 6 or 12 weeks post-surgery. In Western blotting experiments, Kir4.1 expression increased 1 week post-surgery at the level of the cavity. Immunohistochemical analysis examined changes in the spinal parenchyma directly in contact with the syrinx cavity. In these experiments, there was a significant decrease in Kir4.1 expression in PTS animals compared to controls at 3 days and 6 weeks post-surgery, while an up-regulation of GFAP in PTS animals was observed at 1 and 12 weeks. This suggests that while overall Kir4.1 expression is unchanged at these time-points, there are many astrocytes surrounding the syrinx cavity that are not expressing Kir4.1. The results demonstrate a disturbance in the removal of K+ ions in tissue surrounding a post-traumatic syrinx cavity. It is possible this contributes to water accumulation in the injured spinal cord leading to syrinx formation or exacerbation of the underlying pathology.

AB  - Abstract
Background: During the last decades, the use of light-emitting diode therapy (LEDT) has increased significantly for the treatment of wound healing, analgesia and inflammatory processes. Nevertheless, scientific data on the mechanisms responsible for the therapeutic effect of LEDT are still insufficient. Thus, this study investigated the analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effect of LEDT in the model of chronic inflammatory hyperalgesia. Experimental procedures: Mice injected with Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA) underwent behavioral, i.e. mechanical and hot hyperalgesia; determination of cytokine levels (tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-10), oxidative stress markers (protein carbonyls and thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS)) and antioxidant enzymes (catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD)). Additionally, mice were pretreated with either naloxone or fucoidin and mechanical hyperalgesia was assessed. Results: LEDT inhibited mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia induced by CFA injection. LEDT did not reduce paw edema, neither influenced the levels of TNF-α and IL1-β; although it increased the levels of IL-10. LEDT significantly prevented TBARS increase in both acute and chronic phases post-CFA injection; whereas protein carbonyl levels were reduced only in the acute phase. LEDT induced an increase in both SOD and CAT activity, with effects observable in the acute but not in the chronic. And finally, pre-administration of naloxone or fucoidin prevented LEDT analgesic effect. Conclusions: These data contribute to the understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms involved in the therapeutic effect of LEDT as well as provides additional support for its use in the treatment of painful conditions of inflammatory etiology.

AB  - Abstract
Acetylcholinesterase plays a major role in neuromuscular transmission and is regulated by neuromuscular activity. Since fast-twitch motor units are recruited with increased motor demand, we examined acetylcholinesterase regulation in rat leg muscles following treadmill training. Total acetylcholinesterase and specifically the membrane-bound tetramer increased in exercised fast-, but not slow-twitch muscles, while other isoforms remained unchanged. Synaptic acetylcholinesterase increased markedly in neuromuscular junctions of trained fibers, without concomitant changes in synaptic acetylcholine receptor, thus elevating synaptic acetylcholinesterase/receptor ratios. Electron microscopy showed that acetylcholinesterase increased in postjunctional folds and primary cleft, where it was added adjacent to the postsynaptic muscle membrane. Thus, although the primary acetylcholinesterase at the neuromuscular junction is the collagen-tailed asymmetric isoform associated with synaptic basal lamina, physiological demands such as strenuous exercise, or potentially pathological conditions, can selectively recruit the membrane-bound acetylcholinesterase tetramer to the synapse for optimal synaptic transmission.

AB  - Abstract
Retinal bipolar cells are second-order neurons in the visual system, which initiate multiple image feature-based neural streams. Among more than ten types of bipolar cells, type-5 cells are thought to play a role in motion detection pathways. Multiple subsets of type-5 cells have been reported; however, detailed characteristics of each subset have not yet been elucidated. Here, we found that they exhibit distinct morphological features as well as unique voltage-gated channel expression. We have conducted electrophysiological and immunohistochemical analysis of retinal bipolar cells. We defined type-5 cells by their axon terminal ramification in the inner plexiform layer between the border of ON/OFF sublaminae and the ON choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) band. We found three subsets of type-5 cells: XBCs had the widest axon terminals that stratified at a close approximation of the ON ChAT band as well as exhibiting large voltage-gated Na+ channel activity, type-5-1 cells had compact terminals and no Na+ channel activity, and type-5-2 cells contained umbrella-shaped terminals as well as large voltage-gated Na+ channel activity. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) currents were also evoked in all type-5 bipolar cells. We found that XBCs and type-5-2 cells exhibited larger HCN currents than type-5-1 cells. Furthermore, the former two types showed stronger HCN1 expression than the latter. Our previous observations (Ichinose et al., 2014) match the current study: low temporal tuning cells that we named 5S corresponded to 5-1 in this study, while high temporal tuning 5f cells from the previous study corresponded to 5-2 cells. Taken together, we found three subsets of type-5 bipolar cells based on their morphologies and physiological features.

AB  - Abstract
Background and objectives: Dual-task (DT) gait impairment in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and specifically in those with freezing of gait (FOG), reflects attentional dependency of movement. This study aimed to elucidate resting-state brain connectivity alterations related to DT gait abnormalities in PD with and without FOG. Methods: PD patients (n = 73) and healthy age-matched controls (n = 20) underwent DT gait analysis and resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-MRI) while ‘off’ medication. Patients were classified as freezer (n = 13) or non-freezer (n = 60). Functional connectivity (FC) alterations between PD and controls and between patient subgroups were assessed in regions of interest (ROIs) within the fronto-parietal and motor network. Results: PD had longer stance times, shorter swing times and more step length asymmetry during DT gait and needed more time and steps during DT turning compared to controls. Additionally, freezers showed similar impairments and longer double support times compared to non-freezers during DT gait. PD demonstrated hyper-connectivity between the inferior parietal lobule and premotor cortex (PMC) and between the cerebellum and the PMC and M1. FOG-specific hypo-connectivity within the striatum and between the caudate and superior temporal lobe and hyper-connectivity between the dorsal putamen and precuneus was correlated with worse DT performance. Conclusion: PD showed FC alterations in DT-related networks, which were not correlated to DT performance. However, FOG-specific FC alterations in DT-related regions involving the precuneus and striatum were correlated to worse DT performance, suggesting that the balance between cognitive and motor networks is altered.

Astrocytes are major non-neuronal cell types in the central nervous system that regulate a variety of processes in the brain including synaptic transmission, neurometabolism, and cerebrovasculature tone. Recent discoveries have revealed that astrocytes perform very specialized and heterogeneous roles in brain homeostasis and function. Exactly how astrocytes fulfill such diverse roles in the brain remains to be fully understood and is an active area of research. In this review, we focus on the complex subcellular anatomical features of protoplasmic gray matter astrocytes in the mature, healthy brain that likely empower these cells with the ability to detect and respond to changes in neuronal and synaptic activity. In particular, we discuss how intricate processes on astrocytes allow these cells to communicate with neurons and their synapses and strategically deliver specific cellular organelles such as mitochondria and ribosomes to active compartments within the neuropil. Understanding the properties of these structural elements will lead to a better understanding of how astrocytes function in the healthy and diseased brain.

AB  - Abstract
Minocycline, a second-generation tetracycline, is well known for its antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, and antinociceptive effects. Modulation of synaptic transmission is one of the analgesic mechanisms of minocycline. Although it has been reported that minocycline may suppress excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission, it remains unclear whether it could affect inhibitory synaptic transmission, which also plays a key role in modulating pain signaling.

To examine the effect of minocycline on synaptic transmission in rat spinal substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurons, we recorded spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) using whole-cell patch-clamp recording at a holding potential of 0 mV. Bath application of minocycline significantly increased the frequency but not the amplitude of sIPSCs in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 of 85.

The enhancement of inhibitory synaptic transmission produced by minocycline was not affected by the glutamate receptor antagonists CNQX and D-APV or by the voltage-gated sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX). Moreover, the potency of minocycline for facilitating sIPSC frequency was the same in both glycinergic and GABAergic sIPSCs without changing their decay phases. However, the facilitatory effect of minocycline on sIPSCs was eliminated in a Ca2+-free Krebs solution or by co-administration with calcium channel blockers.

In summary, our data demonstrate that baseline inhibitory synaptic transmission in SG neurons is markedly enhanced by minocycline. This may function to decrease the excitability of SG neurons, thus leading to a modulation of nociceptive transmission.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic exposure to low-dose 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) in marmoset monkeys was used to model the prodromal stage of Parkinson’s disease (PD), and to investigate mechanisms underlying disease progression and recovery. Marmosets were subcutaneously injected with MPTP for a period of 12 weeks, 0.5 mg/kg once per week, and clinical signs of Parkinsonism, motor- and non-motor behaviors were recorded before, during and after exposure. In addition, postmortem immunohistochemistry and proteomics analysis were performed. MPTP-induced parkinsonian clinical symptoms increased in severity during exposure, and recovered after MPTP administration was ended. Postmortem analyses, after the recovery period, revealed no alteration of the number and sizes of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra. Also levels of TH in putamen and caudate nucleus were unaltered, no differences were observed in DA, serotonin or nor-adrenalin levels in the caudate nucleus, and proteomics analysis revealed no global changes in protein expression in these brain areas between treatment groups. Our findings indicate that parkinsonian symptoms can occur without detectable damage at the cellular or molecular level. Moreover, we show that parkinsonian symptoms may be reversible when diagnosed and treated early.

AB  - Abstract
Syrian hamsters exposed to anabolic/androgenic steroids (AAS) during adolescence consistently show increased aggressive behavior across studies. Although the behavioral and anatomical profiles of AAS-induced alterations have been well characterized, there is a lack of data describing physiological changes that accompany these alterations. For instance, behavioral pharmacology and neuroanatomical studies show that AAS-induced changes in the vasopressin (AVP) neural system within the latero-anterior hypothalamus (LAH) interact with the serotonin (5HT) and dopamine (DA) systems to modulate aggression. To characterize the electrophysiological profile of the AAS aggression circuit, we recorded LAH neurons in adolescent male hamsters in vivo and microiontophoretically applied agonists and antagonists of aggressive behavior. The interspike interval (ISI) of neurons from AAS-treated animals correlated positively with aggressive behaviors, and adolescent AAS exposure altered parameters of activity in regular firing neurons while also changing the proportion of neuron types (i.e., bursting, regular, irregular). AAS-treated animals had more responsive neurons that were excited by AVP application, while cells from control animals showed the opposite effect and were predominantly inhibited by AVP. Both DA D2 antagonists and 5HT increased the firing frequency of AVP-responsive cells from AAS animals and dual application of AVP and D2 antagonists doubled the excitatory effect of AVP or D2 antagonist administration alone. These data suggest that multiple DA circuits in the LAH modulate AAS-induced aggressive responding. More broadly, these data show that multiple neurochemical interactions at the neurophysiological level are altered by adolescent AAS exposure.

AB  - Abstract
Clinical evidences suggest that an imbalance between descending inhibition and facilitation drives the development of chronic pain. However, potential mechanisms promoting the establishment of a persistent pain state and the increased pain vulnerability remain unknown. This preclinical study was designed to evaluate temporal changes in descending pain modulation at specific experimental endpoints (12, 28, 90 and 168 days) using a novel double-hit model of chronic/tonic pain (first hit: chronic constriction injury (CCI) model; second hit: tonic formalin pain in the contralateral hindpaw). Basal activity of bulbo-spinal monoaminergic systems was further assessed through liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) screening of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We found that CCI-operated rats exhibited a reduced nociceptive response profile, peaking on day 28, when subjected to tonic pain. This behavioral response was accompanied by a rapid increase in basal CSF serotonin and norepinephrine levels 12 days after neuropathy, followed by a return to sham levels on day 28. These molecular and behavioral adaptive changes in descending pain inhibition seemed to slowly fade over time. We therefore suggest that chronic neuropathic pain produces a transient hyperactivation of bulbo-spinal monoaminergic drive when previously primed using a tonic pain paradigm (i.e., formalin test), translating into inhibition of subsequent nociceptive behaviors. Altogether, we propose that early hyperactivation of descending pain inhibitory mechanisms, and its potential ensuing exhaustion, could be part of the temporal neurophysiological chain of events favoring chronic neuropathic pain establishment.

AB  - Abstract
During early postnatal development retinocollicular projections undergo activity-dependent synaptic refinement that results in the formation of precise topographical maps in the visual layers of the superior colliculus (SC). Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) is a widely expressed transmembrane glycoprotein involved in the regulation of several aspects of neural development, such as neurite outgrowth, synapse formation and plasticity. Stimulation of cholinergic system has been found to alter the expression and processing of APP in different cell lines. Herein, we investigated the effect of nicotine on the development of retinocollicular pathway and on APP metabolism in the SC of pigmented rats. Animals were submitted to intracranial Elvax implants loaded with nicotine or phosphate-buffered saline (vehicle) at postnatal day (PND) 7. The ipsilateral retinocollicular pathway of control and experimental groups was anterogradely labeled either 1 or 3 weeks after surgery (PND 14 or PND 28). Local nicotine exposure produces a transitory sprouting of uncrossed retinal axons outside their main terminal zones. Nicotine also increases APP content and its soluble neurotrophic fragment sAPPα. Furthermore, nicotine treatment upregulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α7 and β2 subunits. Taken together, these data indicate that nicotine disrupts the ordering and topographic mapping of axons in the retinocollicular pathway and facilitates APP processing through the nonamyloidogenic pathway, suggesting that sAPPα may act as a trophic agent that mediates nicotine-induced morphological plasticity.

AB  - Abstract
Injury to the sciatic nerve induces loss of sensory neurons in the affected dorsal root ganglia (DRGs). Previous studies have suggested the involvement of the neurotrophin receptors p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) and sortilin, proposing that sensory neuron subpopulations undergo proneurotrophin-induced apoptosis in a similar manner to what can be observed in the CNS following injury. To further investigate this hypothesis we induced sciatic nerve injury in sortilin-deficient mice, thereby preventing apoptotic signaling of proneurotrophins via the sortilin-p75NTR receptor complex. Using an unbiased stereological approach we found that loss of sortilin did not prevent the injury-induced loss of DRG neurons. This result demonstrates that previous findings linking p75NTR and proneurotrophins to loss of sensory neurons need to involve sortilin-independent pathways and suggests that proneurotrophins may elicit different functions in the CNS and PNS.

AB  - Abstract
Transient Receptor Potential Ankyrin 1 and Vanilloid 1 (TRPA1, TRPV1) ion channels expressed on nociceptive primary sensory neurons are important regulators of pain and inflammation. TRPA1 is activated by several inflammatory mediators including formaldehyde and methylglyoxal that are products of the semicarbazide-sensitive amine-oxidase enzyme (SSAO). SZV-1287 is a new 3-(4,5-diphenyl-1,3-oxazol-2-yl)propanal oxime SSAO inhibitor, its chemical structure is similar to other oxime derivatives described as TRPA1 antagonists. Therefore, we investigated its effects on TRPA1 and TRPV1 receptor activation on the cell bodies and peripheral terminals of primary sensory neurons and TRPA1 or TRPV1 receptor-expressing cell lines.

Calcium influx in response to the TRPA1 agonist allyl-isothiocyanate (AITC) (200 μM) and the TRPV1 stimulator capsaicin (330 nM) in rat trigeminal neurons or TRPA1 and TRPV1 receptor-expressing cell lines was measured by microfluorimetry or radioactive 45Ca2+ uptake experiments. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release as the indicator of 100 μM AITC – or 100 nM capsaicin-induced peripheral sensory nerve terminal activation was measured by radioimmunoassay.

SZV-1287 (100, 500 and 1000 nM) exerted a concentration-dependent significant inhibition on both AITC- and capsaicin-evoked calcium influx in trigeminal neurons and TRPA1 or TRPV1 receptor-expressing cell lines. It also significantly inhibited the TRPA1, but not the TRPV1 activation-induced CGRP release from the peripheral sensory nerve endings in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, the reference SSAO inhibitor LJP 1207 with a different structure had no effect on TRPA1 or TRPV1 activation in either model system.

This is the first evidence that our novel oxime compound SZV-1287 originally developed as a SSAO inhibitor has a potent dual antagonistic action on TRPA1 and TRPV1 ion channels on primary sensory neurons.

AB  - Abstract
Microglia have multiple functions in regulating homeostasis in the central nervous system (CNS), and microglial inflammation is thought to play a role in the etiology of the neurodegenerative diseases. When endogenous or exogenous stimuli trigger disorders in microenvironmental homeostasis in CNS, microglia critically determine the fate of other neural cells. Recently, it was reported that autophagy might influence inflammation and activation of microglia. Though the interaction between autophagy and macrophages has been reported and reviewed in length, the role of autophagy in microglia has yet to be reviewed. Herein, we will highlight recent advances on the emerging role of autophagy in microglia, focusing on the regulation of autophagy during microglial inflammation, and the possible mechanism involved.

AB  - Abstract
Astrocytes sense and respond to synaptic activity through activation of different neurotransmitter receptors and transporters. Astrocytes are also coupled by gap junctions, which allow these cells to redistribute through the glial network the K+ ions excessively accumulated at sites of intense neuronal activity. Work over the past two decades has revealed important roles for astrocytes in brain physiology, and it is therefore not surprising that recent studies unveiled their involvement in the etiology of neurological disorders such as epilepsy. Investigation of specimens from patients with pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy and epilepsy models revealed alterations in expression, localization and function of astrocytic connexins, K+ and water channels. In addition, disturbed gliotransmission as well as malfunction of glutamate transporters and of the astrocytic glutamate- and adenosine-converting enzymes – glutamine synthetase and adenosine kinase, respectively – have been observed in epileptic tissues. Accordingly, increasing evidence indicates that dysfunctional astrocytes are crucially involved in processes leading to epilepsy. These new insights might foster the search for new targets for the development of new, more efficient anti-epileptogenic therapies.

AB  - Abstract
Vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 (VGLUT1 and VGLUT2) have distinct distributions in the cochlear nucleus that correspond to sources of the labeled terminals. VGLUT1 is mainly associated with terminals of auditory nerve fibers, whereas VGLUT2 is mainly associated with glutamatergic terminals deriving from other sources that project to the cochlear nucleus (CN), including somatosensory and vestibular terminals. Previous studies in guinea pig have shown that cochlear damage results in a decrease of VGLUT1-labeled puncta and an increase in VGLUT2-labeled puncta. This indicates cross-modal compensation that is of potential importance in somatic tinnitus. To examine whether this effect is consistent across species and to provide a background for future studies, using transgenesis, the current study examines VGLUT expression profiles upon cochlear insult by intracochlear kanamycin injections in the mouse.

Intracochlear kanamycin injections abolished ipsilateral ABR responses in all animals and reduced ipsilateral spiral ganglion neuron densities in animals that were sacrificed after four weeks, but not in animals that were sacrificed after three weeks. In all unilaterally deafened animals, VGLUT1 density was decreased in CN regions that receive auditory nerve fiber terminals, i.e., in the deep layer of the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), in the interstitial region where the auditory nerve enters the CN, and in the magnocellular region of the antero- and posteroventral CN. In contrast, density of VGLUT2 expression was upregulated in the fusiform cell layer of the DCN and in the granule cell lamina, which are known to receive somatosensory and vestibular terminals.

These results show that a cochlear insult induces cross-modal compensation in the cochlear nucleus of the mouse, confirming previous findings in guinea pig, and that these changes are not dependent on the occurrence of spiral ganglion neuron degeneration.

AB  - Abstract
Autophagy, a tightly regulated lysosome-dependent catabolic pathway, is implicated in various pathological states in the nervous system. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is an inflammatory mediator known to be released into the local microenvironment from damaged cells. However, whether autophagy is induced and exogenous HMGB1 is involved in the process of spinal root avulsion remain unclear. Here, we investigated the induction effect of autophagy and the possible role of HMGB1 during spinal root avulsion. It was found that autophagy was activated in the anterior horn of the spinal cord as represented by the increased expression of the autophagic marker microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3-II), degradation of sequestosome 1 (p62), and formation of autophagosomes, and that autophagy was inhibited after intraperitoneal injection of anti-HMGB1-neutralizing antibodies in the rat spinal root avulsion model. In addition, HMGB1-induced autophagy and activated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in primary spinal neurons, including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and p38MAPK. Inhibition of JNK or ERK activity significantly blocked the effect of HMGB1-induced autophagy in primary spinal neurons. Finally, HMGB1-induced autophagy increased cell viability in primary spinal neurons under oxygen-glucose deprivation conditions. The above results suggest that HMGB1 is a critical regulator of autophagy and HMGB1-induced autophagy plays an important role in protecting spinal neurons against injury, which may provide new insights into the pathophysiological process of spinal root avulsion.

AB  - Abstract
The aim of this study was to investigate the role of monoamine neurotransmitters on the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in obese mice. EAE was induced in mice with normal diets (ND-EAE) and obese mice with high-fat diets (HFD-EAE) through the immune response to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) (35–55). The levels of dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and their metabolites in different anatomical brain regions were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The plasma and tissue NADPH oxidase and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-9 activities were analyzed by fluorescence spectrophotometry. The cumulative disease index and disease peaks were significantly higher in HFD-EAE compared with those in ND-EAE. Significantly higher 5-HT levels and lower 5-HT turnovers 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid ((5-HIAA)/5-HT) were found in the brains of HFD-EAE mice compared with those found in the HFD-CON and ND-EAE mice brains. Moreover, increased DA levels were observed in the caudate nucleus of the HFD-EAE mice compared with the control and ND-EAE mice. The NADPH oxidase and MMP-9 activities in the plasma and tissues were significantly higher in both the ND-EAE and HFD-EAE groups than in their respective controls. The cytokine levels in the plasma, tissues, and cultured splenocytes were found to be significantly altered in EAE mice compared with control mice. Moreover, HFD-EAE mice exhibited significantly higher MMP-9 activity and lower IL-4 levels than ND-EAE mice and were significantly correlated with brain 5-HT levels. In conclusion, the increased 5-HT levels in the brain significantly correlated with MMP-9 activity and IL-4 levels play an important role in the exacerbation of disease severity in HFD-EAE mice.

AB  - Abstract
It has previously been shown in rats that acute administration of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) exerts a dose-dependent effect on simple locomotor activity, with low doses of THC causing hyper-locomotion and high doses causing hypo-locomotion. However the effect of acute THC administration on cortical movement representations (motor maps) and skilled learned movements is completely unknown. It is important to determine the effects of THC on motor maps and skilled learned behaviors because behaviors like driving place people at a heightened risk. Three doses of THC were used in the current study: 0.2 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg representing the approximate range of the low to high levels of available THC one would consume from recreational use of cannabis. Acute peripheral administration of THC to drug naïve rats resulted in dose-dependent alterations in motor map expression using high resolution short duration intracortical microstimulation (SD–ICMS). THC at 0.2 mg/kg decreased movement thresholds and increased motor map size, while 1.0 mg/kg had the opposite effect, and 2.5 mg/kg had an even more dramatic effect. Deriving complex movement maps using long duration (LD)–ICMS at 1.0 mg/kg resulted in fewer complex movements. Dosages of 1.0 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg THC reduced the number of reach attempts but did not affect percentage of success or the kinetics of reaching on the single pellet skilled reaching task. Rats that received 2.5 mg/kg THC did show an increase in latency of forelimb removal on the bar task, while dose-dependent effects of THC on unskilled locomotor activity using the rotorod and horizontal ladder tasks were not observed. Rats may be employing compensatory strategies after receiving THC, which may account for the robust changes in motor map expression but moderate effects on behavior.

AB  - Abstract
We use an approach rooted in the recent theory of synergies to analyze possible co-variation between two hypothetical control variables involved in finger force production based on the equilibrium-point (EP) hypothesis. These control variables are the referent coordinate (R) and apparent stiffness (C) of the finger. We tested a hypothesis that inter-trial co-variation in the {R; C} space during repeated, accurate force production trials stabilizes the fingertip force. This was expected to correspond to a relatively low amount of inter-trial variability affecting force and a high amount of variability keeping the force unchanged. We used the “inverse piano” apparatus to apply small and smooth positional perturbations to fingers during force production tasks. Across trials, R and C showed strong co-variation with the data points lying close to a hyperbolic curve. Hyperbolic regressions accounted for over 99% of the variance in the {R; C} space. Another analysis was conducted by randomizing the original {R; C} data sets and creating surrogate data sets that were then used to compute predicted force values. The surrogate sets always showed much higher force variance compared to the actual data, thus reinforcing the conclusion that finger force control was organized in the {R; C} space, as predicted by the EP hypothesis, and involved co-variation in that space stabilizing total force.

AB  - Abstract
Aberrant activation of the developing immune system can have long-term negative consequences on cognition and behavior. Teratogens, such as alcohol, activate microglia, the brain’s resident immune cells, which could contribute to the lifelong deficits in learning and memory observed in humans with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and in rodent models of FASD. The current study investigates the microglial response of the brain 24 h following neonatal alcohol exposure (postnatal days (PDs) 4–9, 5.25 g/kg/day). On PD10, microglial cell counts and area of cell territory were assessed using unbiased stereology in the hippocampal subfields CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG), and hippocampal expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes was analyzed. A significant decrease in microglial cell counts in CA1 and DG was found in alcohol-exposed and sham-intubated (SI) animals compared to undisturbed suckle controls (SCs), suggesting overlapping effects of alcohol exposure and intubation alone on the neuroimmune response. Cell territory was decreased in alcohol-exposed animals in CA1, CA3, and DG compared to controls, suggesting the microglia have shifted to a more activated state following alcohol treatment. Furthermore, both alcohol-exposed and SI animals had increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, CD11b, and CCL4; in addition, CCL4 was significantly increased in alcohol-exposed animals compared to SI as well. Alcohol-exposed animals also showed increased levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-β compared to both SI and SCs. In summary, the number and activation of microglia in the neonatal hippocampus are both affected in a rat model of FASD, along with increased gene expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. This study shows that alcohol exposure during development induces a neuroimmune response, potentially contributing to long-term alcohol-related changes to cognition, behavior and immune function.

AB  - Abstract
Neurons containing the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) enzyme are located in brain areas related to defensive behavior, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC). Rats exposed to a live predator (a cat) present anxiety-like behavior and an increased number of nNOS-positive neurons in this brain area one-week later. Moreover, stress-related behavioral changes in rodents can be prevented by systemic or local vMPFC nNOS inhibition. In the present study we investigated if acute restraint stress (RS)-induced delayed (one-week) anxiogenic-like effect was associated with increased nNOS expression or activity in the vMPFC. Furthermore, we also tested if local pharmacological nNOS inhibition would prevent stress-induced behavioral changes. Male Wistar rats were submitted to RS for 3 h and tested in the elevated plus maze (EPM) 24 h or 7 days later. Two hours after the EPM test, their brains were removed, processed and nNOS expression in the vMPFC was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Another group of animals was used for measuring NO metabolites (NOx; an indirect measure of NOS activity) immediately after the EPM test, 24 h after RS. Independent groups had guide cannula implanted bilaterally into the prelimbic (PL) portion of vMPFC. Five to six days after surgery, the animals were submitted to RS and 24 h later received local administration of the nNOS inhibitor, N-propyl-l-arginine (NPLA; 0.04 nmol). They were tested in the EPM 10 min later. RS-induced anxiogenic-like effect was accompanied by increased nNOS expression in the PL (p &lt; 0.05), but not in the infralimbic (IL) vMPFC, both 24 h and 7 days after RS. Moreover, open-arm exploration of the EPM was negatively correlated with nNOS expression (p &lt; 0.05) and NOx levels (p &lt; 0.05) in the PL. The anxiogenic-like effect observed 24 h after RS was prevented by NPLA (p &lt; 0.05). Our results suggest that RS-induced anxiogenic-like effect might depend on increased nNOS-mediated signaling in the PL MPFC.

AB  - Abstract
Monoamine neurotransmitter, serotonin (5-HT) has its own specific receptors in both pre- and post-synapse. In the present study the role of carnosine on aging-induced changes of [3H]-5-HT receptor binding in different brain regions in a rat model was studied. The results showed that during aging (18 and 24 months) the [3H]-5-HT receptor binding was reduced in hippocampus, hypothalamus and pons-medulla with a decrease in their both Bmax and KD but in cerebral cortex the [3H]-5-HT binding was increased with the increase of its only Bmax. The aging-induced changes in [3H]-5-HT receptor binding with carnosine (2.0 μg/kg/day, intrathecally, for 21 consecutive days) attenuated in (a) 24-month-aged rats irrespective of the brain regions with the attenuation of its Bmax except hypothalamus where both Bmax and KD were significantly attenuated, (b) hippocampus and hypothalamus of 18-month-aged rats with the attenuation of its Bmax, and restored toward the [3H]-5-HT receptor binding that observed in 4-month-young rats. The decrease in pons-medullary [3H]-5-HT binding including its Bmax of 18-month-aged rats was promoted with carnosine without any significant change in its cerebral cortex. The [3H]-5-HT receptor binding with the same dosages of carnosine in 4-month-young rats (a) increased in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus with the increase in their only Bmax whereas (b) decreased in hypothalamus and pons-medulla with a decrease in their both Bmax and KD. These results suggest that carnosine treatment may (a) play a preventive role in aging-induced brain region-specific changes in serotonergic activity (b) not be worthy in 4-month-young rats in relation to the brain regional serotonergic activity.

AB  - Abstract
This study was designed to investigate brain connections among chemosensitive areas in newborn rats. Rhodamine beads were injected unilaterally into the locus coeruleus (LC) or into the caudal part of the nucleus tractus solitarius (cNTS) in Sprague–Dawley rat pups (P7–P10). Rhodamine-labeled neurons were patched in brainstem slices to study their electrophysiological responses to hypercapnia and to determine if chemosensitive neurons are communicating between LC and cNTS regions. After 7–10 days, retrograde labeling was observed in numerous areas of the brainstem, including many chemosensitive regions, such as the contralateral LC, cNTS and medullary raphe. Whole-cell patch clamp was done in cNTS. In 4 of 5 retrogradely labeled cNTS neurons that projected to the LC, firing rate increased in response to hypercapnic acidosis (15% CO2), even in synaptic blockade medium (SNB) (high Mg2+/low Ca2+). In contrast, 2 of 3 retrogradely labeled LC neurons that projected to cNTS had reduced firing rate in response to hypercapnic acidosis, both in the presence and absence of SNB. Extensive anatomical connections among chemosensitive brainstem regions in newborn rats were found and at least for the LC and cNTS, the connections involve some CO2-sensitive neurons. Such anatomical and functional coupling suggests a complex central respiratory control network, such as seen in adult rats, is already largely present in neonatal rats by at least day P7–P10. Since the NTS and the LC play a major role in memory consolidation, our results may also contribute to the understanding of the development of memory consolidation.

AB  - Abstract
Sensorineural hearing loss, as a consequence of acoustic trauma, aging, genetic defects or ototoxic drugs, is highly associated with irreversible damage of cochlear hair cells (HCs) and secondary degeneration of spiral ganglion (SG) cells. Cochlear implants (CIs), which bypass the lost HC function by direct electrical stimulation of the remaining auditory neurons, offer an effective therapy option. Several studies imply that components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) have a great impact on the adhesion and growth of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) during development. Based on these findings, ECM proteins might act as bioactive CI substrates to optimize the electrode–nerve interface and to improve efficacy of these implants.

In the present study, we focused on the ECM glycoproteins Tenascin-C (TN-C), Laminin (LN), and Fibronectin (FN), which show a prominent expression along the growth route of SGNs and the niche around HCs during murine postnatal development in vivo. We compared their influence on adhesion, neurite length, and neurite number of SGNs in vitro. Moreover, we studied the expression of the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) dermatan sulfate-dependent proteoglycan-1 (DSD-1-PG), an interaction partner of TN-C.

In sum, our in vitro data suggest that TN-C acts as an anti-adhesive and inhibitory factor for the growth of SGNs. The DSD-1 carbohydrate epitope is specifically localized to HC stereocilia and SG fibers. Interestingly, TN-C and the DSD-1-PG exhibit a mutually exclusive expression pattern, with the exception of a very restricted region beneath the habenula perforata, where SG neurites grow through the basilar membrane (BM) toward the HCs. The complementary expression of TN-C, LN, FN, and the DSD-1 epitope suggests that TN-C may act as an important boundary formation molecule in the developing postnatal mouse inner ear, which makes it a promising candidate to regulate neurite outgrowth in the light of CIs.

AB  - Abstract
The tumor necrosis factor like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) and its receptor, fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14), mediate inflammation and neuronal apoptosis in cerebral edema, ischemic stroke and multiple sclerosis. The downstream effectors and pathways linked to TWEAK–Fn14 signaling are strongly implicated in the pathology of Parkinson’s disease (PD), thus indicating a putative role for TWEAK/Fn14 signaling in PD neurodegeneration. Using the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model, we aimed to determine whether genetic ablation or pharmacologic mitigation of the TWEAK protein and its Fn14 receptor affected substantia nigra and striatum Parkinsonian pathology. Changes in endogenous TWEAK protein expression were also quantified in tissue from both MPTP-treated mice and PD human samples.

TWEAK protein expression was transiently increased in the striatal tissue but remained unaltered in substantia nigra tissue of MPTP-treated mice. There was also no change of TWEAK protein levels in the substantia nigra or the striatum of human PD patients as compared to matched control subjects. Mitigating the effects of endogenous TWEAK protein using neutralizing antibody did affect MPTP-mediated neurotoxicity in the substantia nigra using the sub-acute model of MPTP (30 mg/kg i.p. over five consecutive days). Neither TWEAK nor Fn14 genetic ablation led to attenuation of MPTP-toxicity in the acute model.

These findings suggest that TWEAK signaling might be an aspect of MPTP-mediated neuropathology and be involved in the overall neurodegenerative pathology of PD.

AB  - Abstract
Schizophrenia is conceptualized as a neurodevelopmental disorder in which developmental alterations in immature brain systems are not clear. Rats with neonatal ventral hippocampal lesions (NVHL) can exhibit schizophrenia-like behaviors, and these rats have been widely used to study the developmental mechanisms of schizophrenia. The nuclear restricted protein/brain (NRP/B) is a nuclear matrix protein that is critical for the normal development of the neuronal system. This study assessed the effect of NVHL induced by the administration of ibotenic acid on the protein expression of NRP/B in the hippocampus, cortex and striatum in pre- and post-pubertal rats. The expressions of NeuN in various developmental periods were assessed accordingly. Sprague–Dawley rat pups were administered ibotenic acid at postnatal day (PD) 7. Western blotting and an immunofluorescence staining analysis showed that the expression of NRP/B was significantly decreased in the hippocampus, cortex and striatum of the NVHL rats at PD14, 28 and 42. The expressions of NeuN were decreased accordingly. In vitro experiment showed the NRP/B knockdown can decrease the Tuj1 expression in cultured cortical neurons. The data suggest that NVHL induces a change in NRP/B expression that affects neurons in the developmental period.

AB  - Abstract
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are abundant in the central nervous system and have a key role in brain function as well as many neurological disorders. However, the regulatory function of lncRNAs in the premature brain has not been well studied. This study described the expression profile of lncRNAs in premature mice using microarray technology. 1999 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 955 differentially expressed mRNAs were identified. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analysis showed that these lncRNAs were involved in multiple biological processes, including the nervous system development and inflammatory response. Additionally, the lncRNA-mRNA-network and TF-gene-lncRNA-network were constructed to identify core regulatory lncRNAs and transcription factors. The sex-determining region of Y chromosome (SRY) gene may be a key transcription factor that regulates premature brain development and injury. This study for the first time represents an expression profile of differentially expressed lncRNAs in the premature brain and may provide a novel point of view into the mechanisms of premature brain injury.

AB  - Abstract
Aquaporin-4 (AQP4), a water-selective membrane transport protein, is up-regulated in astrocytes in various inflammatory lesions, including Parkinson disease (PD). However, the exact functional roles of AQP4 in neuroinflammation remain unknown. In the present study, we investigated how AQP4 participates in the neuroinflammation of PD using AQP4 knockout (KO) mice and astrocyte–microglial co-cultures. We found that AQP4 KO mice exhibited increased basal and inducible canonical NF-κB activity, and showed significantly enhanced gliosis (astrocytosis and microgliosis) in chronic MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)/probenecid PD models, companying with the increase in the production of IL-1β and TNF-α in the midbrain. Similarly, AQP4 deficiency augmented the activation of the NF-κB pathway and the production of IL-1β and TNF-α in midbrain astrocyte cultures treated with MPP+ (1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium). Furthermore, AQP4 deficiency promoted activation of microglial cells in the co-cultured system. Our data provide the first evidence that AQP4 modulates astrocyte-to-microglia communication in neuroinflammation, although its effect on astrocyte inflammatory activation remains to be explored.

AB  - Abstract
The neuroimmune-endocrine dysfunction has been accepted as one of fundamental mechanisms contributing to the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the involvement of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, interleukin-1β, and nitrergic system in mediating the negative behavioral impacts of juvenile social isolation stress (SIS) in male mice. We also investigated the possible protective effects of lithium on behavioral and neurochemical changes in socially isolated animals. Results showed that experiencing 4-weeks of juvenile SIS provoked depressive and anxiety-like behaviors that were associated with hyper responsiveness of HPA axis, upregulation of interleukin-1β, and nitric oxide (NO) overproduction in the pre-frontal cortex and hippocampus. Administration of lithium (10 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the depressant and anxiogenic effects of SIS in behavioral tests. Lithium also restored the negative effects of SIS on cortical and hippocampal interleukin-1β and NO as well as HPA axis deregulation. Unlike the neutralizing effects of l-arginine (NO precursor), administration of l-NAME (3 mg/kg) and aminoguanidine (20 mg/kg) potentiated the positive effects of lithium on the behavioral and neurochemical profile of isolated mice. In conclusion, our results revealed that juvenile SIS-induced behavioral deficits are associated with abnormalities in HPA-immune function. Also, we suggest that alleviating effects of lithium on behavioral profile of isolated mice may be partly mediated by mitigating the negative impact of NO on HPA-immune function.

AB  - Abstract
Recent research points to diversification in the local neuronal circuitry between dorsal (DH) and ventral (VH) hippocampus that may be involved in the large-scale functional segregation along the long axis of the hippocampus. Here, using CA1 field recordings from rat hippocampal slices, we show that activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) reduced excitatory transmission more in VH than in DH, with an adenosine A1 receptor-independent mechanism, and reduced inhibition and enhanced postsynaptic excitability only in DH. Strikingly, co-activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor-5 (mGluR5) with NMDAR, by CHPG and NMDA respectively, strongly potentiated the effects of NMDAR in DH but had not any potentiating effect in VH. Furthermore, the synergistic actions in DH were occluded by blockade of adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs) by their antagonist ZM 241385 demonstrating a tonic action of these receptors in DH. Exogenous activation of A2ARs by 4-[2-[[6-amino-9-(N-ethyl-β-D-ribofuranuronamidosyl)-9H-purin-2-yl]amino]ethyl]benzenepropanoic acid hydrochloride (CGS 21680) did not change the effects of mGluR5–NMDAR co-activation in either hippocampal pole. Importantly, blockade of cannabinoid CB1 receptors (CB1Rs) by their antagonist 1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-4-methyl-N-4-morpholinyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (AM 281) restricted the synergistic actions of mGluR5–NMDARs on excitatory synaptic transmission and postsynaptic excitability and abolished their effect on inhibition. Furthermore, AM 281 increased the excitatory transmission only in DH indicating that CB1Rs were tonically active in DH but not VH. Removing the magnesium ions from the perfusion medium neither stimulated the interaction between mGluR5 and NMDAR in VH nor augmented the synergy of the two receptors in DH. These findings show that the NMDAR-dependent modulation of fundamental parameters of the local neuronal network, by mGluR5, A2AR and CB1R, markedly differs between DH and VH. We propose that the higher modulatory role of A2AR and mGluR5, in combination with the role of CB1Rs, provide DH with higher functional flexibility of its NMDARs, compared with VH.

AB  - Abstract
Excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) is one important subtype of the excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs), and its absence can increase the vulnerability to oxidative stress in neural tissue. Enhanced expression of EAAC1 can provide neuroprotection in multiple disorders, including ischemia and multiple sclerosis. However, the mechanism regulating EAAC1 expression is not fully understood. Using rat C6 astroglial cells, which specifically express EAAC1, we found that 17β-estradiol (E2) and (±)-1-[(3aR∗,4S∗,9bS∗)-4-(6-bromo-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-3a,4,5,9b-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinolin-8-yl]-ethanone (G1), an agonist of the G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPR30), strongly increased EAAC1 protein levels and protected cells from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) toxicity. We further found that E2/G1 activated sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) via GPR30, resulting in the transcription of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), which stimulated its receptor (FGFR) and led to the phosphorylation of FGFR substrate 2α (FRS2α). This triggered downstream ERK1/2 signaling for the expression of EAAC1. Both the knockdown of FGF2 by siRNA and the pharmacological suppression of the FGFR–ERK cascade abolished the E2/G1 effect on EAAC1 expression. Overall, our work characterizes a signaling pathway by which E2 transactivates FGFR–ERK to induce EAAC1 expression in an FGF2-dependent manner. This occurs through SphK1 activation via GPR30 and leads to a resistance to H2O2 toxicity. This signal transduction pathway may provide novel insights into our understanding of the neuroprotective effects of E2 and may reveal new therapeutic targets or drugs for regulating the oxidative toxicity effects of various neurological diseases.

AB  - Abstract
The inspiratory motor outputs are larger in the intercostal muscles positioned at more rostral segments. To obtain further insights into the involvement of the spinal interneurons in the generation of this rostrocaudal gradient, the respiratory-related neuronal activities were optically recorded from various thoracic segments in brainstem–spinal cord preparations from 0- to 2-day-old rats. The preparation was stained with a voltage-sensitive dye, and the optical signals from about 2.5 s before to about 7.7 s after the peak of the C4 inspiratory discharge were obtained. Respiratory-related depolarizing signals were detectable from the ventral surface of all thoracic segments. Since the local blockage of the synaptic transmission in the thoracic spinal cord induced by the low-Ca2+ superfusate blocked all respiratory signals, it is likely that these signals came from spinal neurons. Under the-low Ca2+ superfusate, ventral root stimulation, inducing antidromic activation of motoneurons, evoked depolarizing optical signals in a restricted middle area between the lateral edge and midline of the spinal cord. These areas were referred to as ‘motoneuron areas’. The respiratory signals were observed not only in the motoneuron areas but also in areas medial to the motoneuron areas, where interneurons should exist; these were referred to as ‘interneuron areas’. The upper thoracic segments showed significantly larger inspiratory-related signals than the lower thoracic segments in both the motoneuron and interneuron areas. These results suggest that the inspiratory interneurons in the thoracic spinal cord play a role in the generation of the rostrocaudal gradient in the inspiratory intercostal muscle activity.

AB  - Abstract
Reactivation of consolidated memory initiates a memory reconsolidation process, during which the reactivated memory is susceptible to strengthening, weakening or updating. Therefore, effective interference with the memory reconsolidation process is expected to be an important treatment for drug addiction. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been well recognized as a pathway component that can prevent drug relapse, although the mechanism underlying this function is poorly understood. We aimed to clarify the regulatory role of the NAc in the cocaine memory reconsolidation process, by examining the effect of applying different pharmacological interventions to the NAc on Zif 268 and Fos B expression in the entire reward circuit after cocaine memory reactivation. Through the cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) model, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining for Zif 268 and Fos B were used to explore the functional activated brain nuclei after cocaine memory reactivation. Our results showed that the expression of Zif 268 and Fos B was commonly increased in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the infralimbic cortex (IL), the NAc-core, the NAc-shell, the hippocampus (CA1, CA2, and CA3 subregions), the amygdala, the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and the supramammillary nucleus (SuM) following memory reconsolidation, and Zif 268/Fos B co-expression was commonly observed (for Zif 268: 51–68%; for Fos B: 52–66%). Further, bilateral NAc-shell infusion of MK 801 and SCH 23390, but not raclopride or propranolol, prior to addictive memory reconsolidation, decreased Zif 268 and Fos B expression in the entire reward circuit, except for the amygdala, and effectively disturbed subsequent CPP-related behavior. In summary, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and dopamine D1 receptors, but not dopamine D2 or β adrenergic receptors, within the NAc-shell, may regulate Zif 268 and Fos B expression in most brain nuclei of the reward circuit after cocaine memory reactivation. These findings indicated that the NAc played a key role in regulating addictive memory reconsolidation by influencing the function of the entire addictive memory network.

AB  - Abstract
Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common neurologic disorders often associated with behavioral impairments and cognitive deficit. Lithium–pilocarpine model of seizures in rodents reproduces many features of human convulsive status epilepticus (SE) and subsequent TLE. In this study, we have investigated changes in the rat brain after lithium–pilocarpine SE using a high-field MRI system for small animals in early and chronic periods after SE. We have studied the relationship between T2 relaxation time measured in these periods and the development of behavioral exploratory response to novelty and habituation in the open field test. A significant increase in T2 in the hippocampus and associated structures was found 2 days after SE and practically resolved by day seven, while an increase in T2 in the parietal and prefrontal cortex appeared 30 days after SE. High T2 values in the parietal cortex and thalamus on day two after SE were associated with an increased mortality risk. A substantial variability in T2 relaxation time was observed in the hippocampus and amygdala 30 days after SE. Rats survived after SE showed locomotor hyperactivity and disruption of long-term habituation in the open field test carried out 5 weeks after the seizures. Interestingly, T2 in the amygdala 30 days after SE had a strong correlation with hyperactivity in the novel open field. Therefore, the amygdala damage may be an important factor in the development of hyperactivity in the chronic period after SE.

AB  - Abstract
Creatine supplementation has been shown to protect neurons from oxidative damage due to its antioxidant and ergogenic functions. These features have led to the hypothesis of creatine supplementation use during pregnancy as prophylactic treatment to prevent CNS damage, such as hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy. Unfortunately, very little is known on the effects of creatine supplementation during neuron differentiation, while in vitro studies revealed an influence on neuron excitability, leaving the possibility of creatine supplementation during the CNS development an open question. Using a multiple approach, we studied the hippocampal neuron morphological and functional development in neonatal rats born by dams supplemented with 1% creatine in drinking water during pregnancy.

CA1 pyramidal neurons of supplemented newborn rats showed enhanced dendritic tree development, increased LTP maintenance, larger evoked-synaptic responses, and higher intrinsic excitability in comparison to controls. Moreover, a faster repolarizing phase of action potential with the appearance of a hyperpolarization were recorded in neurons of the creatine-treated group. Consistently, CA1 neurons of creatine exposed pups exhibited a higher maximum firing frequency than controls.

In summary, we found that creatine supplementation during pregnancy positively affects morphological and electrophysiological development of CA1 neurons in offspring rats, increasing neuronal excitability. Altogether, these findings emphasize the need to evaluate the benefits and the safety of maternal intake of creatine in humans.

AB  - Abstract
Delta opioid (DOP) receptors participate to the control of chronic pain and emotional responses. Recent data also identified their implication in spatial memory and drug-context associations pointing to a critical role of hippocampal delta receptors. To better appreciate the impact of repeated drug exposure on their modulatory activity, we used fluorescent knock-in mice that express a functional delta receptor fused at its carboxy-terminus with the green fluorescent protein in place of the native receptor. We then tested the impact of chronic morphine treatment on the density and distribution of delta receptor-expressing cells in the hippocampus. A decrease in delta receptor-positive cell density was observed in the CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus without alteration of the distribution across the different GABAergic populations that mainly express delta receptors. This effect partly persisted after four weeks of morphine abstinence. In addition, we observed increased DOP receptor expression at the cell surface compared to saline-treated animals. In the hippocampus, chronic morphine administration thus induces DOP receptor cellular redistribution and durably decreases delta receptor-expressing cell density. Such modifications are likely to alter hippocampal physiology, and to contribute to long-term cognitive deficits.

AB  - Abstract
The involvement of testosterone in pain, inflammation, and analgesia has been reported, but the role of androgen receptor (AR), a steroid receptor for testosterone, is not well understood. We have previously shown that peripheral inflammation upregulates μ-opioid receptor (MOR) in rat trigeminal ganglia (TG) in a testosterone-dependent manner. In this study, we hypothesized that testosterone regulates MOR expression via transcriptional activities of AR in TG. We first examined whether AR is co-expressed with MOR in TG neurons. Our immunohistochemical experiment revealed that AR staining is detected in neurons of all sizes in TG and that a subset of AR is expressed in MOR as well as in TRPV1-positive neurons. We identified the promoter region of the rat MOR gene contains putative AR binding sites. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we demonstrated that AR directly binds to these sites in TG extracts. We confirmed with luciferase reporter assay that AR activated the MOR promoter in response to androgens in a human neuroblastoma cell line (5H-5YSY). These data demonstrated that AR functions as a transcriptional regulator of the MOR gene activity. Finally, we showed that flutamide, a specific AR antagonist, prevents complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA)-induced upregulation of MOR mRNA in TG, and that flutamide dose-dependently blocks the efficacy of DAMGO, a specific MOR agonist, on CFA-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. Our results expand the knowledge regarding the role of androgens and their receptor in pain and analgesia and have important clinical implications, particularly for inflammatory pain patients with low or compromised plasma testosterone levels.

AB  - Abstract
While variability of the motor responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is widely acknowledged, little is known about its central origin. One plausible explanation for such variability may relate to different neuronal states defining the reactivity of the cortex to TMS. In this study intrinsic spatio-temporal neuronal dynamics were estimated with Long-Range Temporal Correlations (LRTC) in order to predict the inter-individual differences in the strength of intra-cortical facilitation (ICF) and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) produced by paired-pulse TMS (ppTMS) of the left primary motor cortex. LRTC in the alpha frequency range were assessed from multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) obtained at rest before and after the application of and single-pulse TMS (spTMS) and ppTMS protocols. For the EEG session, preceding TMS application, we showed a positive correlation across subjects between the strength of ICF and LRTC in the fronto-central and parietal areas. This in turn attests to the existence of subject-specific neuronal phenotypes defining the reactivity of the brain to ppTMS. In addition, we also showed that ICF was associated with the changes in neuronal dynamics in the EEG session after the application of the stimulation. This result provides a complementary evidence for the recent findings demonstrating that the cortical stimulation with sparse non-regular stimuli might have considerable long-lasting effects on the cortical activity.

AB  - Abstract
Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a transitional state between normal aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Non-invasive diagnostic methods are desirable to identify MCI for early therapeutic interventions. In this study, we proposed a support vector machine (SVM)-based method to discriminate between MCI patients and normal controls (NCs) using multi-level characteristics of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This method adopted a radial basis function (RBF) as the kernel function, and a grid search method to optimize the two parameters of SVM. The calculated characteristics, i.e., the Hurst exponent (HE), amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo) and gray matter density (GMD), were adopted as the classification features. A leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was used to evaluate the classification performance of the method. Applying the proposed method to the experimental data from 29 MCI patients and 33 healthy subjects, we achieved a classification accuracy of up to 96.77%, with a sensitivity of 93.10% and a specificity of 100%, and the area under the curve (AUC) yielded up to 0.97. Furthermore, the most discriminative features for classification were found to predominantly involve default-mode regions, such as hippocampus (HIP), parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG) and middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and subcortical regions such as lentiform nucleus (LN) and amygdala (AMYG). Therefore, our method is promising in distinguishing MCI patients from NCs and may be useful for the diagnosis of MCI.

AB  - Abstract
Sensorimotor adaptation can be induced by action observation, and also by passive training. Here, we investigated the effect of a protocol that combined action observation and passive training on visuomotor adaptation, by comparing it with the effect of action observation or passive training alone. Subjects were divided into five conditions during the training session: (1) action observation, in which the subjects watched a video of a model who adapted to a novel visuomotor rotation; (2) proprioceptive training, in which the subject’s arm was moved passively to target locations that were associated with desired trajectories; (3) combined training, in which the subjects watched the video of a model during a half of the session and experienced passive movements during the other half; (4) active training, in which the subjects adapted actively to the rotation; and (5) a control condition, in which the subjects did not perform any task. Following that session, all subjects adapted to the same visuomotor rotation. Results showed that the subjects in the combined training condition adapted to the rotation significantly better than those in the observation or proprioceptive training condition, although their performance was not as good as that of those who adapted actively. These findings suggest that although a protocol that combines action observation and passive training consists of all the processes involved in active training (error detection and correction, effector-specific and proprioceptively based reaching movements), these processes in that protocol may work differently as compared to a protocol in which the same processes are engaged actively.

AB  - Abstract
Purinergic P2X3 receptors (P2X3Rs) play an important role in pain pathologies, including migraine. In trigeminal neurons, P2X3Rs are constitutively downregulated by endogenous brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). In a mouse knock-in (KI) model of familial hemiplegic migraine type-1 with upregulated calcium CaV2.1 channel function, trigeminal neurons exhibit hyperexcitability with gain-of-function of P2X3Rs and their deficient BNP-mediated inhibition. We studied whether the absent BNP-induced control over P2X3Rs activity in KI cultures may be functionally expressed in altered firing activity of KI trigeminal neurons.

Patch-clamp experiments investigated the excitability of wild-type and KI trigeminal neurons induced by either current or agonists for P2X3Rs or transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) receptors. Consistent with the constitutive inhibition of P2X3Rs by BNP, sustained pharmacological block of BNP receptors selectively enhanced P2X3R-mediated excitability of wild-type neurons without affecting firing evoked by the other protocols. This effect included increased number of action potentials, lower spike threshold and shift of the firing pattern distribution toward higher spiking activity. Thus, inactivation of BNP signaling transformed the wild-type excitability phenotype into the one typical for KI. BNP receptor block did not influence excitability of KI neurons in accordance with the lack of BNP-induced P2X3R modulation. Our study suggests that, in wild-type trigeminal neurons, negative control over P2X3Rs by the BNP pathway is translated into tonic suppression of P2X3Rs-mediated excitability. Lack of this inhibition in KI cultures results in a hyperexcitability phenotype and might contribute to facilitated trigeminal pain transduction relevant for migraine.

AB  - Abstract
Sigma-1 receptor (S1R) is a unique pluripotent modulator of living systems and has been reported to be associated with a number of neurological diseases including pathological pain. Intrathecal administration of S1R antagonists attenuates the pain behavior of rodents in both inflammatory and neuropathic pain models. However, the S1R localization in the spinal cord shows a selective ventral horn motor neuron distribution, suggesting the high likelihood of S1R in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) mediating the pain relief by intrathecally administered drugs. Since primary afferents are the major component in the pain pathway, we examined the mouse and rat DRGs for the presence of the S1R. At both mRNA and protein levels, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western confirmed that the DRG contains greater S1R expression in comparison to spinal cord, cortex, or lung but less than liver. Using a custom-made highly specific antibody, we demonstrated the presence of a strong S1R immuno-fluorescence in all rat and mouse DRG neurons co-localizing with the Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE) marker, but not in neural processes or GFAP-positive glial satellite cells. In addition, S1R was absent in afferent terminals in the skin and in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Using immuno-electron microscopy, we showed that S1R is detected in the nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of DRG cells. In contrast to other cells, S1R is also located directly at the plasma membrane of the DRG neurons. The presence of S1R in the nuclear envelope of all DRG neurons suggests an exciting potential role of S1R as a regulator of neuronal nuclear activities and/or gene expression, which may provide insight toward new molecular targets for modulating nociception at the level of primary afferent neurons.

AB  - Abstract
Xylene and its derivatives are raw materials widely used in industry and known to be toxic to animals. However, the mechanism underlying the neurotoxicity of para-xylene (PX) to the central nervous system (CNS) in vivo is less clear. Here, we exposed Xenopus laevis tadpoles to sub-lethal concentrations of PX during the critical period of brain development to determine the effects of PX on Xenopus development and visual behavior. We found that the abnormality rate was significantly increased with exposure to increasing concentrations of PX. In particular, the number of apoptotic cells in the optic tectum was dramatically increased with exposure to PX at 2 mM. Long-term PX exposure also resulted in significant deficits in visually guided avoidance behavior. Strikingly, co-incubation with PX and d-glucuronolactone (GA) decreased the number of apoptotic cells and rescued the avoidance behavior. Furthermore, we found that the acetylation of H4K12 (H4K12ac) and the dimethylation of H3K9 (H3K9me2) in the optic tectum were significantly increased in PX-treated animals, and these effects were suppressed by GA treatment. In particular, the increase in apoptotic cells in PX-treated brains was also inhibited by GA treatment. These effects indicate that epigenetic regulation plays a key role in PX-induced apoptosis and animal behavior. In an effort to characterize the neurotoxic effects of PX on brain development and behavior, these results suggest that the neurotoxicity of PX requires further evaluation regarding the safety of commercial and industrial uses.

Purpose: To investigate the neuroprotective role of sodium valproate (VPA) in a hippocampal neuronal cell line (HT22) and the hippocampus of zebrafish after exposure to radiation. Methods: We investigated whether VPA could protect HT22 hippocampal neurons and the hippocampus of zebrafish from radiation-induced injury. We measured the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the mitochondrial membrane potential, the levels of glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA), and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). The expression of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was also measured. The cognitive behavior of the zebrafish was evaluated 1 month after radiation exposure. Results: VPA treatment improved the survival rate (300 mg/kg body weight (BW) VPA: 76.67%; 100 mg/kg BW VPA: 56.7%) of zebrafish 1 month after exposure to a lethal dose of whole-body irradiation (P &lt; 0.01). VPA treatment decreased the ROS generation (P &lt; 0.01), decreased the MDA levels (P &lt; 0.01), increased the GSH levels (P &lt; 0.01) and increased the SOD activity (P &lt; 0.01). VPA treatment activated the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, increased the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and increased the mRNA (P &lt; 0.01) and protein expression of HO-1 to prevent radiation-induced neuronal injury. SiRNA knockdown of the Nrf2 gene prevented the VPA-induced attenuation of radiation injury in the HT22 neuronal cells that was found in the control cells (40.09 ± 1.76% vs. 41.14 ± 1.09%, P &gt; 0.05). VPA also improved the zebrafish cognitive behavior after radiation-induced neuronal injury as measured by the exploration test (control 5.74 ± 1.42 min vs. radiation therapy 16.39 ± 4.03 min vs. radiation therapy plus VPA 7.18 ± 1.79 min, P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: ROS generation after radiation exposure contributes to DNA damage in the zebrafish brain. VPA inhibits ROS generation by activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, which improves cognitive behavior following radiation-induced neuronal injury.

AB  - Abstract
Chemosensory stimuli from conspecific and heterospecific animals, elicit categorically different immediate-early gene response-patterns in medial amygdala in male hamsters and mice. We previously showed that conspecific signals activate posterior (MeP) as well as anterior medial amygdala (MeA), and especially relevant heterospecific signals such as chemosensory stimuli from potential predators also activate MeP in mice. Other heterospecific chemosignals activate MeA, but not MeP. Here we show that male hamster amygdala responds significantly differentially to different conspecific signals, by activating different proportions of cells of different phenotype, possibly leading to differential activation of downstream circuits. Heterospecific signals that fail to activate MeP do activate GABA-immunoreactive cells in the adjacent caudal main intercalated nucleus (mICNc) and elicit selective suppression of MeP cells bearing GABA-Receptors, suggesting GABA inhibition in MeP by GABAergic cells in mICNc. Overall, work presented here suggests that medial amygdala may discriminate between important conspecific social signals, distinguish them from the social signals of other species and convey that information to brain circuits eliciting appropriate social behavior.

AB  - Abstract
Microglial cells are the pivotal immune cells of the central nervous system. Adult microglia cells under physiological conditions are in a ramification state with extensively branched processes. Upon disease stimulation, they retract their processes and become activated. Induction of ramification is an attracting strategy to terminate the excessive activation of microglia. Here, we investigated the influence of compound C (CC) on microglial shape. Results showed that CC reversibly induced a ramification of murine microglia in both basal and inflammatory conditions. These pro-ramification effects were independent of adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibition as both AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 silence failed to induce microglial ramification. The ramification state of microglia induced by CC was associated with a decrease in pro-inflammatory factors and an increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) protein and phagocytic activity. Mechanistic studies confirmed that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–protein kinase B (Akt) signal, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) or small RhoGTPase activation mediated the effect of CC on microglial shape change based on the following observations: (i) CC induced a significant activation of the small RhoGTPase Rac1 and Cdc42; (ii) CC promoted the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt; (iii) inhibition of Rac1, Cdc42, ERK1/2, or the PI3K–Akt signal abolished the effect of CC on microglial shape change. These signal mechanisms were also ascertained in primary microglia. Our results explore a potential agent that promotes microglial ramification, and provide an alternative explanation for the neuroprotective effects of CC in various disease models such as brain ischemia and subarachnoid hemorrhage.

AB  - Abstract
The planning of any motor action requires a complex multisensory processing by the brain. Gravity – immutable on Earth – has been shown to be a key input to these mechanisms. Seminal fMRI studies performed during visual perception of falling objects and self-motion demonstrated that humans represent the action of gravity in parts of the cortical vestibular system; in particular, the insular cortex and the cerebellum. However, little is known as to whether a specific neural network is engaged when processing non-visual signals relevant to gravity. We asked participants to perform vertical and horizontal hand movements without visual control, while lying in a 3T-MRI scanner. We highlighted brain regions activated in the processing of vertical movements, for which the effects of gravity changed during execution. Precisely, the left insula was activated in vertical movements and not in horizontal movements. Moreover, the network identified by contrasting vertical and horizontal movements overlapped with neural correlates previously associated to the processing of simulated self-motion and visual perception of the vertical direction. Interestingly, we found that the insular cortex activity is direction-dependent which suggests that this brain region processes the effects of gravity on the moving limbs through non-visual signals.

AB  - Abstract
In humans, bromocriptine (BRO) is used as a treatment for many disorders, such as prolactinomas, even during pregnancy and lactation. Previously we demonstrated that maternal BRO treatment at the end of lactation programs offspring for obesity and several endocrine dysfunctions. Here, we studied the long-term effects of direct BRO injection in neonatal Wistar rats on their dopaminergic pathway, anxiety-like behavior and locomotor activity at adulthood. Male pups were either s.c. injected with BRO (0.1 μg/once daily) from postnatal day (PN) 1 to 10 or from PN11 to 20. Controls were injected with methanol–saline. Body mass, food intake, neuropeptides, dopamine pathway parameters, anxiety-like behavior and locomotor activity were analyzed. The dopamine pathway was analyzed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAc) and dorsal striatum (DS) at PN180. PN1–10 BRO-treated animals had normal body mass and adiposity but lower food intake and plasma prolactin (PRL). This group had higher POMC in the arcuate nucleus (ARC), higher tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the VTA, higher dopa decarboxylase (DDc), higher D2R and μu-opioid receptor in the NAc. Concerning behavior in elevated plus maze (EPM), BRO-treated animals displayed more anxiety-like behaviors. PN11–20 BRO-treated showed normal body mass and adiposity but higher food intake and plasma PRL. This group had lower POMC in the ARC, lower TH in the VTA and lower DAT in the NAc. BRO-treated animals showed less anxiety-like behaviors in the EPM. Thus, neonatal BRO injection, depending on the time of treatment, leads to different long-term dysfunctions in the dopaminergic reward system, food intake behavior and anxiety levels, findings that could be partially due to PRL and POMC changes.

AB  - Abstract
Brain tauopathies are characterized by abnormal processing of tau protein. While somatodendritic tau mislocalization has attracted considerable attention in tauopathies, the role of tau pathology in axonal transport, connectivity and related dysfunctions remains obscure. We have previously shown using the squid giant synapse that presynaptic microinjection of recombinant human tau protein (htau42) results in failure of synaptic transmission. Here, we evaluated molecular mechanisms mediating this effect. Thus, the initial event, observed after htau42 presynaptic injection, was an increase in transmitter release. This event was mediated by calcium release from intracellular stores and was followed by a reduction in evoked transmitter release. The effect of htau42 on synaptic transmission was recapitulated by a peptide comprising the phosphatase-activating domain of tau, suggesting activation of phosphotransferases. Accordingly, findings indicated that htau42-mediated toxicity involves the activities of both GSK3 and Cdk5 kinases.

AB  - Abstract
Recently, more and more studies support that inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Although TGFβ signaling is involved in epileptogenesis, whether TGFβ-associated neuroinflammation is sufficient to regulate epilepsy remains unknown to date. Furthermore, tumor necrosis factor-α receptor-associated factor-6 (TRAF6), transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), which are the key elements of TGFβ-associated inflammation, is still unclear in epilepsy. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore the role of TRAF6 and TAK1 in pilocarpine-induced epileptic rat model. Firstly, the gene levels and protein expression of TRAF6 and TAK1 were detected in different time points after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). 5z-7-oxozeaenol treatment (TAK1 antagonist) was then performed; the changes in TRAF6, TAK1, phosphorylated-TAK1 (P-TAK1), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels, neuronal survival and apoptosis, and seizure activity were detected. Our results showed that expressions of TRAF6 were increased after SE, reached the peak in 7 day, maintained at the high level to 30 days, and the TAK1, P-TAK1 levels were increased after SE following time. After 5z-7-oxozeaenol treatment in epileptic rats, TRAF6–TAK1–P-TAK1 signaling protein expressions were reduced, inflammatory cytokine IL-1β expression was decreased, neuron survival index was improved, the neuron apoptosis index was decreased and seizure durations were alleviated. In conclusion, the expression of TRAF6 and TAK1 are related to the progression of epilepsy. TAK1 might be a potential intervention target for the treatment of epilepsy via neuroprotection.

AB  - Abstract
Neural activity during early development is known to alter innervation pathways in the central and peripheral nervous systems. We sought to examine how reduced sound-induced sensory activity in the cochlea affected the consolidation of glutamatergic synapses between inner hair cells (IHC) and the primary auditory neurons as these synapses play a primary role in transmitting sound information to the brain. A unilateral conductive hearing loss was induced prior to the onset of sound-mediated stimulation of the sensory hair cells, by rupturing the tympanic membrane and dislocating the auditory ossicles in the left ear of P11 mice. Auditory brainstem responses at P15 and P21 showed a 40–50-dB increase in thresholds for frequencies 8–32 kHz in the dislocated ear relative to the control ear. Immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were subsequently used to examine the effect of this attenuation of sound stimulation on the expression of RIBEYE, which comprises the presynaptic ribbons, Shank-1, a postsynaptic scaffolding protein, and the GluA2/3 and 4 subunits of postsynaptic AMPA receptors. Our results show that dislocation did not alter the number of pre- or postsynaptic protein puncta. However, dislocation did increase the size of RIBEYE, GluA4, GluA2/3 and Shank-1 puncta, with postsynaptic changes preceding presynaptic changes. Our data suggest that a reduction in sound stimulation during auditory development induces plasticity in the molecular make-up of IHC glutamatergic synapses, but does not affect the number of these synapses. Up-regulation of synaptic proteins with sound attenuation may facilitate a compensatory increase in synaptic transmission due to the reduced sensory stimulation of the IHC.

AB  - Abstract
Anesthesia profoundly impacts peri-infarct depolarizations (PIDs), but only one prior report has described their monitoring during experimental stroke in awake animals. Since temporal patterns of PID occurrence are model specific, the current study examined PID incidence during focal ischemia in the awake Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat (SHR), and documented the impact of both prior and concurrent isoflurane anesthesia. For awake recordings, electrodes were implanted under isoflurane anesthesia 1 day to 5 weeks prior to occlusion surgery. Rats were then subjected to permanent or transient (2 h) tandem occlusion of the middle cerebral and ipsilateral common carotid arteries, followed by PID monitoring for up to 3 days. Comparison perfusion imaging studies evaluated PID-associated hyperemic transients during permanent ischemia under anesthesia at varied intervals following prior isoflurane exposure. Prior anesthesia attenuated PID number at intervals up to 1 week, establishing 2 weeks as a practical recovery duration following surgical preparation to avoid isoflurane preconditioning effects. PIDs in awake SHR were limited to the first 4 h after permanent occlusions. Maintaining anesthesia during this interval reduced PID number, and prolonged their occurrence through several hours following anesthesia termination. Although PID number otherwise correlated with infarct size, PID suppression by anesthesia was not protective in the absence of reperfusion. PIDs persisted up to 36 h after transient occlusions. These results differ markedly from the one previous report of such monitoring in awake Sprague–Dawley rats, which found an extended biphasic PID time course during 24 h after both permanent and transient filament occlusions. PID occurrence closely reflects the time course of infarct progression in the respective models, and may be more useful than absolute PID number as an index of ongoing pathology.

AB  - Abstract
Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a pivotal role in higher order processing of cognition, attention and emotion. The network oscillation is considered an essential means for integration of these CNS functions. The oscillation power and coherence among related areas are often dis-regulated in several psychiatric and pathological conditions with a hemispheric asymmetric manner. Here we describe the network-based activity of field potentials recorded from the superficial layer of the mouse ACC in vitro using submerged type recordings. A short activation by kainic acid administration to the preparation induced populational activities ranging over several frequency bands including theta (3–8 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), beta (13–30 Hz), low gamma (30–50 Hz) and high gamma (50–80 Hz). These responses were repeatable and totally abolished by tetrodotoxin, and greatly diminished by inhibitors of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, GABAA receptor or gap-junctions. These observations suggest that the kainate-induced network activity can be a useful model of the network oscillation in the ACC circuit.

AB  - Abstract
Increasing evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRs) play a significant role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). MiR-133b, which is significantly decreased in the PD midbrain, has recently been shown to promote neurite outgrowth and enhance neural functional recovery. However, the role of miR-133b in PD has not been clearly established. Here, using a well-established PD model culture based on the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-pyridinium (MPP+), we demonstrated that miR-133b could promote axon outgrowth in dopaminergic neurons (DNs) and ameliorated MPP+-induced axon degeneration. Additional experiments suggested that the mechanisms of this miR-133b-mediated effect might rely on RhoA inhibition. We demonstrated that RhoA, an inhibitor of axonal growth, was increased in DNs under MPP+ treatment, and this increase could be attenuated by miR-133b overexpression. Moreover, we demonstrated that the induced expression of miR-133b could inhibit α-synuclein, which is critically involved in the pathological process of PD. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of miR-133b abrogated the MPP+-induced decrease in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio and upregulated phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), which is a pro-survival kinase. Together these findings reveal novel roles for miR-133b in the pathogenesis of PD and provide new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of the disease.

AB  - Abstract
The expression of β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is increased in the brain of late-onset sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and oxidative stress may be the potential cause of this event. The phenolic glucoside gastrodin (Gas), a main component of a Chinese herbal medicine Gastrodia elata Blume, has been demonstrated to display antioxidant activity and suppresses BACE1 expression. However, the mechanisms by which Gas suppresses BACE1 expression are not clear. Morris water maze test was performed to assess the effect of Gas treatment on memory impairments in Tg2576 mice. The level of oxidative stress in the brain of Tg2576 mice was determined by measuring the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, catalase (CAT) activity, and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and ROS. In vivo and in vitro, we detected the expression levels of BACE1, pPKRThr446, PKR, pPERKThr981, PERK, peIF2αSer51, and eIF2α using western blot analysis. We found that Gas improved learning and memory abilities of Tg2576 transgenic mice and attenuated intracellular oxidative stress in hippocampi of Tg2576 mice. We discovered that the expression levels of BACE1, activated PKR (pPKRThr446) and activated eIF2α (peIF2αSer51) were elevated in the brains of Tg2576 mice and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, peptide PKR inhibitor (PRI) and Gas down-regulated BACE1 expression in Tg2576 mice and H2O2-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells by inhibiting activation of PKR and eIF2α. Gas alleviates memory deficits in mice and suppresses BACE1 expression by inhibiting the protein kinase/Eukaryotic initiation factor-2α (PKR/eIF2α) pathway. The research suggested that Gas may develop as an drug candidate in neurodegenerative diseases.

Neuronal cell apoptosis is an important pathological change in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is known to be a novel gaseous signaling molecule and a cytoprotectant in many diseases including AD. However, the molecular mechanism of the antiapoptosis activity of H(2)S in AD is not yet fully understood. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the inhibitory effects of H(2)S on Abeta (Aβ)-induced apoptosis and the molecular mechanisms underlying primary neuron cells. Our results showed that sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), a donor of H(2)S, significantly ameliorated Aβ-induced cell apoptosis. NaHS also reversed the Aβ-induced translocation of the phosphatase and tensin homologs deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) from the cytosol to the mitochondria. Furthermore, H(2)S increased the level of p-AKT/AKT significantly. Interestingly, the antiapoptosis effects of H(2)S were blocked down by specific PI3K/AKT inhibitor wortmannin. In conclusion, these data indicate that H(2)S inhibits Aβ-induced neuronal apoptosis by attenuating mitochondrial translocation of PTEN and that activation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway plays a critical role in H(2)S-mediated neuronal protection. Our findings provide a novel route into the molecular mechanisms of neuronal apoptosis in AD.

AB  - Abstract
Alzheimer’s Disease is the leading neurodegenerative cause of dementia. The pathogenesis is not clearly understood yet, is believed to be the complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Consequently vascular risk factors and Apolipoprotein E genotyping are increasingly gaining importance.

This study aimed at assessing the relationships between Alzheimer’s Disease and Apolipoprotein E phenotype and vascular risk factors. Patients diagnosed with “possible Alzheimer’s Disease” in the Gazi University, Department of Neurology, were included in the study and age-matched volunteer patients who attended the polyclinic were included as a control group. In this study, the risk factors including low education level, smoking, hyperlipidemia, higher serum total cholesterol levels, and hyperhomocysteinemia were found to be statistically significantly more common in the Alzheimer’s Disease group in comparison to the Control Group, while all Apolipoprotein E ε4/ε4 genotypes were found in the Alzheimer’s Disease group.

The presence of the Apolipoprotein E ε4 allele is believed to increase vascular risk factors as well as to affect Alzheimer’s Disease directly. The biological indicators which are used in identifying the patients’ genes will be probably used in the treatment plan of the patients in the future.

AB  - Abstract
Huntington’s Disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by a polyglutamine expansion in the huntingtin protein. The YAC128 mouse model of HD expresses the full-length human huntingtin protein with 128 CAG repeats and replicates the phenotype and neurodegeneration that occur in HD. Several studies have implicated a role for neuroinflammation in HD pathogenesis. Studies on presymptomatic HD patients have illustrated microgliosis (activated microglia) in brain regions affected in HD. Mutant huntingtin expressing isolated primary monocytes (human HD patients) and primary macrophages (YAC128) are overactive in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. In this study we demonstrate that cultured primary microglia (the resident immune cells of the brain cells) from YAC128 mice differentially express a wide number of cytokines compared to wildtype microglia cultures in response to LPS. Furthermore, this study outlines a direct interaction between mutant huntingtin and cytokine secretion in HD microglia. Increased cytokine release in YAC128 microglia can be blocked by cannabinoid activation or by mutant huntingtin knockdown with anti-sense oligonucleotide treatment. Matrix metalloprotease 3 (MMP3), an endogenous neuronal activator of microglia, also induces increased cytokine release from YAC128 microglia compared to wildtype microglia. We found elevated MMP levels in HD CSF, and MMP levels correlate with disease severity in HD. These data support a novel role for MMPs and microglial activation in HD pathogenesis. With an improved understanding of the specific cellular processes involved in HD neuroinflammation, novel therapeutic agents targeting these processes can be developed and hold great promise in the treatment of HD.

AB  - Abstract
Vascular dysregulation has long been recognized as an important pathophysiological factor underlying the development of glaucomatous neuropathy. Endothelin-1 (ET1) has been shown to be a key player due to its potent vasoconstrictive properties that result in retinal ischemia and oxidative stress leading to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) apoptosis and optic nerve (ON) damage. In this study we investigated the protective effects of magnesium acetyltaurate (MgAT) against retinal cell apoptosis and ON damage. MgAT was administered intravitreally prior to, along with or after administration of ET1. Seven days post-injection, animals were euthanized and retinae were subjected to morphometric analysis, TUNEL and caspase-3 staining. ON sections were stained with toluidine blue and were graded for neurodegenerative effects. Oxidative stress was also estimated in isolated retinae. Pre-treatment with MgAT significantly lowered ET1-induced retinal cell apoptosis as measured by retinal morphometry and TUNEL staining. This group of animals also showed significantly lesser caspase-3 activation and significantly reduced retinal oxidative stress compared to the animals that received intravitreal injection of only ET1. Additionally, the axonal degeneration in ON was markedly reduced in MgAT pretreated animals. The animals that received MgAT co- or post-treatment with ET1 also showed improvement in all parameters; however, the effects were not as significant as observed in MgAT pretreated animals. The current study showed that the intravitreal pre-treatment with MgAT reduces caspase-3 activation and prevents retinal cell apoptosis and axon loss in ON induced by ET1. This protective effect of ET1 was associated with reduced retinal oxidative stress.

AB  - Abstract
Pediatric cardiac arrest (CA) often leads to poor neurologic outcomes, including deficits in learning and memory. The only approved treatment for CA is therapeutic hypothermia, although its utility in the pediatric population remains unclear. This study analyzed the effect of mild therapeutic hypothermia after CA in juvenile mice on hippocampal neuronal injury and the cellular model of learning and memory, termed long-term potentiation (LTP). Juvenile mice were subjected to cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR) followed by normothermia (37 °C) and hypothermia (30 °C, 32 °C). Histological injury of hippocampal CA1 neurons was performed 3 days after resuscitation using hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining. Field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded from acute hippocampal slices 7 days after CA/CPR to determine LTP. Synaptic function was impaired 7 days after CA/CPR. Mice exposed to hypothermia showed equivalent neuroprotection, but exhibited sexually dimorphic protection against ischemia-induced impairment of LTP. Hypothermia (32 °C) protects synaptic plasticity more effectively in females, with males requiring a deeper level of hypothermia (30 °C) for equivalent protection. In conclusion, male and female juvenile mice exhibit equivalent neuronal injury following CA/CPR and hypothermia protects both males and females. We made the surprising finding that juvenile mice have a sexually dimorphic response to mild therapeutic hypothermia protection of synaptic function, where males may need a deeper level of hypothermia for equivalent synaptic protection.

AB  - Abstract
Mice with a constitutive or tamoxifen-induced Cre recombinase (Cre) expression are frequently used research tools to allow the conditional deletion of target genes via the Cre-loxP system. Here we analyzed for the first time in a comprehensive and comparative way, whether retinal Cre expression or topical tamoxifen treatment itself would cause structural or functional changes, including changes in the expression profiles of molecular markers, glial reactivity and photoreceptor vulnerability. To this end, we characterized the transgenic α-Cre, Lmop-Cre and the tamoxifen-inducible CAGG-CreER™ mouse lines, all having robust Cre expression in the neuronal retina. In addition, we characterized the effects of topical tamoxifen treatment itself in wildtype mice. We performed morphometric analyses, immunohistochemical staining, in vivo ERG and angiography analyses and realtime RT-PCR analyses. Furthermore, the influence of Cre recombinase or topical tamoxifen exposure on neuronal vulnerability was studied by using light damage as a model for photoreceptor degeneration. Taken together, neither the expression of Cre, nor topical tamoxifen treatment caused detectable changes in retinal structure and function, the expression profiles of investigated molecular markers, glial reactivity and photoreceptor vulnerability. We conclude that the Cre-loxP system and its induction through tamoxifen is a safe and reliable method to delete desired target genes in the neural retina.

AB  - Abstract
The vertebrate blood–brain barrier (BBB) creates an obstacle for central nervous system-related drug delivery. Claudin-5 (Cldn5), expressed in large quantities in BBB, plays a vital role in restricting BBB permeability. The C-terminal domain of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (cCPE) has been verified as binding to a subset of claudins (Cldns). The Cldn5-binding cCPE194–319 variant cCPEY306W/S313H was applied in this study to investigate its ability to modulate the permeability of zebrafish larval BBB. In vitro results showed that cCPEY306W/S313H is able to bind specifically to Cldn5 in murine brain vascular endothelial (bEnd.3) cells, and is transported along with Cldn5 from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm, which in turn results in a reduction in transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER). Conversely, this effect can be reversed by removal of cCPEY306W/S313H. In an in vivo experiment, this study estimates the capability of cCPEY306W/S313H to modulate Cldn5 using a rhodamine B-Dextran dye diffusion assay in zebrafish larval BBB. The results show that cCPEY306W/S313H co-localized with Cldn5 in zebrafish cerebral vascular cells and modulated BBB permeability, resulting in dye leakage. Taken together, this study suggests that cCPEY306W/S313H has the capability – both in vitro and in vivo – to modulate BBB permeability temporarily by specific binding to Cldn5.

AB  - Abstract
Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common type of epilepsy in humans. The lithium-pilocarpine model in rodents reproduces some of the main features of human TLE. Three-week-old Wistar rats were used in this study. The changes in AMPA receptor subunit composition were investigated in several brain areas, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the temporal cortex (TC), and the dorsal (DH) and ventral hippocampus (VH) during the first week following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (PILO-induced SE). In the hippocampus, GluA1 and GluA2 mRNA expression slightly decreased after PILO-induced SE and returned to the initial level on the seventh day. We did not detect any significant changes in mRNA expression of the GluA1 and GluA2 subunits in the TC, whereas in the mPFC we observed a significant increase of GluA1 mRNA expression on the third day and a decrease in GluA2 mRNA expression during the entire first week. Accordingly, the GluA1/GluA2 expression ratio increased in the mPFC, and the functional properties of the pyramidal cell excitatory synapses were disturbed. Using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, we found that on the third day following PILO-induced SE, isolated mPFC pyramidal neurons showed an inwardly rectifying current–voltage relation of kainate-evoked currents, suggesting the presence of GluA2-lacking calcium-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs). IEM-1460, a selective antagonist of CP-AMPARs, significantly reduced the amplitude of evoked EPSC in pyramidal neurons from mPFC slices on the first and third days, but not on the seventh day. The antagonist had no effects on EPSC amplitude in slices from control animals. Thus, our data demonstrate that PILO-induced SE affects subunit composition of AMPARs in different brain areas, including the mPFC. SE induces transient (up to few days) incorporation of CP-AMPARs in the excitatory synapses of mPFC pyramidal neurons, which may disrupt normal circuitry functions.

AB  - Abstract
To better understand the effects of deafness on the brain, these experiments examine how disrupted balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission following the loss of excitatory input from the auditory nerve alters the central auditory system. In the avian cochlear nucleus, nucleus magnocellularis (NM), deprivation of excitatory input induced by deafness triggers neuronal death. While this neuronal death was previously accredited to the loss of excitatory drive, the present experiments examine an alternative hypothesis: that inhibitory input to NM, which may also be affected by deafness, contributes to neuronal death in NM. Using an in vitro slice preparation in which excitatory input from the auditory nerve is absent, we pharmacologically altered GABA receptor activation in NM, and assayed an early marker of neuronal health, antigenicity for the ribosomal antibody Y10B (Y10B-ir). We found that GABA decreases Y10B-ir, and that GABAA activation is necessary for the GABA-induced effect. We further found that endogenous GABAA activation similarly decreases Y10B-ir and this decrease requires extracellular Ca2+. Our results suggest that, in the absence of excitatory input, endogenous activation of ionotropic GABAA receptors is detrimental to NM neurons.

AB  - Abstract
Astronauts’ training is conventionally performed in a pool to reproduce weightlessness by exploiting buoyancy which is supposed to reduce the impact of gravity on the body. However, this training method has not been scientifically validated yet, and requires first to study the effects of underwater exposure on motor behavior. We examined the influence of neutral buoyancy on kinematic features of whole-body reaching underwater and compared them with those produced on land. Eight professional divers were asked to perform arm reaching movements toward visual targets while standing. Targets were presented either close or far from the subjects (requiring in the latter case an additional whole-body displacement). Reaching movements were performed on land or underwater in two different contexts of buoyancy. The divers either wore a diving suit only with neutral buoyancy applied to their center of mass or were additionally equipped with a submersible simulated space suit with neutral buoyancy applied to their body limbs. Results showed that underwater exposure impacted basic movement features, especially movement speed which was reduced. However, movement kinematics also differed according to the way buoyancy was exerted on the whole-body. When neutral buoyancy was applied to the center of mass only, some focal and postural components of whole-body reaching remained close to land observations, notably when considering the relative deceleration duration of arm elevation and concomitant forward trunk bending when reaching the far target. On the contrary, when neutral buoyancy was exerted on body segments, movement kinematics were close to those reported in weightlessness, as reflected by the arm deceleration phase and the whole-body forward displacement when reaching the far target. These results suggest that astronauts could benefit from the application of neutral buoyancy across the whole-body segments to optimize underwater training and acquire specific motor skills which will be used in space.

AB  - Abstract
Tamoxifen (TAM), a selective estrogen receptor modulator, has frequently been used in the treatment of breast cancer. In view of the fact that cognitive deficits in women who receive adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer is a common health problem, using female animal models for investigating the cognitive effects of TAM administration may improve our knowledge of TAM therapy. Therefore, the present study assessed the role of dorsal hippocampal cholinergic nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) in the effect of TAM administration on memory retrieval in ovariectomized (OVX) and non-OVX female rats using a passive avoidance learning task. Our results showed that pre-test administration of TAM (2–6 mg/kg) impaired memory retrieval. Pre-test intra-CA1 microinjection of nicotine (0.3–0.5 μg/rat) reversed TAM-induced memory impairment. Pre-test intra-CA1 microinjection of mecamylamine (0.1–0.3 μg/rat) plus 2 mg/kg (an ineffective dose) of TAM impaired memory retrieval. Pre-test intra-CA1 microinjection of the same doses of nicotine and mecamylamine by themselves had no effect on memory retrieval. In OVX rats, the administration of TAM (6 mg/kg) produced memory impairment but pre-test intra-CA1 microinjection of nicotine (0.5 μg/rat) had no effect on TAM response. Moreover, the administration of an ineffective dose of TAM (2 mg/kg) had no effect on memory retrieval in OVX rats, while pre-test intra-CA1 microinjection of mecamylamine (0.3 μg/rat) impaired memory retrieval. Taken together, it can be concluded that the impairing effect of TAM on memory formation may be modulated by nAChRs of the CA1 regions. It seems that memory impairment may be considered as an important side effect of TAM.

AB  - Abstract
The arcuate nucleus (ARC) plays an important role in the hypothalamic control of energy homeostasis. Expression of various purinoceptor subtypes in the rat ARC and physiological studies suggest a modulatory function of P2 receptors within the neuroglial ARC circuitry. A differentiated mixed neuronal and glial microculture was therefore established from postnatal rat ARC, revealing neuronal expression of ARC-specific transmitters involved in food intake regulation (neuropeptide Y (NPY), proopiomelanocortin (POMC), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)). Some NPYergic neurons cosynthesized TH, while POMC and TH expression proved to be mutually exclusive. Stimulation with the general purinoceptor agonists 2-methylthioadenosine-5′triphosphate (2-MeSATP) and ATP but not the P2X1/P2X3 receptor subtype agonist α,β-methyleneadenosine-5′triphosphate (α,β-meATP) induced intracellular calcium signals in ARC neurons and astrocytes. Some 5–10% each of 2-MeSATP responsive neurons expressed POMC, NYP or TH. Supporting the calcium imaging data, radioligand binding studies to hypothalamic membranes showed high affinity for 2-MeSATP, ATP but not α,β-meATP to displace [α-35S]deoxyadenosine-5′thiotriphosphate ([35S]dATPαS) from P2 receptors. Repetitive superfusion with equimolar 2-MeSATP allowed categorization of ARC cells into groups with a high or low (LDD) degree of purinoceptor desensitization, the latter allowing further receptor characterization. Calcium imaging experiments performed at 37 °C vs. room temperature showed further reduction of desensitization. Agonist-mediated intracellular calcium signals were suppressed in all LDD neurons but only 25% of astrocytes in the absence of extracellular calcium, suggestive of metabotropic P2Y receptor expression in the majority of ARC astrocytes. The highly P2Y1-selective receptor agonists MRS2365 and 2-methylthioadenosine-5′diphosphate (2-MeSADP) activated 75–85% of all 2-MeSATP-responsive ARC astrocytes. Taking into consideration the high potency to dose-dependently stimulate ARC cells of the LDD group, the high affinity for rat P2X(1–3) and low affinity for rat P2X4, P2X7 and P2Y receptor subtypes except P2Y1 and P2Y13, the agonist 2-MeSATP primarily acted upon P2X2 and P2Y1 purinoceptors to trigger intracellular calcium signaling in ARC neurons and astrocytes.

AB  - Abstract
Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract in ataxin-1 (ATXN1). The pathological hallmarks of SCA1 are the loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells and neurons in the brainstem and the presence of nuclear aggregates containing the polyQ-expanded ATXN1 protein. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors have been shown to reduce polyQ-induced toxicity. This study was designed to examine the therapeutic effects of BIIB021, a purine-scaffold Hsp90 inhibitor, on the protein homeostasis of polyQ-expanded mutant ATXN1 in a cell culture model of SCA1. Our results demonstrated that BIIB021 activated heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and suppressed the abnormal accumulation of ATXN1 and its toxicity. The pharmacological degradation of mutant ATXN1 via activated HSF1 was dependent on both the proteasome and autophagy systems. These findings indicate that HSF1 is a key molecule in the regulation of the protein homeostasis of the polyQ-expanded mutant ATXN1 and that Hsp90 has potential as a novel therapeutic target in patients with SCA1.

Previous neuroimaging studies provide evidence for the involvement of the anterior insulae (INSs) in perceptual decision-making processes. However, how the insular cortex is involved in integration of degraded sensory information to create a conscious percept of environment and to drive our behaviors still remains a mystery. In this study, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and four different perceptual categorization tasks in visual and audio-visual domains, we measured blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals and examined the roles of INSs in easy and difficult perceptual decision-making. We created a varying degree of degraded stimuli by manipulating the task-specific stimuli in these four experiments to examine the effects of task difficulty on insular cortex response. We hypothesized that significantly higher BOLD response would be associated with the ambiguity of the sensory information and decision-making difficulty. In all of our experimental tasks, we found the INS activity consistently increased with task difficulty and participants’ behavioral performance changed with the ambiguity of the presented sensory information. These findings support the hypothesis that the anterior insulae are involved in sensory-guided, goal-directed behaviors and their activities can predict perceptual load and task difficulty.

Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the only approved therapy for acute ischemic stroke, but tPA therapy is limited by a short therapeutic window and some adverse side effects. 2-(4-Methoxyphenyl)ethyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-pyranoside, a salidroside analog (code-named SalA-4g), has shown potent neuroprotective effects. In this study, a rat model of embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was used to mimic ischemic stroke. The embolic MCAO rats were intravenously (iv) injected with tPA alone, SalA-4g alone, or a combination of tPA and SalA-4g. Compared to treatment with tPA alone at 4 h post MCAO, combined treatment with tPA at 4 h post MCAO and SalA-4g starting at 4 h post MCAO and continuing for 3 days at an interval of 24 h significantly reduced neurological deficits and infarct volume, and significantly inhibited the intracerebral bleeding, edema formation, neuronal loss, and cellular apoptosis in the ischemic brain. Our results suggested that additive neuroprotective actions of SalA-4g contributed to widening the therapeutic window of tPA therapy and ameliorating its side effects in treating MCAO rats. The therapeutic benefits of combined treatment with tPA and SalA-4g for ischemic stroke might be associated with its effects on cerebral glucose metabolism.

AB  - Abstract
Excess glutamate release from the presynaptic membrane has been thought to be the major cause of ischemic neuronal death. Although both CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons receive presynaptic glutamate input, transient cerebral ischemia induces CA1 neurons to die while CA3 neurons remain relatively intact. This suggests that changes in the properties of pyramidal cells may be the main cause related to ischemic neuronal death. Our previous studies have shown that the densities of dendritic spines and asymmetric synapses in the CA1 area are increased at 12 h and 24 h after ischemia. In the present study, we investigated changes in synaptic structures in the CA3 area and compared the expression of glutamate receptors in the CA1 and CA3 hippocampal regions of rats after ischemia. Our results demonstrated that the NR2B/NR2A ratio became larger after ischemia although the expression of both the NR2B subunit (activation of apoptotic pathway) and NR2A subunit (activation of survival pathway) decreased in the CA1 area from 6 h to 48 h after reperfusion. Furthermore, expression of the GluR2 subunit (calcium impermeable) of the AMPA receptor class significantly decreased while the GluR1 subunit (calcium permeable) remained unchanged at the same examined reperfusion times, which subsequently caused an increase in the GluR1/GluR2 ratio. Despite these notable differences in subunit expression, there were no obvious changes in the density of synapses or expression of NMDAR and AMPAR subunits in the CA3 area after ischemia. These results suggest that delayed CA1 neuronal death may be related to the dramatic fluctuation in the synaptic structure and relative upregulation of NR2B and GluR1 subunits induced by transient global ischemia.

AB  - Abstract
Women are more likely to develop depression during childbearing years with up to 20% of women suffering from depression during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. Increased prevalence of depression during the perinatal period has resulted in frequent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant treatment; however the effects of such medications on the maternal brain remain limited. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of the SSRI medication, fluoxetine, on neurobiological differences in the maternal brain. To model aspects of maternal depression, gestational stress was used. Sprague–Dawley rat dams were exposed to either gestational stress and/or fluoxetine (5 mg/kg/day) to form the following four groups: 1. Control + Vehicle, 2. Stress + Vehicle, 3. Control + Fluoxetine, and 4. Stress + Fluoxetine. At weaning maternal brains were collected. Main findings show that gestational stress alone increased synaptophysin and serotonin metabolism in the cingulate cortex2 region of the cortex while fluoxetine treatment after stress normalized these effects. In the hippocampus, fluoxetine treatment, regardless of gestational stress exposure, decreased both global measures of methylation in the dentate gyrus, as measured by Dnmt3a immunoreactivity, as well as serotonin metabolism. No further changes in synaptophysin, PSD-95, or Dnmt3a immunoreactivity were seen in the cortical or hippocampal areas investigated. These findings show that gestational stress and SSRI medication affect the neurobiology of the maternal brain in a region-specific manner. This work adds to a much needed area of research aimed at understanding neurobiological changes associated with maternal depression and the role of SSRI treatment in altering these changes in the female brain.

AB  - Abstract
The spinal dorsal horn processes somatosensory information before conveying it to the brain. The neuronal organization of the dorsal horn is still poorly understood, although recent studies have defined several distinct populations among the interneurons, which account for most of its constituent neurons. All primary afferents, and the great majority of neurons in laminae I–III are glutamatergic, and a major factor limiting our understanding of the synaptic circuitry has been the difficulty in identifying glutamatergic synapses with light microscopy. Although there are numerous potential targets for antibodies, these are difficult to visualize with immunocytochemistry, because of protein cross-linking following tissue fixation. Although this can be overcome by antigen retrieval methods, these lead to difficulty in detecting other antigens. The aim of this study was to test whether the postsynaptic protein Homer can be used to reveal glutamatergic synapses in the dorsal horn. Immunostaining for Homer gave punctate labeling when viewed by confocal microscopy, and this was restricted to synapses at the ultrastructural level. We found that Homer puncta were colocalized with the AMPA receptor GluR2 subunit, but not with the inhibitory synapse-associated protein gephyrin. We also examined several populations of glutamatergic axons and found that most boutons were in contact with at least one Homer punctum. These results suggest that Homer antibodies can be used to reveal the great majority of glutamatergic synapses without antigen retrieval. This will be of considerable value in tracing synaptic circuits, and also in investigating plasticity of glutamatergic synapses in pain states.

AB  - Abstract
SLC26A4 mutations cause fluctuating and progressive hearing loss associated with enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct (EVA). SLC26A4 encodes a transmembrane anion exchanger called pendrin expressed in nonsensory epithelial cells of the lateral wall of cochlea, vestibular organs and endolymphatic sac. We previously described a transgenic mouse model of EVA with doxycycline (dox)-inducible expression of Slc26a4 in which administration of dox from conception to embryonic day 17.5 (DE17.5) resulted in hearing fluctuation between 1 and 3 months of age. In the present study, we hypothesized that Slc26a4 is required to stabilize hearing in DE17.5 ears between 1 and 3 months of age. We tested our hypothesis by evaluating the effect of postnatal re-induction of Slc26a4 expression on hearing. Readministration of dox to DE17.5 mice at postnatal day 6 (P6), but not at 1 month of age, resulted in reduced click-evoked auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds, less fluctuation of hearing and a higher surface density of pendrin expression in spindle-shaped cells of the stria vascularis. Pendrin expression in spindle-shaped cells was inversely correlated with ABR thresholds. These findings suggest that stabilization of hearing by readministration of dox at P6 is mediated by pendrin expression in spindle-shaped cells. We conclude that early re-induction of Slc26a4 expression can prevent fluctuation of hearing in our Slc26a4-insufficient mouse model. Restoration of SLC26A4 expression and function could reduce or prevent fluctuation of hearing in EVA patients.

AB  - Abstract
The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a nucleus defined as part of the extended amygdala, is involved in the expression of anxiety disorders. However, the regulatory mechanisms of BNST inhibitory activity that is involved in anxiety are unknown. Here, we showed that blocking neuregulin 1 (NRG1)-ErbB4 signaling in the BNST of mice, by either neutralizing endogenous NRG1 with ecto-Erbb4 or antagonizing the ErbB4 receptor with its specific inhibitor, produced anxiogenic responses. Interestingly, application of exogenous NRG1 into the BNST induced no anxiolytic effects, suggesting saturating activity of endogenous NRG1. While infusion of the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline into the BNST also led to anxiety-related behaviors, it did not worsen the anxiogenic effects produced by blocking NRG1-ErbB4 signaling, suggesting possible involvement of GABAergic neurotransmission. Further, in vitro electrophysiological recordings showed that BNST NRG1-ErbB4 signaling regulated the presynaptic GABA release. Together, these results suggest that NRG1-ErbB4 signaling in the BNST may play an important role in regulating anxiety-like behaviors.

AB  - Abstract
Age-associated changes in cognition are mirrored by impairments in cellular models of memory and learning, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). In young rodents, environmental enrichment (EE) can enhance memory, alter LTP and LTD, as well as reverse cognitive deficits induced by aging. Whether short-term EE can benefit cognition and synaptic plasticity in aged rodents is unclear. Here, we tested if short-term EE could overcome age-associated impairments in induction of LTP and LTD. LTP and LTD could not be induced in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices in control, aged rats using standard stimuli that are highly effective in young rats. However, exposure of aged littermates to EE for three weeks enabled successful induction of LTP and LTD. EE-facilitated LTP was dependent upon N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). These alterations in synaptic plasticity occurred with elevated levels of phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein and vascular endothelial growth factor, but in the absence of changes in several other synaptic and cellular markers. Importantly, our study suggests that even a relatively short period of EE is sufficient to alter synaptic plasticity and molecular markers linked to cognitive function in aged animals.

AB  - Abstract
Amphetamine withdrawal (AW) is accompanied by diminished pleasure and depression which plays a key role in drug relapse and addictive behaviors. There is no efficient treatment for AW-induced depression and underpinning mechanisms were not well determined. Considering both transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 1 (TRPV1) and N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors contribute to pathophysiology of mood and addictive disorders, in this study, we investigated the role of TRPV1 and NMDA receptors in mediating depressive-like behaviors following AW in male mice. Results revealed that administration of capsaicin, TRPV1 agonist, (100 μg/mouse, i.c.v.) and MK-801, NMDA receptor antagonist (0.005 mg/kg, i.p.) reversed AW-induced depressive-like behaviors in forced swimming test (FST) and splash test with no effect on animals’ locomotion. Co-administration of sub-effective doses of MK-801 (0.001 mg/kg, i.p.) and capsaicin (10 μg/mouse, i.c.v) exerted antidepressant-like effects in behavioral tests. Capsazepine, TRPV1 antagonist, (100 μg/mouse, i.c.v) and NMDA, NMDA receptor agonist (7.5 mg/kg, i.p.) abolished the effects of capsaicin and MK-801, respectively. None of aforementioned treatments had any effect on behavior of control animals. Collectively, our findings showed that activation of TRPV1 and blockade of NMDA receptors produced antidepressant-like effects in male mice following AW, and these receptors are involved in AW-induced depressive-like behaviors. Further, we found that rapid antidepressant-like effects of capsaicin in FST and splash test are partly mediated by NMDA receptors.

AB  - Abstract
Developmental exposure to arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands abolishes sex differences in a wide range of neural structures and functions. A well-studied example is the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV), a structure that controls sex-specific luteinizing hormone (LH) release. In the male, testosterone (T) secreted by the developing testes defeminizes LH release mechanisms; conversely, perinatal AhR activation by 2,3,7,8,-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) blocks defeminization. To better understand developmental mechanisms altered by TCDD exposure, we first verified that neonatal TCDD exposure in male rats prevented the loss of AVPV GABA/glutamate neurons that are critical for female-typical LH surge release. We then used whole genome arrays and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) to compare AVPV transcriptomes of males treated neonatally with TCDD or vehicle. Our bioinformatics analyses showed that TCDD enriched gene sets important for neuron development, synaptic transmission, ion homeostasis, and cholesterol biosynthesis. In addition, upstream regulatory analysis suggests that both estrogen receptors (ER) and androgen receptors (AR) regulate genes targeted by TCDD. Of the 23 mRNAs found to be changed by TCDD at least 2-fold (p &lt; 0.05), most participate in the functions identified in our bioinformatics analyses. Several, including matrix metallopeptidase 9 and SRY-box 11 (Sox11), are known targets of E2. CUG triplet repeat, RNA binding protein 2 (cugbp2) is particularly interesting because it is sex-specific, oppositely regulated by estradiol (E2) and TCDD. Moreover, it regulates the post-transcriptional processing of molecules previously linked to sexual differentiation of the brain. These findings provide new insights into how TCDD may interfere with defeminization of LH release patterns.

AB  - Abstract
Axonal loss contributes to induction of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, ameliorates neurological dysfunction in diabetic peripheral neuropathy. However, the direct effect of high glucose and sildenafil on axonal growth has not been extensively investigated. Using rat primary dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons cultured in a microfluidic chamber, we investigated the effect of axonal application of high glucose and sildenafil on distal axonal growth. We found that axonal, but not cell body, application of high glucose locally inhibited distal axonal growth. However, axonal application of sildenafil overcame high glucose-reduced axonal growth. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analysis of distal axonal samples revealed that high glucose reduced axonal miR-146a levels and substantially increased miR-146a target genes, IRAK1 and TRAF6 in the axon. In contrast, sildenafil significantly reversed high glucose-reduced miR-146a levels and high glucose-increased IRAK1 and TRAF6. Gain- and loss-of function of miR-146a in DRG neurons revealed that miR-146a mediated the local effect of high glucose on the distal axonal growth. These in vitro data provide new insights into molecular mechanisms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

AB  - Abstract
Clinical studies suggest a link between depression and dysfunctional tryptophan (TRP) metabolism. Even though depression is twice as prevalent in women as men, the impact of the estrous cycle on TRP metabolism is not well-understood. Here we investigated 13 kynurenine and serotonin metabolites in female Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rats, a genetic rat model of depression. FSL rats and controls (Flinders Resistant Line rats), 12–20 weeks old, were subject to the forced swim test (FST), a commonly used measure of depression-like behavior. Open field was used to evaluate locomotor ability and agoraphobia. Subsequently, plasma and hemispheres were collected and analyzed for their content of TRP metabolites using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Vaginal saline lavages were obtained daily for ⩾2 cycles. To estimate the effects of sex and FST we included plasma from unhandled, naïve male FSL and FRL rats. Female FSL rats showed a depression-like phenotype with increased immobility in the FST, not confounded by anxiety. In the brain, 3-hydroxykynurenine was increased whereas anthranilate and 5-hydroxytryptophan were decreased. In plasma, anthranilate and quinolinate levels were lower in FSL rats compared to the control line, independent of sex and FST. The estrous cycle neither impacted behavior nor TRP metabolite levels in the FSL rat. In conclusion, the female FSL rat is an interesting preclinical model of depression with altered TRP metabolism, independent of the estrous cycle. The status of the pathway in brain was not reflected in the plasma, which may indicate that an inherent local, cerebral regulation of TRP metabolism occurs.

AB  - Abstract
Intrinsic signal optical imaging has been widely used to measure functional maps in various sensory cortices due to better spatial resolution and sensitivity for detecting cortical neuroplasticity. However, application of this technique in dentistry has not been reported. In this study, intrinsic signal optical imaging was used to investigate mechanically driven responses in the cat somatosensory cortex, when punctate mechanical stimuli were applied to maxillary canines. The global signal and its spatial organization pattern were obtained. Global signal strength gradually increased with stimulus strength. There was no significant difference in response strength between contralateral and ipsilateral mechanical stimulation. A slightly greater response was recorded in the sigmoidal gyrus than in the coronal gyrus. The cat somatosensory cortex activated by sensory inputs from mechanical stimulation of canines lacks both topographical and functional organization. It is not organized into columns that represent sensory input from each tooth or direction of stimulation. These results demonstrate that intrinsic signal optical imaging is a valid tool for investigating neural responses and neuroplasticity in the somatosensory cortex that represents teeth.

AB  - Abstract
Thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) is the most effective drug treatment for acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 h after symptom onset. However, the use of rtPA may increase the risk of hemorrhagic transformation (HT), particularly when it is administered after the first 4.5 h. However, no effective treatments are available to reduce the HT risk. Disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is central to the genesis of HT. Connexin43 (Cx43)-mediated gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) has been demonstrated to regulate the integrity of the BBB in ischemia. We investigated the effect of Cx43 on BBB permeability during rtPA-induced HT. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) underwent a 1.5-h middle cerebral artery occlusion and were treated with rtPA at 4.5 h. The rats were sacrificed at 24 h, and their brains were evaluated for BBB permeability and the expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins and Cx43. We examined whether the effects were Cx43 dependent using multiple Cx43 inhibitors. Phosphorylated Cx43 (p-Cx43) but not total Cx43 protein expression was increased after rtPA treatment. Delayed rtPA administration induced significant HT and BBB disruption. These effects were attenuated by inhibitors that blocked GJIC and Cx43 phosphorylation and expression but not Cx43 redistribution. Additionally, rtPA administration upregulated p-Cx43 expression in hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R)-exposed brain endothelial cells. These effects were suppressed by the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) inhibitor U0126. We suggest that rtPA-associated hemorrhage due to an alteration in the integrity of the BBB is highly associated with an increase in p-Cx43 resulting from the activation of the PI3K and ERK pathways.

AB  - Abstract
Hypothyroidism during early development leads to numerous morphological, biochemical and functional changes in developing brain. In this study, we investigated the effects of voluntary and treadmill exercise on learning, memory and hippocampal BDNF levels in both hypothyroid male and female rat pups. To induce hypothyroidism in the mothers, 6-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU) was added to their drinking water (100 mg/L) from their embryonic day 6 to their postnatal day (PND) 21. For 14 days, from PNDs 31 to 44, the rat pups were trained with one of the two different exercise protocols, namely the mild treadmill exercise and the voluntary wheel exercise. On PNDs 45–52, a water maze was used for testing their learning and memory ability. The rats were sacrificed one day later and their BDNF levels were then measured in the hippocampus. The findings of the present study indicate that hypothyroidism during the fetal period and the early postnatal period is associated with the impairment of spatial learning and memory and reduced hippocampal BDNF levels in both male and female rat offspring. Both the short-term treadmill exercise and the voluntary wheel exercise performed during the postnatal period reverse the behavioral and neurochemical deficits induced by developmental thyroid hormone insufficiency in both male and female rat offspring. The findings of this study thus demonstrate a marked reversibility of both behavioral and neurochemical disorders induced by developmental thyroid hormone insufficiency through the performance of exercise.

AB  - Abstract
The intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) is a flat retinorecipient thalamic structure implicated in orchestrating circadian rhythm, historically considered to be a subdivision of the neighboring ventrolateral geniculate nucleus (VLG). IGL consists of two main neuronal subpopulations: enkephalinergic and neuropeptide Y (NPY)-synthesizing cells. These cell types have different functions, connectivity and firing pattern in vivo, which suggest that they have different membrane currents to support their functional differences. We therefore performed patch-clamp experiments combined with immunohistochemical staining to clarify possible differences in the subthreshold currents of IGL neurons. Our results suggest that IGL neurons can be divided into two subpopulations based on two ionic currents. A T-type calcium current (IT) was identified in neurons that do not synthesise NPY, whereas all NPY-positive neurons were found to express a marked A-type potassium current (IA). Due to the fact that the clear electrophysiological discriminants between IGL and VLG are lacking, we decided to compare the amplitudes of the identified currents between those two structures. Our data suggest that VLG neurons can be characterized by a high amplitude IT and a low IA. Finally, we compared both currents with WAG/Rij rats, a well-established model of absence epilepsy, with co-occurring retinal pathologies, sleep-onset disturbances, and seizures exhibiting circadian rhythmicity. Data presented in this study uncovered pathologies in the IT exhibiting neurons of the IGL and VLG. In conclusion, the data presented here suggest that different subthreshold current expression supports the functional differences of thalamic nuclei. Those differences are promising for possible pharmacological manipulations of specified cell types in pathophysiologies including absence epilepsy.

AB  - Abstract
Inherited retinal degeneration such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is associated with photoreceptor loss and concomitant morphological and functional changes in the inner retina. It is not known whether these changes are associated with changes in the density and distribution of synaptic inputs to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). We quantified changes in ganglion cell density in rd1 and age-matched C57BL/6J-(wildtype, WT) mice using the immunocytochemical marker, RBPMS. Our data revealed that following complete loss of photoreceptors, (∼3 months of age), there was a reduction in ganglion cell density in the peripheral retina. We next examined changes in synaptic inputs to A type ganglion cells by performing double labeling experiments in mice with the ganglion cell reporter lines, rd1-Thy1 and age-matched wildtype-Thy1. Ribbon synapses were identified by co-labelling with CtBP2 (RIBEYE) and conventional synapses with the clustering molecule, gephyrin. ON RGCs showed a significant reduction in RIBEYE-immunoreactive synapse density while OFF RGCs showed a significant reduction in the gephyrin-immmunoreactive synapse density. Distribution patterns of both synaptic markers across the dendritic trees of RGCs were unchanged. The change in synaptic inputs to RGCs was associated with a reduction in the number of immunolabeled rod bipolar and ON cone bipolar cells. These results suggest that functional changes reported in ganglion cells during retinal degeneration could be attributed to loss of synaptic inputs.

AB  - Abstract
Kynurenine pathway metabolites (KPM) are thought to be synthesized mainly by non-neuronal cells in the mammalian brain. KPM are of particular interest because several studies demonstrated their implication in various disorders of the nervous system. Among KPM is xanthurenic acid (XA) deriving from the catabolism of 3-hydroxykynurenine. Based on its chemical structure, XA appears as a close analog of kynurenic acid which has been extensively investigated and is considered as a potent neuroprotective compound. Contrary to kynurenic acid (KYNA), XA has received little attention and its role in the brain remains not elucidated. We have previously described several characteristics of XA, suggesting its possible involvement in neurotransmission. XA is also proposed as a potential modulator at glutamatergic synapses. Here, we used a selective antibody against XA and various neuronal, glial and synaptic markers to show that XA is essentially localized in the soma and dendrites of brain neurons, but is absent from axonal compartments and terminal endings. Our results also reveal that XA-like immunoreactivity is not expressed by glial cells. To double-check our findings, we have also used another XA antibody obtained from a commercial source to confirm the neuronal expression of XA. Together, our results suggest that, differently to several other KPM produced by glial cells, XA exhibits a neuronal distribution in the mouse brain.

AB  - Abstract
The intrinsic cardiac nervous system modulates cardiac function by acting as an integration site for regulating autonomic efferent cardiac output. This intrinsic system is proposed to be composed of a short cardio-cardiac feedback control loop within the cardiac innervation hierarchy. For example, electrophysiological studies have postulated the presence of sensory neurons in intrinsic cardiac ganglia (ICG) for regional cardiac control. There is still a knowledge gap, however, about the anatomical location and neurochemical phenotype of sensory neurons inside ICG. In the present study, rat ICG neurons were characterized neurochemically with immunohistochemistry using glutamatergic markers: vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 (VGLUT1; VGLUT2), and glutaminase (GLS), the enzyme essential for glutamate production. Glutamatergic neurons (VGLUT1/VGLUT2/GLS) in the ICG that have axons to the ventricles were identified by retrograde tracing of wheat germ agglutinin–horseradish peroxidase (WGA–HRP) injected in the ventricular wall. Co-labeling of VGLUT1, VGLUT2, and GLS with the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) was used to evaluate the relationship between post-ganglionic autonomic neurons and glutamatergic neurons. Sequential labeling of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in adjacent tissue sections was used to evaluate the co-localization of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in ICG neurons. Our studies yielded the following results: (1) ICG contain glutamatergic neurons with GLS for glutamate production and VGLUT1 and 2 for transport of glutamate into synaptic vesicles; (2) atrial ICG contain neurons that project to ventricle walls and these neurons are glutamatergic; (3) many glutamatergic ICG neurons also were cholinergic, expressing VAChT; (4) VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 co-localization occurred in ICG neurons with variation of their protein expression level. Investigation of both glutamatergic and cholinergic ICG neurons could help in better understanding the function of the intrinsic cardiac nervous system.

AB  - Abstract
Brachial plexus injury (BPI) often involves the complete or partial avulsion of one or more of the cervical nerve roots, which leads to permanent paralysis of the innervated muscles. Reimplantation surgery has been attempted as a clinical treatment for brachial plexus root avulsion but has failed to achieve complete functional recovery. Lithium is a mood stabilizer drug that is used to treat bipolar disorder; however, its effects on spinal cord or peripheral nerve injuries have also been reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether lithium can improve functional motor recovery after ventral root avulsion and reimplantation in a rat model of BPI. The results showed that systemic treatment with a clinical dose of lithium promoted motor neuron outgrowth and increased the efficiency of motor unit regeneration through enhanced remyelination. An analysis of myelin-associated genes showed that the effects of lithium started during the early phase of remyelination and persisted through the late stage of the process. Efficient remyelination of the regenerated axons in the lithium-treated rats led to an earlier functional recovery. Therefore, we demonstrated that lithium might be a potential clinical treatment for BPI in combination with reimplantation surgery.

AB  - Abstract
htau mice are deficient of murine tau but express all six human tau isoforms, leading to gradual tau misprocessing and aggregation in brain areas relevant to Alzheimer’s disease. While histopathological changes in htau mice have been researched in the past, we focused here on functional consequences of human tau accumulation.

htau mice and their background controls – murine tau knock-out (mtau−/−) and C57Bl/6J mice – underwent a comprehensive trial battery to investigate species-specific behavior, locomotor activity, emotional responses, exploratory traits, spatial and recognition memory as well as acquisition, retention and extinction of contextual fear at two, four, six, nine and twelve months of age.

In htau mice, tau pathology was already present at two months of age, whereas deficits in food burrowing and spatial working memory were first noted at four months of age. At later stages the presence of human tau on a mtau−/− background appeared to guard cognitive performance; as mtau−/− but not htau mice differed from C57Bl/6J mice in the food burrowing, spontaneous alternation and object discrimination tasks. Aging mtau−/− mice also exhibited increased body mass and locomotor activity.

These data highlight that reduced food-burrowing performance was the most robust aspect of the htau phenotype with aging. htau and mtau−/− deficits in food burrowing pointed at the necessity of intact tau systems for daily life activities. While some htau and mtau−/− deficits overlap, age differences between the two genotypes may reflect distinct functional effects and compared to C57Bl/6J mice, the htau phenotype appeared stronger than the mtau−/− phenotype at young ages but milder with aging.

AB  - Abstract
The capacity to flexibly switch between different task rules has been previously associated with distributed fronto-parietal networks, predominantly in the left hemisphere for phasic switching sub-processes, and in the right hemisphere for more tonic aspects of task-switching, such as rule maintenance and management. It is thus likely that the white matter (WM) connectivity between these regions is critical in sustaining the flexibility required by task-switching. This study examined the relationship between WM microstructure in young adults and task-switching performance in different paradigms: classical shape-color, spatial and grammatical tasks. The main results showed an association between WM integrity in anterior portions of the corpus callosum (genu and body) and a sustained measure of task-switching performance. In particular, a higher fractional anisotropy and a lower radial diffusivity in these WM regions were associated with smaller mixing costs both in the spatial task-switching paradigm and in the shape-color one, as confirmed by a conjunction analysis. No association was found with behavioral measures obtained in the grammatical task-switching paradigm. The switch costs, a measure of phasic switching processes, were not correlated with WM microstructure in any task. This study shows that a more efficient inter-hemispheric connectivity within the frontal lobes favors sustained task-switching processes, especially with task contexts embedding non-verbal components.

AB  - Abstract
Autophagy plays an essential role in neurodevelopment, axonal guidance, neuropathic pain remission, and neuronal survival. Inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway can induce the occurrence of autophagy. In this study, we initially detected the effect of probucol on autophagy after spinal cord injury (SCI) by intraperitoneally injecting spinal cord-injured rats with probucol for 7 days. The levels of Beclin1 and LC3B were evidently enhanced at 7 days post-operation. However, the increase in the phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) protein and the decrease in ribosomal protein S6 kinase p70 subtype (p70S6K) phosphorylation level simultaneously occurred after SCI. Moreover, the expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins of Caspase-3, Caspase-9, and Bax were significantly reduced. Immunofluorescence results indicated that the expression of Caspase-3 protein was evidently decreased and that of Beclin-1 protein was increased by probucol. Nissl staining and Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores showed that the quantity and function of motor neurons were visibly preserved by probucol after SCI. This study showed that probucol inhibited the mTOR signaling pathway to induce autophagy, reduce neural cell apoptosis and promote recovery of neurological function after SCI.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic morphine treatment increases the levels of prohormone convertase 2 (PC2) in brain regions involved in nociception, tolerance and dependence. Thus, we tested if PC2 null mice exhibit altered morphine-induced antinociception, tolerance and dependence. PC2 null mice and their wild-type controls were tested for baseline hot plate latency, injected with morphine (1.25–10 mg/kg) and tested for antinociception 30 min later. For tolerance studies, mice were tested in the hot plate test before and 30 min following morphine (5 mg/kg) on day 1. Mice then received an additional dose so that the final dose of morphine was 10 mg/kg on this day. On days 2–4, mice received additional doses of morphine (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg on days 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively). On day 5, mice were tested in the hot plate test before and 30 min following morphine (5 mg/kg). For withdrawal studies, mice were treated with the escalating doses of morphine (10, 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg) for 4 days, implanted with a morphine pellet on day 5 and 3 days later injected with naloxone (1 mg/kg) and signs of withdrawal were recorded. Morphine dose-dependently induced antinociception and the magnitude of this response was greater in PC2 null mice. Tolerance to morphine was observed in wild-type mice and this phenomenon was blunted in PC2 null mice. Withdrawal signs were also reduced in PC2 null mice. Immunohistochemical studies showed up-regulation of the mu opioid receptor (MOP) protein expression in the periaqueductal gray area, ventral tegmental area, lateral hypothalamus, medial hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, and somatosensory cortex in PC2 null mice. Likewise, naloxone specific binding was increased in the brains of these mice compared to their wild-type controls. The results suggest that the PC2-derived peptides may play a functional role in morphine-induced antinociception, tolerance and dependence. Alternatively, lack of opioid peptides led to up-regulation of the MOP and altered morphine-induced antinociception, tolerance and dependence.

AB  - Abstract
Microglia are present throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and express receptors for every known neurotransmitter. During inflammation, microglia change into a state that either promotes removal of debris (M1), or into a state that promotes soothing (M2). Caudal- and rostral- ventrolateral medullary regions (CVLM and RVLM, respectively) of the brainstem are key nuclei involved in all aspects of the cardiovascular system. In this study, we investigate a novel role for microglia in cardiovascular control in the brainstem of adult male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rat. Here we show, that increases and decreases in blood pressure (BP) triggers alertness in the physiology of microglia in the brainstem region; inducing changes in microglial spatial distribution and the number of synapses in contact with microglial end processes. Following 6 h of acute hypertension, the number of synapses in contact with microglia increased by ≈30% in both regions of the brainstem, CVLM and RVLM. Induction of acute hypotension for 6 h causes microglia to reduce the number of synaptic contacts by &gt;20% in both, CVLM and RVLM, nuclei of the brainstem. Our analysis of the morphological characteristics of microglia, and expression levels of M1 and M2, reveals that the changes induced in microglial behavior do not require any obvious dramatic changes in their morphology. Taken together, our findings suggest that microglia play a novel, unexpected, physiological role in the uninjured autonomic nuclei of CNS; we therefore speculate that microglia act cooperatively with brainstem cardiovascular neurons to maintain them in a physiologically receptive state.

AB  - Abstract
Evidence suggests that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, may reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Statin action in patients with AD, as in those with heart disease, is likely to be at least partly independent of the effects of statins on cholesterol. Statins can alter cellular signaling and protein trafficking through inhibition of isoprenylation of Rho, Cdc42, and Rab family GTPases. The effects of statins on protein isoprenylation in vivo, particularly in the central nervous system, are poorly studied. We utilized two-dimensional gel electrophoresis approaches to directly monitor the levels of isoprenylated and non-isoprenylated forms of Rho and Rab family GTPases. We report that simvastatin significantly inhibits RhoA and Rab4, and Rab6 isoprenylation at doses as low as 50 nM in vitro. We also provide the first in vivo evidence that statins inhibit the isoprenylation of RhoA in the brains of rats and RhoA, Cdc42, and H-Ras in the brains of mice treated with clinically relevant doses of simvastatin.

AB  - Abstract
Huntington’s disease (HD) is characterized by progressive motor symptoms preceded by cognitive deficits and is regarded as a disorder that primarily affects the basal ganglia. The external globus pallidus (GPe) has a central role in the basal ganglia, projects directly to the cortex, and is majorly modulated by GABA. To gain a better understanding of the time course of HD progression and gain insight into the underlying mechanisms, we analyzed GABAergic neurotransmission in the GPe of the R6/1 mouse model at purportedly asymptomatic and symptomatic stages (i.e., 2 and 6 months). Western blot and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses revealed alterations in the GPe of male R6/1 mice compared with wild-type littermates. Expression of proteins involved in pre- and post-synaptic GABAergic compartments as well as synapse number were severely decreased at 2 and 6 months. At both ages, patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings showed a decrease of spontaneous and miniature inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSCs) suggesting that HD mutation has an early effect on the GABA signaling in the brain. Therefore, we performed continuous locomotor activity recordings from 2 to 4 months of age. Actigraphy analyses revealed rest/activity fragmentation alterations that parallel GABAergic system impairment at 2 months, while the locomotor deficit is evident only at 3 months in R6/1 mice. Our results reveal early deficits in HD and support growing evidence for a critical role played by the GPe in physiological and pathophysiological states. We suggest that actimetry may be used as a non-invasive tool to monitor early disease progression.

AB  - Abstract
To date, decoding accuracy of actual or imagined pointing movements to targets in 3D space from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals has remained modest. The reason may pertain to the fact that these movements activate essentially the same neural networks. In this study, we aimed at testing whether repetitive pointing movements to each of the targets promotes the development of segregated neural patterns, resulting in enhanced decoding accuracy. Six human subjects generated slow or fast repetitive pointing movements with their right dominant arm to one of five targets distributed in 3D space, followed by repetitive imagery of movements to the same target or to a different target. Nine naive subjects generated both repetitive and non-repetitive slow actual movements to each of the five targets to test the effect of block design on decoding accuracy. In order to assure that base line drift and low frequency motion artifacts do not contaminate the data, the data were high-pass filtered in 4–30 Hz, leaving out the delta and gamma band. For the repetitive trials, the model decoded target location with 81% accuracy, which is significantly higher than chance level. The average decoding rate of target location was only 30% for the non-repetitive trials, which is not significantly different than chance level. A subset of electrodes, mainly over the contralateral sensorimotor areas, was found to provide most of the discriminative features for all tested conditions. Time proximity between trained and tested blocks was found to enhance decoding accuracy of target location both by target non-specific and specific mechanisms. Our findings suggest that movement repetition promotes the development of distinct neural patterns, presumably by the formation of target-specific kinesthetic memory.

AB  - Abstract
Activation of angiotensinergic pathways by central aldosterone (Aldo)-mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) pathway plays a critical role in angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertension. The subfornical organ (SFO) contains both MR and angiotensin II type 1 receptors (AT1R) and can relay the signals of circulating Ang II to downstream nuclei such as the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), supraoptic nucleus (SON) and rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). In Wistar rats, subcutaneous (sc) infusion of Ang II at 500 ng/min/kg for 1 or 2 weeks increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) as measured by dihydroethidium (DHE) staining in a nucleus – specific pattern. Intra-SFO infusion of AAV-MR- or AT1aR-siRNA prevented the Ang II-induced increase in AT1R mRNA expression in the SFO and decreased MR mRNA. Both MR- and AT1aR-siRNA prevented increases in ROS in the PVN and RVLM. MR- but not AT1aR-siRNA in the SFO prevented the Ang II-induced ROS in the SON. Both MR- and AT1aR-siRNA in the SFO prevented most of the Ang II-induced hypertension as assessed by telemetry. These results indicate that Aldo-MR signaling in the SFO is needed for the activation of Ang II-AT1R-ROS signaling from the SFO to the PVN and RVLM. Activation of Aldo-MR signaling from the SFO to the SON may enhance AT1R dependent activation of pre-sympathetic neurons in the PVN.

AB  - Abstract
The present study generated a novel DNA complex to specifically target endothelial NF-κB to inhibit cerebral vascular inflammation. This DNA complex (GS24-NFκB) contains a DNA decoy which inhibits NF-κB activity, and a DNA aptamer (GS-24), a ligand of transferrin receptor (TfR), which allows for targeted delivery of the DNA decoy into cells. The results indicate that GS24-NFκB was successfully delivered into a murine brain-derived endothelial cell line, bEND5, and inhibited inflammatory responses induced by tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) or oxygen-glucose deprivation/re-oxygenation (OGD/R) via down-regulation of the nuclear NF-κB subunit, p65, as well as its downstream inflammatory cytokines, inter-cellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1). The inhibitory effect of the GS24-NFκB was demonstrated by a significant reduction in TNF-α or OGD/R induced monocyte adhesion to the bEND5 cells after GS24-NFκB treatment. Intravenous (i.v.) injection of GS24-‘NFκB (15 mg/kg) was able to inhibit the levels of phoseph-p65 and VCAM-1 in brain endothelial cells in a mouse lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory model in vivo. In conclusion, our approach using DNA nanotechnology for DNA decoy delivery could potentially be utilized for inhibition of inflammation in ischemic stroke and other neuro-inflammatory diseases affecting cerebral vasculature.

AB  - Abstract
Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is known to increase the force-generating capacity of the skeletal muscles. However, when tDCS is concurrently combined with a motor task, interference may occur that hinders tDCS effects. Here, we tested the interaction and time course of tDCS effects on force production when paired with a low-level force-matching task. Twenty-two subjects were randomized into two groups: tDCS-Matching and tDCS-Resting. Each group received tDCS and a sham stimulation, separated by one week. Maximal knee extensor and flexor torques were measured before and up to twenty-five minutes following the stimulation. The tDCS-Matching group produced greater knee extension torques relative to sham when compared with the tDCS-Resting group. There was no significant effect for knee flexion. This suggests that interference does not occur for force production tasks when tDCS is combined with a motor task. Rather, the task appears to aid and isolate the effects to the muscle groups involved in the task.

AB  - Abstract
Dopamine and glutamate play critical roles in the reinforcing effects of cocaine. We demonstrated that a single intraperitoneal administration of cocaine induces a significant decrease in [3H]-d-aspartate uptake in the pre-frontal cortex (PFC). This decrease is associated with elevated dopamine levels, and requires dopamine D1-receptor signaling (D1R) and adenylyl cyclase activation. The effect was observed within 10 min of cocaine administration and lasted for up to 30 min. This rapid response is related to D1R-mediated cAMP-mediated activation of PKA and phosphorylation of the excitatory amino acid transporters EAAT1, EAAT2 and EAAT3. We also demonstrated that cocaine exposure increases extracellular d-aspartate, l-glutamate and d-serine in the PFC. Our data suggest that cocaine activates dopamine D1 receptor signaling and PKA pathway to regulate EAATs function and extracellular EAA level in the PFC.

AB  - Abstract
Increasing evidence has established the involvement of the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) in the process of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and subsequent apoptosis through modulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Recent studies have shown that treatment with Ro5-4864, a TSPO ligand, resulted in a neuroprotective effect in traumatic brain injury. Yet, the nature of this effect remained uncertain as mature neurons are considered to be lacking the TSPO protein. In order to investigate the mechanism of Ro5-4864-mediated neuroprotection, the neuro-inflammatory and neurosteroid response to cortical injury was tested in sham-operated, vehicle, cyclosporine A (CsA) and Ro5-4864-treated rats. As anticipated, the levels of interleukin 1β and tumor necrosis factor α, as well as the astrocyte and microglia cellular density in the injured area were all decreased by CsA in comparison with the vehicle group. By contrast, no visible effect could be observed in Ro5-4864-treated animals. None of the groups showed any significant difference with any other in respect with the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Double immunofluorescence staining with NeuN and TSPO confirmed the absence of TSPO in native neurons though showed clear evidence of co-localization of TSPO in the cytoplasm of NeuN-stained injured neurons. Altogether, this study shows that the neuronal protection mediated by Ro5-4864 in brain injury cannot be solely attributed to an indirect effect of the ligand on glial TSPO but may also represent the consequence of the modulation of upregulated TSPO in injured neurons. This observation may be of importance for future pharmacological research in neurotrauma.

AB  - Abstract
Principles of negative reinforcement learning may play a critical role in the etiology and treatment of depression. We examined the integrity of positive reinforcement learning in congenitally helpless (cH) rats, an animal model of depression, using a random ratio schedule and a devaluation-extinction procedure. Furthermore, we tested whether an antidepressant dose of the monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitor deprenyl would reverse any deficits in positive reinforcement learning. We found that cH rats (n = 9) were impaired in the acquisition of even simple operant contingencies, such as a fixed interval (FI) 20 schedule. cH rats exhibited no apparent deficits in appetite or reward sensitivity. They reacted to the devaluation of food in a manner consistent with a dose–response relationship. Reinforcer motivation as assessed by lever pressing across sessions with progressively decreasing reward probabilities was highest in congenitally non-helpless (cNH, n = 10) rats as long as the reward probabilities remained relatively high. cNH compared to wild-type (n = 10) rats were also more resistant to extinction across sessions. Compared to saline (n = 5), deprenyl (n = 5) reduced the duration of immobility of cH rats in the forced swimming test, indicative of antidepressant effects, but did not restore any deficits in the acquisition of a FI 20 schedule. We conclude that positive reinforcement learning was impaired in rats bred for helplessness, possibly due to motivational impairments but not deficits in reward sensitivity, and that deprenyl exerted antidepressant effects but did not reverse the deficits in positive reinforcement learning.

AB  - Abstract
Neurochemical alterations in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) include cholinergic neuronal loss in the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM) and a decrease in densities of the M2 muscarinic receptor subtype in areas related to learning and memory. Neuromodulators present in the cholinergic pathways, such as neuropeptides and neurolipids, control these cognitive processes and have become targets of research in order to understand and treat the pathophysiological and clinical stages of the disease. This is the case of the endocannabinoid and galaninergic systems, which have been found to be up-regulated in AD, and could therefore have a neuroprotective role. In the present study, the functional coupling of Gi/o protein-coupled receptors to GalR1, and the CB1 receptor subtype for endocannabinoids were analyzed in the 3xTg-AD mice model of AD. In addition, the activity mediated by Gi/o protein-coupled M2/4 muscarinic receptor subtypes was also analyzed in brain areas involved in anxiety and cognition. Thus, male mice were studied at 4 and 15 months of age (prodromal and advanced stages, respectively) and compared to age-matched non-transgenic (NTg) mice (adult and old, respectively). In 4-month-old 3xTg-AD mice, the [35S]GTPγS binding stimulated by galanin was significantly increased in the hypothalamus, but a decrease of functional M2/4 receptors was observed in the posterior amygdala. The CB1 cannabinoid receptor activity was up-regulated in the anterior thalamus at that age. In 15-month-old 3xTg-AD mice, muscarinic receptor activity was found to be increased in motor cortex, while CB1 activity was decreased in nbM. No changes were found in GalR1-mediated activity at this age. Our results provide further evidence of the relevance of limbic areas in the prodromal stage of AD, the profile of which is characterized by anxiety. The up-regulation of galaninergic and endocannabinoid systems support the hypothesis of their neuroprotective roles, and these are established prior to the onset of clear clinical cognitive symptoms of the disease.

AB  - Abstract
Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) often present with bimanual coordination deficits whose exact origins remain unclear. One aspect of bimanual coordination is inter-limb coupling. This is characterized by the harmonization of movement parameters between limbs. We assessed different aspects of bimanual coordination in patients with PD, including inter-limb coupling, and determined whether they are altered by subthalamic (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) or dopaminergic medication. Twenty PD patients were tested before STN DBS surgery; with and without medication. Post- surgery, patients were tested with their stimulators on and off as well as with and without medication. Patients were asked to perform a unimanual and bimanual rapid repetitive diadochokinesis task. The difference in mean amplitude and mean duration of cycles between hands was computed in order to assess inter-limb coupling. Also, mean angular velocity of both hands and structural coupling were computed for the bimanual task. There was a positive effect of medication and stimulation on mean angular velocity, which relates to clinical improvement. PD patients exhibited temporal inter-limb coupling that was not altered by either medication or STN stimulation. However, PD patients did not exhibit spatial inter-limb coupling. Again, this was not altered by medication or stimulation. Collectively, the results suggest that structures independent of the dopaminergic system and basal ganglia may mediate temporal and spatial inter-limb coupling.

AB  - Abstract
Accumulating evidence indicates that odontoblasts act as sensor cells, capable of triggering action potentials in adjacent pulpal nociceptive axons, suggesting a paracrine signaling via a currently unknown mediator. Since glutamate can mediate signaling by non-neuronal cells, and peripheral axons may express glutamate receptors (GluR), we hypothesized that the expression of high levels of glutamate, and of sensory receptors in odontoblasts, combined with an expression of GluR in adjacent pulpal axons, is the morphological basis for odontoblastic sensory signaling. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the expression of glutamate, the thermo- and mechanosensitive ion channels transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), and TWIK-1-related K + channel (TREK-1), and the glutamate receptor mGluR5, in a normal rat dental pulp, and following dentin injury. We also examined the glutamate release from odontoblast in cell culture.

Odontoblasts were enriched with glutamate, at the level as high as in adjacent pulpal axons, and showed immunoreactivity for TRPV1, TRPA1, and TREK-1. Pulpal sensory axons adjacent to odontoblasts expressed mGluR5. Both the levels of glutamate in odontoblasts, and the expression of mGluR5 in nearby axons, were upregulated following dentin injury. The extracellular glutamate concentration was increased significantly after treating of odontoblast cell line with calcium permeable ionophore, suggesting glutamate release from odontoblasts.

These findings lend morphological support to the hypothesis that odontoblasts contain glutamate as a potential neuroactive substance that may activate adjacent pulpal axons, and thus contribute to dental pain and hypersensitivity.

AB  - Abstract
Despite the fact that appropriate social behaviors are vital to thriving in one’s environment, little is understood of the molecular mechanisms controlling social behaviors or how social experience sculpts these signaling pathways. Here, we determine if Phosphodiesterase 11A (PDE11A), an enzyme that is enriched in the ventral hippocampal formation (VHIPP) and that breaks down cAMP and cGMP, regulates social behaviors. PDE11 wild-type (WT), heterozygous (HT), and knockout (KO) mice were tested in various social approach assays and gene expression differences were measured by RNA sequencing. The effect of social isolation on PDE11A4 compartmentalization and subsequent social interactions and social memory was also assessed. Deletion of PDE11A triggered age- and sex-dependent deficits in social approach in specific social contexts but not others. Mice appear to detect altered social behaviors of PDE11A KO mice, because C57BL/6J mice prefer to spend time with a sex-matched PDE11A WT vs. its KO littermate; whereas, a PDE11A KO prefers to spend time with a novel PDE11A KO vs. its WT littermate. Not only is PDE11A required for intact social interactions, we found that 1 month of social isolation vs. group housing decreased PDE11A4 protein expression specifically within the membrane fraction of VHIPP. This isolation-induced decrease in PDE11A4 expression appears functional because social isolation impairs subsequent social approach behavior and social memory in a PDE11A genotype-dependent manner. Pathway analyses following RNA sequencing suggests PDE11A is a key regulator of the oxytocin pathway and membrane signaling, consistent with its pivotal role in regulating social behavior.

AB  - Abstract
Hydrogen is a kind of noble gas with the character to selectively neutralize reactive oxygen species. Former researches proved that low-concentration of hydrogen can be used to ameliorating cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Hydrogen electrolyzed from water has a hydrogen concentration of 66.7%, which is much higher than that used in previous studies. And water electrolysis is a potential new hydrogen resource for regular clinical use. This study was designed and carried out for the determination of safety and neuroprotective effects of water electrolysis-derived hydrogen. Sprague–Dawley rats were used as experimental animals, and middle cerebral artery occlusion was used to make cerebral ischemia/reperfusion model. Pathologically, tissues from rats in hydrogen inhalation group showed no significant difference compared with the control group in HE staining pictures. The blood biochemical findings matched the HE staining result. TTC, Nissl, and TUNEL staining showed the significant improvement of infarction volume, neuron morphology, and neuron apoptosis in rat with hydrogen treatment. Biochemically, hydrogen inhalation decreased brain caspase-3, 3-nitrotyrosine and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine-positive cells and inflammation factors concentration. Water electrolysis-derived hydrogen inhalation had neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats with the effect of suppressing oxidative stress and inflammation, and it is a possible new hydrogen resource to electrolyze water at the bedside clinically.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic intermittent alcohol (CIA) exposure produces altered motivational states characterized by anxiety and escalated alcohol consumption during withdrawal. The endocannabinoid (ECB) system contributes to these symptoms, and sex differences in alcohol dependence, as well as bidirectional interactions between ECBs and gonadal hormones have been documented. Thus, we evaluated sex differences in alcohol consumption, anxiety-like behavior, and ECB mRNA expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of alcohol-dependent rats during acute withdrawal. Male rats exposed to six weeks of CIA showed escalated alcohol consumption during acute withdrawal and reductions in NAc N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D (NAPEPLD), DAG lipase alpha (DAGLα), and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) mRNA. Intact alcohol-dependent female rats also escalated their consumption, but notably, this effect was also present in non-dependent females. No differences in NAc ECB mRNA were observed between CIA- and air-exposed females during acute withdrawal. However, when these data were analyzed according to estrous stage, significant differences in NAPEPLD and MAGL mRNA expression emerged in the NAc of air-exposed control rats, which were absent in alcohol-dependent females. We subsequently measured alcohol consumption and NAc ECB mRNA in ovariectomized (OVX) females with or without estradiol (E2) replacement during withdrawal. Neither E2 nor CIA altered alcohol consumption in OVX females. However, E2 reduced both DAGLα and MAGL mRNA, suggesting that E2 may influence the biosynthesis and degradation of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in the NAc. Collectively, these studies indicate sexual dimorphism in alcohol consumption in non-dependent rats and suggest that E2-mediated alterations in NAc ECB mRNA expression during withdrawal may be a mechanism by which sex differences in alcohol dependence emerge.

AB  - Abstract
The central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC) contains a laminar structure that functions as an organizing substrate of ascending inputs and local processing. While topographic distributions of ICC response parameters within and across laminae have been reported, the functional micro-organization of the ICC is less well understood. For pairs of neighboring ICC neurons, we examined the nature of functional connectivity and receptive field preferences to gain a better understanding of the structure and function of local circuits. By recording from pairs of adjacent neurons and presenting pure-tone and dynamic broad-band stimulation, we estimated functional connectivity and local differences in frequency response areas (FRAs), spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs), nonlinear input/output functions, and single-spike information. From the cross-covariance functions we identified putative unidirectional as well as bidirectional excitatory/inhibitory interactions. STRFs of neighboring neurons strongly conserve best frequency, and moderately agree in STRF similarity, bandwidth, temporal response type, best modulation frequency, nonlinearity structure, and degree of information processing. Excitatory connectivity was stronger and temporally more precise than for inhibitory connections. Neither connection strength nor degree of synchrony correlated with receptive field parameters. The functional similarity of local pairs of ICC neurons was substantially less than for local pairs in the granular layers of primary auditory cortex (AI). These results imply that while the ICC is an obligatory nexus of ascending information, local neurons are comparatively weakly connected and exhibit considerable receptive field variability, potentially reflecting the heterogeneity of converging inputs to ICC functional zones.

AB  - Abstract
Investigation of the neural basis of self-generated thought is moving beyond a simple identification with default network activation toward a more comprehensive view recognizing the role of the frontoparietal control network and other areas. A major task ahead is to unravel the functional roles and temporal dynamics of the widely distributed brain regions recruited during self-generated thought. We argue that various other neuroscientific methods – including lesion studies, human intracranial electrophysiology, and manipulation of neurochemistry – have much to contribute to this project. These diverse data have yet to be synthesized with the growing understanding of self-generated thought gained from neuroimaging, however. Here, we highlight several areas of ongoing inquiry and illustrate how evidence from other methodologies corroborates, complements, and clarifies findings from functional neuroimaging. Each methodology has particular strengths: functional neuroimaging reveals much about the variety of brain areas and networks reliably recruited. Lesion studies point to regions critical to generating and consciously experiencing self-generated thought. Human intracranial electrophysiology illuminates how and where in the brain thought is generated and where this activity subsequently spreads. Finally, measurement and manipulation of neurotransmitter and hormone levels can clarify what kind of neurochemical milieu drives or facilitates self-generated cognition. Integrating evidence from multiple complementary modalities will be a critical step on the way to improving our understanding of the neurobiology of functional and dysfunctional forms of self-generated thought.

AB  - Abstract
There is a strong need to better understand the neurobiology of juvenile sociability (tendency to seek social interaction), a phenotype of central relevance to autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Although numerous genetic mouse models of ASD showing reduced sociability have been reported, and certain brain regions, such as the amygdala, have been implicated in sociability, there has been little emphasis on delineating brain structures and circuits activated during social interactions in the critical juvenile period of the mouse strain that serves as the most common genetic background for these models—the highly sociable C57BL/6J (B6) strain. We measured expression of the immediate early genes Fos and Egr-1 to map activation of brain regions following the Social Approach Test (SAT) in juvenile male B6 mice. We hypothesized that juvenile B6 mice would show activation of the amygdala during social interactions. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) was activated by social exposure in highly sociable, 4-week-old B6 mice. In light of these data, and the many lines of evidence indicating alteration of amygdala circuits in human ASD, future studies are warranted to assess structural and functional alterations in the BLA, particularly at BLA synapses, in various mouse models of ASD.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic discontinuous use of many psychomotor stimulants leads to behavioral sensitization and, owing to it shares common mechanisms with relapse, most researchers use its animal model to explore the neurobiological mechanisms of addiction. Recent studies have proved that N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are implicated in psychomotor stimulant-induced behavioral sensitization. However, the function of GluN2B-containing NMDARs and their potential downstream cascade(s) in the acquisition and expression of behavioral sensitization to methamphetamine (METH) have not been explored. In this study, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg ifenprodil, the specific inhibitor of GluN2B, was used to explore the function of these receptors in distinct phases of behavioral sensitization to METH in mice. Then, using western blot, Ras, pERK1/2/ERK1/2, and ΔFosB levels in the prefrontal cortex (PFc), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and caudate putamen (CPu) were detected. Behavioral results showed that low-dose ifenprodil attenuated the acquisition and expression of behavioral sensitization to METH significantly. Western blot analysis revealed that pre-injection of low-dose ifenprodil in the acquisition markedly attenuated METH-induced ascent of Ras, pERK1/2/ERK1/2, and ΔFosB protein levels in the CPu. However, pre-treatment in the expression only affected the alterations of Ras and pERK1/2/ERK1/2 levels in the CPu. Moreover, chronic METH administration increased pERK1/2/ERK1/2 level in the NAc. In conclusion, GluN2B-containing NMDARs contribute to both the acquisition and expression of behavioral sensitization to METH in mice. Furthermore, the acquisition phase might be mediated by the Ras-ERK1/2-ΔFosB cascade in the CPu while the expression phase may be regulated by the Ras-ERK1/2 cascade in the CPu.

AB  - Abstract
The rhythmic activity of motoneurons (MNs) that underlies locomotion in mammals is generated by synaptic inputs from the locomotor network in the spinal cord. Thus, the quantitative estimation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances is essential to understand the mechanism by which the network generates the functional motor output. Conductance estimation is obtained from the voltage–current relationship measured by voltage-clamp- or current-clamp-recording with knowledge of the leak parameters of the recorded neuron. However, it is often difficult to obtain sufficient data to estimate synaptic conductances due to technical difficulties in electrophysiological experiments using in vivo or in vitro preparations. To address this problem, we estimated the average variations in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductance during a locomotion cycle from a single voltage trace without measuring the leak parameters. We found that the conductance variations can be accurately reconstructed from a voltage trace of 10 cycles by analyzing synthetic data generated from a computational model. Next, the conductance variations were estimated from mouse spinal MNs in vitro during drug-induced-locomotor-like activity. We found that the peak of excitatory conductance occurred during the depolarizing phase of the locomotor cycle, whereas the peak of inhibitory conductance occurred during the hyperpolarizing phase. These results suggest that the locomotor-like activity is generated by push–pull modulation via excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs.

AB  - Abstract
Intravenous infusion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from adult bone marrow improves behavioral function in rat models of spinal cord injury (SCI). However, most studies have focused on the acute or subacute phase of SCI. In the present study, MSCs derived from bone marrow of rats were intravenously infused 10 weeks after the induction of a severe contusive SCI. Open field locomotor function was assessed weekly until 20 weeks post-SCI. Motor recovery was greater in the MSC-treated group with rapid improvement beginning in earlier post-infusion times than in the vehicle-treated group. Blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) integrity was assessed by the intravenous infusion of Evans Blue (EvB) with spectrophotometric quantitation of its leakage into the parenchyma. In MSC-treated rats, BSCB leakage was reduced. Immunohistochemical staining for RECA-1 and PDGFR-β showed increased microvasculature/repair-neovascularization in MSC-treated rats. There was extensive remyelination around the lesion center and increased sprouting of the corticospinal tract and serotonergic fibers after MSC infusion. These results indicate that the systemic infusion of MSCs results in functional improvement that is associated with structural changes in the chronically injured spinal cord including stabilization of the BSCB, axonal sprouting/regeneration and remyelination.

AB  - Abstract
The autosomal recessive Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy with Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum (HMSN/ACC) is associated with the dysfunction of the K+–Cl− cotransporter type 3 (KCC3), which is an electroneutral cotransporter. We previously found that the inhibition of KCC3 cotransporter activity reduces the propagation of action potentials in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). However, the pathogenesis by which KCC3 deficiency impairs peripheral nerve function remains to be examined. Thus, we conducted imaging and electrophysiological studies in the peripheral nerves of KCC3−/− mice at various ages. Analysis using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed an age-dependent progressive swelling of microvilli and disorganization of paranodal loops in KCC3−/− nerves. Yet, no mislocated voltage-dependent channels were observed between the nodes and juxtaparanodes of KCC3−/− nerves. However, electrophysiological studies using the threshold tracking technique indicated a reduced stimulus–response curve slope with an elevated rheobase, a decreased strength–duration time constant, diminished persistent Na+ currents, and an outward deviation of threshold electrotonus in KCC3−/− nerves compared to wild-type nerves. These functional changes indicate an overall reduction in axonal excitability and suggest an increase in paranodal conductance, which was relevant to the pathology at the paranode. Altogether, our findings highlight the importance of KCC3 in maintaining paranodal integrity and in optimizing the propagation of action potentials along peripheral nerves.

AB  - Abstract
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has become a popular method of modulating neural plasticity in humans. Clinically, rTMS is delivered at high intensities to modulate neuronal excitability. While the high-intensity magnetic field can be targeted to stimulate specific cortical regions, areas adjacent to the targeted area receive stimulation at a lower intensity and may contribute to the overall plasticity induced by rTMS. We have previously shown that low-intensity rTMS induces molecular and structural plasticity in vivo, but the effects on membrane properties and neural excitability have not been investigated. Here we investigated the acute effect of low-intensity repetitive magnetic stimulation (LI-rMS) on neuronal excitability and potential changes on the passive and active electrophysiological properties of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in vitro. Whole-cell current clamp recordings were made at baseline prior to subthreshold LI-rMS (600 pulses of iTBS, n = 9 cells from 7 animals) or sham (n = 10 cells from 9 animals), immediately after stimulation, as well as 10 and 20 min post-stimulation. Our results show that LI-rMS does not alter passive membrane properties (resting membrane potential and input resistance) but hyperpolarises action potential threshold and increases evoked spike-firing frequency. Increases in spike firing frequency were present throughout the 20 min post-stimulation whereas action potential (AP) threshold hyperpolarization was present immediately after stimulation and at 20 min post-stimulation. These results provide evidence that LI-rMS alters neuronal excitability of excitatory neurons. We suggest that regions outside the targeted region of high-intensity rTMS are susceptible to neuromodulation and may contribute to rTMS-induced plasticity.

Glutathione (GSH) deficiency has been identified as an early event in the progression of Parkinson’s disease. However, the role of GSH in the etiology and pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative disorder is not well established. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of transient GSH depletion in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) on neuroinflammation after the injection of a single dose of l-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) into the SNpc of male Sprague–Dawley rats. The results showed that BSO treatment stimulates microglia (p &lt; 0.01) and astroglial response (p &lt; 0.01), c-Jun N-terminal kinase and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (p &lt; 0.001) in the SNpc, accompanied by dopaminergic dysfunction. In addition, high levels of tumor necrosis factor α (p &lt; 0.01), interleukins IL-1β p &lt; 0.01), IL-6 p &lt; 0.001) and nitric oxide p &lt; 0.01) were found in the treated animals compared to control groups, while no significant differences were found in IL-10 levels. These results suggest that transient GSH depletion can increase the susceptibility of SNpc to degeneration by promoting an inflammatory response and nitrosative stress, reinforcing the possible role of GSH unbalance, oxygen/nitrogen reactive species and neuroinflammation as causal factors on the degeneration of the SNpc.

AB  - Abstract
Microinjection of morphine into the periaqueductal gray (PAG) produces antinociception. In vitro slice recordings indicate that all PAG neurons are sensitive to morphine either by direct inhibition or indirect disinhibition. We tested the hypothesis that all PAG neurons respond to opioids in vivo by examining the extracellular activity of PAG neurons recorded in lightly anesthetized and awake rats. Spontaneous activity was less than 1 Hz in most neurons. Noxious stimuli (heat, pinch) caused an increase in activity in 57% and 75% of the neurons recorded in anesthetized and awake rats, respectively. The same noxious stimuli caused a decrease in activity in only 17% and 6% of neurons recorded in anesthetized and awake rats. Systemic administration of morphine caused approximately equal numbers of neurons to increase, decrease, or show no change in activity in lightly anesthetized rats. In contrast, administration of morphine caused an increase in the activity of 22 of the 27 neurons recorded in awake rats. No change in activity was evident in the remaining five neurons. Changes in activity caused by morphine were surprisingly modest (a median increase from 0.7 to 1.3 Hz). The small inconsistent effects of morphine are in stark contrast to the large changes produced by morphine on the activity of rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) neurons or the widespread inhibition and excitation of PAG neurons treated with opioids in in vitro slice experiments. The relatively modest effects of morphine in the present study suggest that morphine produces antinociception by causing small changes in the activity of many PAG neurons.

Limb somatosensory signals modify the discharge of vestibular neurons and elicit postural reflexes, which stabilize the body position. The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of the γ-amino-butyric-acid (GABA) to the responsiveness of vestibular neurons to somatosensory inputs. The activity of 128 vestibular units was recorded in anesthetized rats in resting conditions and during sinusoidal foreleg rotation around the elbow or shoulder joints (0.026–0.625 Hz, 45° peak amplitude). None of the recorded units was influenced by elbow rotation, while 40% of them responded to shoulder rotation. The selective GABAA antagonist receptor, bicuculline methiodine (BIC), was applied by microiontophoresis on single vestibular neurons and the changes in their activity at rest and during somatosensory stimulation was studied. In about half of cells the resting activity increased after the BIC application: 75% of these neurons showed also an increased response to somatosensory inputs whereas 17% exhibited a decrease. Changes in responsiveness in both directions were detected also in the units whose resting activity was not influenced by BIC. These data suggest that the responses of vestibular neurons to somatosensory inputs are modulated by GABA through a tonic release, which modifies the membrane response to the synaptic current. It is also possible that a phasic release of GABA occurs during foreleg rotation, shaping the stimulus-elicited current passing through the membrane. If this is the case, the changes in the relative position of body segments would modify the GABA release inducing changes in the vestibular reflexes and in learning processes that modify their spatio-temporal development.

AB  - Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common type of clinical dementia. Previous studies have demonstrated that hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is implicated with the pathology of AD, and exogenous H2S attenuates spatial memory impairments in AD animal models. However, the molecular mechanism by which H2S improves cognition in AD has not been fully explored. Here, we report that chronic administration of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, a H2S donor) elevated hippocampal H2S levels and enhanced hippocampus-dependent contextual fear memory and novel object recognition in amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin-1 (PS1) transgenic mice. In parallel with these behavioral results, treating transgenic mice with NaHS reversed impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), which is deemed as the neurobiological basis of learning and memory. At the molecular level, we found that treatment with NaHS did not affect the expression of the GluN1 and GluN2A subunits of NMDA receptor (NMDAR), but did prevent the downregulation of GluN2B subunit and restored its synaptic abundance, response and downstream signaling in the hippocampus in transgenic mice. Moreover, applying Ro 25-6981, a specific GluN2B antagonist, abolished the beneficial effects of NaHS on cognitive performance and hippocampal LTP in transgenic mice. Collectively, our results indicate that H2S can reverse cognitive and synaptic plasticity deficits in AD model mice by restoring surface GluN2B expression and the function of GluN2B-containing NMDARs.

Males are more susceptible than females to long-term cognitive deficits following neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in the pathophysiology of cerebral hypoxia–ischemia (HI), but the influence of sex on mitochondrial quality control (MQC) after HI is unknown. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that mitophagy is sexually dimorphic and neuroprotective 20–24 h following the Rice–Vannucci model of rat neonatal HI at postnatal day 7 (PN7). Mitochondrial and lysosomal morphology and degree of co-localization were determined by immunofluorescence in the cerebral cortex. No difference in mitochondrial abundance was detected in the cortex after HI. However, net mitochondrial fission increased in both hemispheres of female brain, but was most extensive in the ipsilateral hemisphere of male brain following HI. Basal autophagy, assessed by immunoblot for the autophagosome marker LC3BI/II, was greater in males suggesting less intrinsic reserve capacity for autophagy following HI. Autophagosome formation, lysosome size, and TOM20/LAMP2 co-localization were increased in the contralateral hemisphere following HI in female, but not male brain. An accumulation of ubiquitinated mitochondrial protein was observed in male, but not female brain following HI. Moreover, neuronal cell death with NeuN/TUNEL co-staining occurred in both hemispheres of male brain, but only in the ipsilateral hemisphere of female brain after HI. In summary, mitophagy induction and neuronal cell death are sex dependent following HI. The deficit in elimination of damaged/dysfunctional mitochondria in the male brain following HI may contribute to male vulnerability to neuronal death and long-term neurobehavioral deficits following HIE.

AB  - Abstract
Although previous research has demonstrated that traumatic brain injury (TBI) accelerates the proliferation of neural stem cells in dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, most of these newborn cells undergo apoptosis in a traumatic microenvironment. Thus, promoting the long-term survival of newborn cells during neurogenesis is a compelling goal for the treatment of TBI. In this study, we investigated whether mild hypothermia (MHT) therapy, which mitigates the multiple secondary injury cascades of TBI, enhances the survival of newborn cells. SD rats were subjected to unilateral fluid percussion injury and received MHT therapy for 4 h (33.5 °C). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered to label the mitotic cells. Spatial learning and memory were evaluated with the Morris water maze test. Brain sections were immunostained with antibodies against BrdU, DCX (a neuroblast marker) or NeuN (a mature neuron marker). The apoptosis levels in the dentate gyrus were examined with antibodies against the apoptotic proteins FAS, FASL, Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase 3. The results indicated that MHT could significantly prevent TBI-induced cognitive impairments. At 1 week after injury, the density of BrdU-immunoreactive cells significantly increased in both TBI and TBI + MHT rats. At 4 weeks after injury, the density of BrdU-positive cells further increased in TBI + MHT rats, whereas the density declined in the TBI rats. The density of DCX-positive cells in SGZ of the hippocampus at 1 week after injury in the TBI + MHT rats was significantly greater than in the TBI rats. Moreover, the density of NeuN-positive cells in the subgranular zone at 4 weeks after injury and in the granule cell layer at 7 weeks after injury was significantly increased in the TBI + MHT rats. The TBI + MHT rats displayed a lower level of apoptosis in the dentate gyrus compared with the TBI rats. These data indicate that TBI could only facilitate a burst of proliferation and short-term survival of newborn cells, whereas TBI + MHT could facilitate long-term survival and maturation of newborn cells through diminishing pro-apoptotic microenvironment. These results suggest that MHT-mediated neurogenesis may have an important therapeutic potential for the endogenous repair of TBI.

AB  - Abstract
Children exposed to general anesthetics such as isoflurane are maybe at an increased risk of cognitive impairment. Recent studies have indicated that this kind of cognitive decline is associated with neuroinflammation in the hippocampus of neonatal rodents. Glycyrrhizin is a naturally available compound for the treatment of inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases. We therefore aimed to investigate the effects of glycyrrhizin on the isoflurane-induced cognitive deficits and hippocampal neuroinflammation in the neonatal rats. Seven day-old rats were exposed to 1.8% isoflurane for 4 h. Saline and glycyrrhizin solution was injected intraperitoneally 30 min prior to isoflurane or control gas exposure. The effects of isoflurane and glycyrrhizin treatment on memory performance were examined using Morris Water Maze (MWM) task. The protein expression of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), NFκB, Bcl-2, Bax and cleaved (active) caspase-3 were determined by Western blot assay. The protein levels of TNF-α and IL-1β were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The combination of ELISA and Western blot results showed that glycyrrhizin attenuated isoflurane-induced increases of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β) and activation of HMGB1/NFκB signaling pathway in the hippocampus of neonatal rats. Furthermore, glycyrrhizin treatment prevented the deficits in spatial memory induced by neonatal exposure to isoflurane. Consistent with these observations, we found that glycyrrhizin alleviated isoflurane-induced neuroapoptosis and down-regulations of PSD-95 and SNAP-25 in the hippocampus of neonatal rats. These results suggest that glycyrrhizin may be a potential therapeutic agent for developmental neurotoxicity and subsequent cognitive decline induced by neonatal exposure to general anesthetics.

AB  - Abstract
Dopamine is often used to treat hypotension in preterm infants; these infants are at risk of developing brain injury due to impaired autoregulation and cerebral hypoperfusion. However the effects of dopamine on the immature brain under conditions of cerebral hypoxia are not known. We hypothesized that pretreatment with dopamine would protect the immature brain from injury caused by cerebral hypoxia. Preterm fetal sheep were used to determine the effects of intravenous dopamine on hypoxia-induced brain injury.

In 16 pregnant sheep at 90 days of gestation (0.6 of term, term = 147 days) catheters were implanted aseptically into the fetal carotid artery and jugular vein; an inflatable occluder was placed loosely around the umbilical cord for later induction of fetal hypoxemia. At 5 days after surgery, dopamine (10 μg/kg/min, n = 7 fetuses) or saline (n = 9 fetuses) was infused for 74 h. Two hours after commencing the dopamine/saline infusion, we induced umbilical cord occlusion (UCO) for up to 25 min to produce fetal asphyxia. Fetuses were allowed to recover, and brains were collected 72 h later for assessment of neuropathology. Un-operated twin fetuses were used as age-matched non-UCO controls (n = 8).

In UCO + saline fetuses, microglial and apoptotic cell density in the subcortical and periventricular white matter, caudate nucleus and hippocampus was greater than that in age-matched controls; oxidative stress was elevated in the subcortical and periventricular white matter and caudate nucleus compared to that in age-matched controls. In UCO + dopamine fetuses microglial density and oxidative stress in the cerebral white matter and caudate nucleus were not different to that of age-matched controls. Apoptotic cell death was decreased in the cerebral white matter of UCO + dopamine brains, relative to UCO + saline brains.

We conclude that pretreatment with dopamine does not exacerbate hypoxia-induced injury in the immature brain and may be neuroprotective because it led to decreased apoptosis, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in the cerebral white matter and decreased neuroinflammation in the caudate nucleus.

AB  - Abstract
Manganese (Mn) intoxication is associated with neurological dysfunctions collectively known as Parkinsonism or Manganism. Like in Parkinson’s disease, Manganism is associated with motor disturbances, together with non-motor symptoms including cognitive and neuropsychiatric deficits. Although sleep dysfunctions are commonly reported among workers exposed to Mn, their underlying pathophysiology remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the rest-activity rhythms in rats treated daily with MnCl2 (10 mg/kg, i.p) for 5 weeks. Locomotor activity was assessed under a light–dark (LD) cycle, constant darkness (DD) and during adjustment to 6 h shifts of the LD cycle. In LD conditions, Mn-treated rats exhibited a more fragmented and less stable rest-activity rhythm in addition to a reduction in the total 24-h amount of locomotor activity as well as in the activity confined to the active dark phase of the LD. Consequently, a significant decrease in the amplitude of the rest-activity rhythm was observed. These disturbances were displayed during and after Mn treatment. Furthermore, after the 6-h phase advance of the LD cycle, Mn-treated rats failed to re-adjust accurately their behavioral activity to the new shifted LD cycle. Upon release from LD into DD, Mn-treated rats expressed a normal and stable free-running period of their rest-activity rhythm (23.92 ± 0.07 h in Mn group vs. 24.01 ± 0.04 h in control rats). However, their rest-activity rhythm remained highly fragmented and less stable. Our results provide the first evidence that chronic Mn intoxication leads to impairment of rest-activity rhythms in addition to the motor and non-motor disturbances reported in Manganism.

AB  - Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a reactive oxygen species, is an important signaling molecule for synaptic and neuronal activity in the central nervous system; it is produced excessively in brain ischemia and spinal cord injury. Although H2O2-mediated modulations of synaptic transmission have been reported in ventral horn (VH) neurons of the rat spinal cord, the effects of H2O2 on neuronal excitability and membrane properties remain poorly understood. Accordingly, the present study investigated such effects using a whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The bath-application of H2O2 decreased neuronal excitability accompanied by decreased input resistance, firing frequency, and action potential amplitude and by increased rheobase. These H2O2-mediated changes were induced by activation of extrasynaptic, but not synaptic, GABAA receptors. Indeed, GABAergic tonic currents were enhanced by H2O2. On the other hand, the amplitude of medium and slow afterhyperpolarization (mAHP and sAHP), which plays important roles in controlling neuronal excitability and is mediated by small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels, was significantly decreased by H2O2. When extrasynaptic GABAA receptors were completely blocked, these decreases of mAHP and sAHP persisted, and H2O2 increased excitability, suggesting that H2O2 per se might have the potential to increase neuronal excitability via decreased SK channel conductance. These findings indicate that activating extrasynaptic GABAA receptors or SK channels may attenuate acute neuronal damage caused by H2O2-induced hyperexcitability and therefore represent a novel therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of H2O2-induced motor neuron disorders.

Adult brain plasticity can be investigated using reversible methods that remove afferent innervation but allow return of sensory input. Repeated intranasal irrigation with Triton X-100 in adult zebrafish diminishes innervation to the olfactory bulb, resulting in a number of alterations in bulb structure and function, and cessation of the treatment allows for reinnervation and recovery. Using bromodeoxyuridine, Hu, and caspase-3 immunoreactivity we examined cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival under conditions of acute and chronic deafferentation and reafferentation. Cell proliferation within the olfactory bulb was not influenced by acute or chronic deafferentation or reafferentation, but cell fate (including differentiation, migration, and/or survival of newly formed cells) was affected. We found that chronic deafferentation caused a bilateral increase in the number of newly formed cells that migrated into the bulb, although the amount of cell death of these new cells was significantly increased compared to untreated fish. Reafferentation also increased the number of newly formed cells migrating into both bulbs, suggesting that the deafferentation effect on cell fate was maintained. Reafferentation resulted in a decrease in newly formed cells that became neurons and, although death of newly formed cells was not altered from control levels, survival was reduced in relation to that seen in chronically deafferented fish. The potential effect of age on cell genesis was also examined. While the amount of cell migration into the olfactory bulbs was not affected by fish age, more of the newly formed cells became neurons in older fish. Younger fish displayed more cell death under conditions of chronic deafferentation. In sum, our results show that reversible deafferentation affects several aspects of cell fate, including cell differentiation, migration, and survival, and age of the fish influences the response to deafferentation.

Migraine affects predominantly women. Furthermore, epidemiological studies suggest that obesity is a risk factor for migraine and this association is influenced by sex. However, the biological basis for this bias is unclear. To address this issue, we assessed light avoidant behavior, a surrogate of photophobia, in female C57BL/6J mice fed regular diet (RD) or high-fat diet (HFD, 60% kcal from fat). We first assessed sex differences in basal photophobia in 20–25-week-old mice and found that both obese and lean females spent significantly less time in light than their male counterparts. Next, we assessed photophobia evoked by trigeminal stimulation with intradermal capsaicin. Females at 20–25 weeks of age did not display capsaicin-evoked photophobic behavior unless they had diet-induced obesity. When we tested 8–11-week-old females to determine if the diet alone could be responsible for this effect, we found that both HFD and RD 8–11-week-old females exhibit capsaicin-evoked photophobic behavior. This is in contrast to what we have previously shown in males and indicates a sex difference in the photophobic behavior of mice. Comparison of 20–25-week-old RD mice with 8–11-week-old RD mice suggests that age or age-related weight gain may contribute to capsaicin-evoked photophobic behavior in males, but not in females. These findings suggest that obesity exacerbates photophobia in both sexes, but additional work is needed to understand the sex- and age-specific mechanisms that may contribute to photophobia and trigeminal pain.

AB  - Abstract
Songbirds, like humans, learn vocalizations and their striatum recruits new neurons in adulthood. Injury in striatal vocal nucleus Area X, involved in song learning and production in songbirds, is followed by massive regeneration. The newborn neurons arise from the subventricular zone (SVZ) rich in dopamine D3 receptors (D3Rs). The aim of this study was to investigate whether the D3Rs affect the rate of neuronal recovery in Area X. Male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) received bilateral neurotoxic lesion of Area X and were implanted with osmotic minipumps containing D3R agonist 7-OH-DPAT, antagonist U99194, or saline. Treatment with 7-OH-DPAT but not U99194 led to significant reduction of lesion size and increased numbers of migrating neuroblasts and newborn cells in the Area X. These cells were detected in the lesion border as well as the lesion center. Lesion also led to increased mRNA expression of the D3Rs in the neurogenic SVZ and in the nucleus robustus arcopallialis (RA) involved in song production. Moreover, lesion alone prolonged the song duration and this may be facilitated by D3Rs in RA. Parallel lesion and stimulation of D3Rs prolonged it even more, while blocking of D3Rs abolished the lesion-induced effect. These data suggest that D3R stimulation after striatal injury accelerates the striatal recovery and can cause behavioral alterations.

AB  - Abstract
Hindbrain dorsal vagal complex A2 noradrenergic signaling represses the pre-ovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge in response to energy deficiency. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia augments A2 neuron adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity and estrogen receptor-beta (ERβ) expression, coincident with LH surge suppression. We hypothesized that ERβ is critical for hypoglycemia-associated patterns of LH secretion and norepinephrine (NE) activity in key reproduction-relevant forebrain structures. The neural mechanisms responsible for tight coupling of systemic energy balance and procreation remain unclear; here, we investigated whether ERβ-dependent hindbrain signals also control glucose counter-regulatory responses to hypoglycemia. Gonadal steroid-primed ovariectomized female rats were pretreated by caudal fourth ventricular administration of the ERβ antagonist 4-[2-phenyl-5,7-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-3-yl]phenol (PHTPP) or vehicle before insulin injection at LH surge onset. Western blot analysis of laser-microdissected A2 neurons revealed hypoglycemic intensification of AMPK activity and dopamine-β-hydroxylase protein expression; the latter response was attenuated by PHTPP pretreatment. PHTPP regularized LH release, but not preoptic GnRH-I precursor protein expression in insulin-injected rats, and reversed hypoglycemic stimulation of glucagon and corticosterone secretion. Hypoglycemia caused PHTPP-reversible changes in NE and prepro-kisspeptin protein content in the hypothalamic arcuate (ARH), but not anteroventral periventricular nucleus. Results provide novel evidence for ERβ-dependent caudal hindbrain regulation of LH and counter-regulatory hormone secretion during hypoglycemia. Observed inhibition of LH likely involves mechanisms at the axon terminal that impede GnRH neurotransmission. Data also show that caudal hindbrain ERβ exerts site-specific control of NE activity in forebrain projection sites during hypoglycemia, including the ARH where prepro-kisspeptin may be a target of that signaling.

AB  - Abstract
Motor neuron (MN) diseases are characterized by progressive cell degeneration, and excitotoxicity has been postulated as a causal factor. Using two experimental procedures for inducing excitotoxic spinal MN degeneration in vivo, by acute and chronic overactivation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleacetic acid (AMPA) receptors, we characterized the time course of the neuropathological changes. Electron transmission microscopy showed that acute AMPA perfusion by microdialysis caused MN swelling 1.5 h after surgery and lysis with membrane rupture as early as 3 h; no cleaved caspase 3 was detected by immunochemistry. Chronic AMPA infusion by osmotic minipumps induced a slow degeneration process along 5 days, characterized by progressive changes: endoplasmic reticulum swelling, vacuolization of cytoplasm, vacuole fusion and cell membrane rupture. Quantification of these ultrastructural alterations showed that the increase of vacuolated area was at the expense of the nuclear area. Caspase 3 cleavage was observed since the first day of AMPA infusion. We conclude that acute AMPA-induced excitotoxicity induces MN loss by necrosis, while the progress of degeneration induced by chronic infusion is slow, starting with an early apoptotic process followed by necrosis. In both the acute and chronic procedures a correlation could be established between the loss of MN by necrosis, but not by caspase 3-linked apoptosis, and severe motor deficits and hindlimb paralysis. Our findings are relevant for understanding the mechanisms of neuron death in degenerative diseases and thus for the design of pharmacological therapeutic strategies.

l-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) is the therapeutic gold standard in Parkinson’s disease. However, most patients develop debilitating abnormal involuntary movements termed l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) as therapy-complicating side effects. The underlying mechanisms of LID pathogenesis are still not fully understood. Recent evidence suggests an involvement of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein-expressing neurons, as they are capable of endogenously producing l-DOPA and possibly dopamine. The aim of this study was to elucidate changes of TH transcription in the striatum and nucleus accumbens that occur under experimental conditions of LID.

Mice with a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesion of the medial forebrain bundle were treated daily with l-DOPA for 15 days to provoke dyskinesia. In situ hybridization analysis revealed a significant numerical decrease of TH mRNA-positive neurons in the striatum and nucleus accumbens of mice not exhibiting LID, whereas dyskinetic animals failed to show this reduction of TH transcription. Interestingly, similar changes were observed in intact non-deafferentiated striata, demonstrating an l-DOPA-responsive transcriptional TH regulation independently from nigrostriatal lesion severity.

Consolidation with our previous study on TH protein level (Keber et al., 2015) impressively highlights that LID is associated with both a deficient downregulation of TH transcription and an excessive translation of TH protein in intrastriatal neurons. As TH protein levels in comparison to mRNA levels showed a stronger correlation with development and severity of LID, antidyskinetic treatment strategies should focus on translational and posttranslational modulations of TH as a promising target.

AB  - Abstract
For years, the prevailing hypothesis for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) has proposed a mechanism by which deposition of amyloid-beta (Aβ) in the brain is independent of tau-pathologies and cognitive decline. However, despite extensive research on the disease, the mechanisms underlying the etiology of tau-pathology remain unknown. Previous research in our lab has shown that imatinib methanesulfonate (IM) blocks the peripheral production of Aβ in response to LPS, thereby preventing the buildup of Aβ in the hippocampus, and rescuing the cognitive dysfunction that normally follows. The present study aimed to examine the link between Aβ and tau following inflammation, and to expand our understanding of how IM affects AD pathology. Specifically, we hypothesized that the IM-mediated inhibition of Aβ production following inflammation would successfully protect against the hyperphosphorylation of tau (ptau). Here we show that 7 days of LPS treatment in male C57BL/6 J mice, which normally produces elevations in peripheral and central Aβ, also produces hyperphosphorylation of tau. However, just as pre-treatment and concurrent treatment with IM blocks Aβ production, it also blocks the phosphorylation of tau. In addition, 7 days of LPS-induced inflammation and Aβ production also leads to elevated total tau protein expression. Our results may provide support for the hypothesis that enhanced expression of tau following LPS administration is a protective measure by hippocampal neurons to compensate for the loss of the microtubule-stabilizing protein due to phosphorylation. More importantly, our results support the hypothesis that blocking the production of Aβ that follows inflammation also leads to reduced tau phosphorylation, lending credence to a model in which Aβ initiates tau phosphorylation.

AB  - Abstract
P2Y2 is a member of the P2Y family of G protein-coupled nucleotide receptors that is widely co-expressed with TRPV1 in peripheral sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia. To characterize P2Y2 function in cutaneous afferents, intracellular recordings from mouse sensory neurons were made using an ex vivo preparation in which hindlimb skin, saphenous nerve, dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord are dissected intact. The peripheral response properties of individual cutaneous C-fibers were analyzed using digitally controlled mechanical and thermal stimuli in male P2Y2+/+ and P2Y2−/− mice. Selected sensory neurons were labeled with Neurobiotin and further characterized by immunohistochemistry. In wildtype preparations, C-fibers responding to both mechanical and thermal stimuli (CMH or CMHC) preferentially bound the lectin marker IB4 and were always immunonegative for TRPV1. Conversely, cells that fired robustly to noxious heat, but were insensitive to mechanical stimuli, were TRPV1-positive and IB4-negative. P2Y2 gene deletion resulted in reduced firing by TRPV1-negative CMH fibers to a range of heat stimuli. However, we also identified an atypical population of IB4-negative, TRPV1-positive CMH fibers. Compared to wildtype CMH fibers, these TRPV1-positive neurons exhibited lower firing rates in response to mechanical stimulation, but had increased firing to noxious heat (43–51 °C). Collectively, these results demonstrate that P2Y2 contributes to response properties of cutaneous afferents, as P2Y2 deletion reduces responsiveness of conventional unmyelinated polymodal afferents to heat and appears to result in the acquisition of mechanical responsiveness in a subset of TRPV1-expressing afferents.

AB  - Abstract
Adult hippocampal neurogenesis can be modulated by various physiological and pathological conditions, including stress, affective disorders, and several neurological conditions. Given the proposed role of this form of structural plasticity in the functioning of the hippocampus (namely learning and memory and affective behaviors), it is believed that alterations in hippocampal neurogenesis might underlie some of the behavioral deficits associated with these psychiatric and neurological conditions. Thus, the search for compounds that can reverse these deficits with minimal side effects has become a recognized priority. In the present study we tested the pro-neurogenic effects of isoxazole 9 (Isx-9), a small synthetic molecule that has been recently identified through the screening of chemical libraries in stem cell-based assays. We found that administration of Isx-9 for 14 days was able to potentiate cell proliferation and increase the number of immature neurons in the hippocampal DG of adult rats. In addition, Isx-9 treatment was able to completely reverse the marked reduction in these initial stages of the neurogenic process observed in vehicle-treated animals (which were submitted to repeated handling and exposure to daily intraperitoneal injections). Based on these results, we recommend that future neurogenesis studies that require repeated handling and manipulation of animals should include a naïve (non-manipulated) control to determine the baseline levels of hippocampal cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Overall, these findings demonstrate that Isx-9 is a promising synthetic compound for the mitigation of stress-induced deficits in adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Future studies are thus warranted to evaluate the pro-neurogenic properties of Isx-9 in animal models of affective and neurological disorders associated with impaired hippocampal structural plasticity.

AB  - Abstract
The rat has long been considered an important model system for studying neural mechanisms of auditory perception and learning, and particularly mechanisms involving auditory thalamo-cortical processing. However, the functional topography of the auditory thalamus, or medial geniculate body (MGB) has not yet been fully characterized in the rat, and the anatomically-defined features of field-specific, layer-specific and tonotopic thalamo-cortical projections have never been confirmed electrophysiologically. In the present study, we have established a novel technique for recording simultaneously from a surface microelectrode array on the auditory cortex, and a depth electrode array across auditory cortical layers and within the MGB, and characterized the rat MGB and thalamo-cortical projections under isoflurane anesthesia. We revealed that the ventral division of the MGB (MGv) exhibited a low–high–low CF gradient and long-short-long latency gradient along the dorsolateral-to-ventromedial axis, suggesting that the rat MGv is divided into two subdivisions. We also demonstrated that microstimulation in the MGv elicited cortical activation in layer-specific, region-specific and tonotopically organized manners. To our knowledge, the present study has provided the first and most compelling electrophysiological confirmation of the anatomical organization of the primary thalamo-cortical pathway in the rat, setting the groundwork for further investigation.

AB  - Abstract
α2 adrenoreceptors (α2-ARs) play a key role in the control of noradrenaline and dopamine release in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Here, using UV-laser microdissection-based quantitative mRNA expression in individual neurons we show that in hTH-GFP rats, a transgenic line exhibiting intense and specific fluorescence in dopaminergic (DA) neurons, α2A adrenoreceptor (α2A-AR) mRNA is expressed at high and low levels in DA cells in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra compacta (SNc), respectively. Confocal microscopy fluorescence immunohistochemistry revealed that α2A-AR immunoreactivity colocalized with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in nearly all DA cells in the VTA and SNc, both in hTH-GFP rats and their wild-type Sprague–Dawley (SD) counterparts. α2A-AR immunoreactivity was also found in DA axonal projections to the mPFC and dorsal caudate in the hTH-GFP and in the anterogradely labeled DA axonal projections from VTA to mPFC in SD rats. Importantly, the α2A-AR immunoreactivity localized in the DA cells of VTA and in their fibers in the mPFC was much higher than that in DA cells of SNc and their fibers in dorsal caudate, respectively.

The finding that α2A-ARs are highly expressed in the cell bodies and axons of mesoprefrontal dopaminergic neurons provides a morphological basis to the vast functional evidence that somatodendritic and nerve-terminal α2A-AR receptors control dopaminergic activity and dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex. This finding raises the question whether α2A-ARs might function as autoreceptors in the mesoprefrontal dopaminergic neurons, replacing the lack of D2 autoreceptors.

AB  - Abstract
Abacus-based mental calculation (AMC) activates the frontoparietal areas largely overlapping with the working memory (WM) network. Given the critical role of WM in cognition, how to improve WM capability has attracted intensive attention in past years. However, it is still unclear whether WM could be enhanced by AMC training. The current research thus explored the impact of AMC training on verbal and visuospatial WM, as well as the underlying neural basis. Participants were randomly assigned to an abacus group and a control group. Their verbal WM was evaluated by digit/letter memory span (DMS/LMS) tests, and visuospatial WM was assessed by a visuospatial n-back task. Neural activity during the n-back task was examined using functional MRI. Our results showed reliable improvements of both verbal and visuospatial WM in the abacus group after 20-day AMC training but not in the control. In addition, the n-back task-induced activations in the right frontoparietal circuitry and left occipitotemporal junction (OTJ) declined as a result of training. Notably, the decreases in activity were positively correlated with performance gains across trained participants. These results suggest AMC training not only improves calculating skills but also have the potential to promote individuals’ WM capabilities, which is associated with the functional plasticity of the common neural substrates.

AB  - Abstract
Preconditioning can induce a cascade of cellular events leading to neuroprotection against subsequent brain insults. In this study, we investigated the chronic effects of hypoxic preconditioning on spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS), neuronal death, and spatial memory performance in rats subjected to pilocarpine (Pilo)-induced status epilepticus (SE). Rats underwent a short hypoxic episode (7% O2 + 93% N2; 30 min on two consecutive days) preceding a 4-h SE (HSE group). Control groups were rats submitted to SE only (SE), rats subjected to hypoxia only (H) or normoxia-saline (C). Animals were monitored for the occurrence of SRS, and spatial memory performance was evaluated in the radial-arm maze. Hippocampal sections were analyzed for cell death and mossy fiber sprouting at 1 or 60 days after SE. Compared to SE group, HSE had increased SE latency, reduced number of rats with SRS, reduced mossy fiber sprouting at 60 days, and reduced cell death in the hilus and the CA3 region 1 and 60 days after SE. Additionally, HSE rats had better spatial memory performance than SE rats. Our findings indicated that short hypoxic preconditioning preceding SE promotes long-lasting protective effects on neuron survival and spatial memory.

In an attempt to improve current understanding of risk factors that influence individual susceptibility to poor outcomes following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) or concussion, this project investigated whether modifications to paternal experiences (Advanced Age (AA) or High-Fat Diet (HFD)) affected offspring susceptibility to behavioral symptomology and changes in gene expression following pediatric concussion in a rodent model. The study demonstrated that paternal treatment prior to conception altered behavioral outcomes and molecular characterization of offspring. Offspring of AA fathers demonstrated abnormal behavioral performance when compared to offspring of control fathers. Similarly, paternal HFD altered pathophysiological outcomes for offspring, contributing to the heterogeneity in post-concussion syndrome. Additionally, this study provided insight into the mechanisms that mediate non-genetic paternal inheritance. Paternal treatment and the mTBI significantly influenced expression of a majority of the genes under examination in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens, with changes being dependent upon sex and the brain region examined. These epigenetic changes may have contributed to the differences in offspring susceptibility to concussion.

AB  - Abstract
Iron-overload can cause cognitive impairment due to blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and brain mitochondrial dysfunction. Although deferiprone (DFP) has been shown to exert neuroprotection, the head-to-head comparison among iron chelators used clinically on brain iron-overload has not been investigated. Moreover, since antioxidant has been shown to be beneficial in iron-overload condition, its combined effect with iron chelator has not been tested. Therefore, the hypothesis is that all chelators provide neuroprotection under iron-overload condition, and that a combination of an iron chelator with an antioxidant has greater efficacy than monotherapy. Male Wistar rats (n = 42) were assigned to receive a normal diet (ND) or a high-iron diet (HFe) for 4 months. At the 2nd month, HFe-fed rats were treated with a vehicle, deferoxamine (DFO), DFP, deferasirox (DFX), n-acetyl cysteine (NAC) or a combination of DFP with NAC, while ND-fed rats received vehicle. At the end of the experiment, rats were decapitated and brains were removed to determine brain iron level and deposition, brain mitochondrial function, BBB protein expression, brain mitochondrial dynamic, brain apoptosis, tau-hyperphosphorylation, amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation and dendritic spine density. The results showed that iron-overload induced BBB breakdown, brain iron accumulation, brain mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired brain mitochondrial dynamics, tau-hyperphosphorylation, Aβ accumulation and dendritic spine reduction. All treatments, except DFX, attenuated these impairments. Moreover, combined therapy provided a greater efficacy than monotherapy. These findings suggested that iron-overload induced brain iron toxicity and a combination of an iron chelator with an antioxidant provided a greatest efficacy for neuroprotection than monotherapy.

AB  - Abstract
Amitriptyline (AMI), a commonly prescribed tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) to parkinsonian patients, specifically showed a significant delay in dopaminergic therapy initiation and improvement in motor disability in parkinsonian patients. Moreover, it was recently shown that AMI has neuroprotective properties; however, the mechanisms underlying this effect in Parkinson’s disease (PD) are not fully understood. The current study aimed to investigate the possible neuroprotective mechanisms afforded by AMI in the rotenone model of PD and to assess whether another TCA member, imipramine (IMI), shows a corresponding effect. Rats were allocated into seven groups. Four groups were given either saline, dimethyl sulfoxide, AMI or IMI. Three rotenone groups were either untreated or treated with AMI or IMI. Rats receiving rotenone exhibited motor impairment in open field and rotarod tests. Additionally, immunohistochemical examination revealed dopaminergic neuronal damage in substantia nigra. Besides, striatal monoamines and brain derived neurotrophic factor levels were declined. Furthermore, oxidative stress, microglial activation and inflammation were evident in the striata. Pretreatment of rotenone groups with AMI or IMI prevented rotenone-induced neuronal degeneration and increased striatal dopamine level with motor recovery. These effects were accompanied by restoring striatal monoamines and brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, as well as reducing oxidative damage, microglial activation and expression of proinflammatory cytokines and inducible nitric oxide synthase. The present results suggest that modulation of noradrenaline and serotonin levels, up-regulation of neurotrophin, inhibition of glial activation, anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities could serve as important mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of the used drugs in the rotenone model of PD.

AB  - Abstract
A loud auditory stimulus (LAS) presented simultaneously with a visual imperative stimulus can reduce reaction time (RT) by automatically triggering a movement prepared in the brain and has been used to investigate a movement preparation. It is still under debate whether or not a response is prepared in advance in RT tasks involving choice responses. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the preparatory state of anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) during a choice reaction step initiation. Thirteen young adults were asked to step forward in response to a visual imperative stimulus in two choice stepping conditions: (i) the responding side is not known and must be selected and (ii) the responding side is known but whether to initiate or inhibit a step response must be selected. LAS was presented randomly and simultaneously with the visual imperative stimulus. LAS significantly increased the occurrence rates of inappropriately initiated APAs while reducing the RTs of correct and incorrect trials in both task conditions, demonstrating that LAS triggered the prepared APA automatically. This observation suggests that APAs are prepared in advance and withheld from release until the appropriate timing during a choice reaction step initiation. The preparatory activity of APAs might be modulated by the inhibitory activity required by the choice tasks. The preparation strategy may be chosen for fast responses and is judged most suitable to comply with the tasks because inappropriately initiated APAs can be corrected without making complete stepping errors.

AB  - Abstract
Leptin is an important hormone that regulates food intake and energy homeostasis by acting on central and peripheral targets. In the gustatory system, leptin is known to selectively suppress sweet responses by inhibiting the activation of sweet sensitive taste cells. Sweet taste receptor (T1R2 + T1R3) is also expressed in gut enteroendocrine cells and contributes to nutrient sensing, hormone release and glucose absorption. Because of the similarities in expression patterns between enteroendocrine and taste receptor cells, we hypothesized that they may also share similar mechanisms used to modify/regulate the sweet responsiveness of these cells by leptin. Here, we used mouse enteroendocrine cell line STC-1 and examined potential effect of leptin on Ca2+ responses of STC-1 cells to various taste compounds. Ca2+ responses to sweet compounds in STC-1 cells were suppressed by a rodent T1R3 inhibitor gurmarin, suggesting the involvement of T1R3-dependent receptors in detection of sweet compounds. Responses to sweet substances were suppressed by ⩾1 ng/ml leptin without affecting responses to bitter, umami and salty compounds. This effect was inhibited by a leptin antagonist (mutant L39A/D40A/F41A) and by ATP gated K+ (KATP) channel closer glibenclamide, suggesting that leptin affects sweet taste responses of enteroendocrine cells via activation of leptin receptor and KATP channel expressed in these cells. Moreover, leptin selectively inhibited sweet-induced but not bitter-induced glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion from STC-1 cells. These results suggest that leptin modulates sweet taste responses of enteroendocrine cells to regulate nutrient sensing, hormone release and glucose absorption in the gut.

AB  - Abstract
In experimental animal models of auditory hair cell (HC) loss, insults such as noise or ototoxic drugs often lead to secondary changes or degeneration in non-sensory cells and neural components, including reduced density of spiral ganglion neurons, demyelination of auditory nerve fibers and altered cell numbers and innervation patterns in the cochlear nucleus (CN). However, it is not clear whether loss of HCs alone leads to secondary degeneration in these neural components of the auditory pathway. To elucidate this issue, we investigated changes of central components after cochlear insults specific to HCs using diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) mice expressing DTR only in HCs and exhibiting complete HC loss when injected with diphtheria toxin (DT). We showed that DT-induced HC ablation has no significant impacts on the survival of auditory neurons, central synaptic terminals, and myelin, despite complete HC loss and profound deafness. In contrast, noise exposure induced significant changes in synapses, myelin and CN organization even without loss of inner HCs. We observed a decrease of neuronal size in the auditory pathway, including peripheral axons, spiral ganglion neurons, and CN neurons, likely due to loss of input from the cochlea. Taken together, selective HC ablation and noise exposure showed different patterns of pathology in the auditory pathway and the presence of HCs is not essential for the maintenance of central synaptic connectivity and myelination.

AB  - Abstract
Hypoxic circumstances result in functional and structural impairments of the brain. Oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) on hippocampal slices is a technique widely used to investigate the consequences of ischemic stroke and the potential neuroprotective effects of different drugs. Acetyl-l-carnitine (ALC) is a naturally occurring substance in the body, and it can therefore be administered safely even in relatively high doses. In previous experiments, ALC pretreatment proved to be effective against global hypoperfusion. In the present study, we investigated whether ALC can be protective in an OGD model. We are not aware of any earlier study in which the long-term potentiation (LTP) function on hippocampal slices was measured after OGD. Therefore, we set out to determine whether an effective ALC concentration has an effect on synaptic plasticity after OGD in the hippocampal CA1 subfield of rats. A further aim was to investigate the mechanism underlying the protective effect of this compound. The experiments revealed that ALC is neuroprotective against OGD in a dose-dependent manner, which is manifested not only in the regeneration of the impaired synaptic transmission after the OGD, but also in the inducibility and stability of the LTP. In the case of the most effective concentration of ALC (500 μM), use of a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (LY294002) revealed that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway has a key role in the restoration of the synaptic transmission and plasticity reached by ALC treatment.

AB  - Abstract
Previous work on Parkinson’s disease (PD) has indicated a predominantly afferent coupling between affected arm muscle activity and electrophysiological activity within the subthalamic nucleus (STN). So far, no information is available indicating which frequency components drive the afferent information flow in PD patients. Non-directional coupling e.g. by measuring coherence is primarily established in the beta band as well as at tremor frequency. Based on previous evidence it is likely that different subtypes of the disease are associated with different connectivity patterns. Therefore, we determined coherence and causality between local field potentials (LFPs) in the STN and surface electromyograms (EMGs) from the contralateral arm in 18 akinetic-rigid (AR) PD patients and 8 tremor-dominant (TD) PD patients. During the intraoperative recording, patients were asked to lift their forearm contralateral to the recording side. Significantly more afferent connections were detected for the TD patients for tremor-periods and non-tremor-periods combined as well as for only tremor periods. Within the STN 74% and 63% of the afferent connections are associated with coherence from 4–8 Hz and 8–12 Hz, respectively. However, when considering only tremor-periods significantly more afferent than efferent connections were associated with coherence from 12 to 20 Hz across all recording heights. No difference between efferent and afferent connections is seen in the frequency range from 4 to 12 Hz for all recording heights. For the AR patients, no significant difference in afferent and efferent connections within the STN was found for the different frequency bands. Still, for the AR patients dorsal of the STN significantly more afferent than efferent connections were associated with coherence in the frequency range from 12 to 16 Hz. These results provide further evidence for the differential pathological oscillations and pathways present in AR and TD Parkinson patients.

AB  - Abstract
Sigma receptor (σR), a unique receptor family, is classified into three subtypes: σR1, σR2 and σR3. It was previously shown that σR1 activation induced by 1 μM SKF10047 (SKF) suppressed N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated responses of rat retinal ganglion cells (GCs) and the suppression was mediated by a distinct Ca2+-dependent phospholipase C (PLC)–protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. In the present work, using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques in rat retinal slice preparations, we further demonstrate that SKF of higher dosage (50 μM) significantly suppressed AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated light-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (L-EPSCs) of retinal ON-type GCs (ON GCs), and the effect was reversed by the σR1 antagonist BD1047, suggesting the involvement of σR1. The SKF (50 μM) effect was unlikely due to a change in glutamate release from bipolar cells, as suggested by the unaltered paired-pulse ratio (PPR) of AMPAR-mediated EPSCs of ON GCs. SKF (50 μM) did not change L-EPSCs of ON GCs when the G protein inhibitor GDP-β-S or the protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor KT5823 was intracellularly infused. Calcium imaging further revealed that SKF (50 μM) did not change intracellular calcium concentration in GCs and persisted to suppress L-EPSCs when intracellular calcium was chelated by BAPTA. The SKF (50 μM) effect was intact when protein kinase A (PKA) and phosphatidylinostiol (PI)-PLC signaling pathways were both blocked. We conclude that the SKF (50 μM) effect is Ca2+-independent, PKG-dependent, but not involving PKA, PI-PLC pathways.

AB  - Abstract
Stress-induced modifications of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are believed to contribute to the onset of mood disorders, such as depression and anxiety, which are more prevalent in women. In depression, the PFC is hypoactive; however the origin of this hypoactivity remains unclear. Possibly, stress could impact the prefrontal GABAergic inhibitory system that, as a result, impairs the functioning of downstream limbic structures controlling emotions. Preclinical evidence indicates that the female PFC is more sensitive to the effects of stress. These findings suggest that exposure to stress could lead to sex-specific alterations in prefrontal GABAergic signaling, which contribute to sex-specific abnormal functioning of limbic regions. These limbic changes could promote the onset of depressive and anxiety behaviors in a sex-specific manner, providing a possible mechanism mediating sex differences in the clinical presentation of stress-related mood disorders. We addressed this hypothesis using a mouse model of stress-induced depressive-like behaviors: the unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) paradigm. We observed changes in prefrontal GABAergic signaling after exposure to UCMS most predominantly in females. Increased parvalbumin (PV) expression and decreased prefrontal neuronal activity were correlated in females with severe emotionality deficit following UCMS, and with altered activity of the amygdala. In males, small changes in emotionality following UCMS were associated with minor changes in prefrontal PV expression, and with hypoactivity of the nucleus accumbens. Our data suggest that prefrontal hypoactivity observed in stress-related mood disorders could result from stress-induced increases in PV expression, particularly in females. This increased vulnerability of the female prefrontal PV system to stress could underlie sex differences in the prevalence and symptomatology of stress-related mood disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive impairment. Currently, there is less knowledge of the involvement of the peripheral biofluid/organ in AD, compared with the central nervous system. In addition, with reported high morbidity in women in particular, it has become very important to explore whether gender difference in the peripheral metabolome is associated with AD. Here, we investigated metabolic responses of both plasma and liver tissues using an APP/PS1 double mutant transgenic mouse model with NMR spectroscopy, as well as analysis from serum biochemistry and histological staining. Fatty acid composition from plasma and liver extracts was analyzed using GC-FID/MS. We found clear gender differences in AD transgenic mice when compared with their wild-type counterparts. Female AD mice displayed more intensive responses, which were highlighted by higher levels of lipids, 3-hydroxybutyrate and nucleotide-related metabolites, together with lower levels of glucose. These observations indicate that AD induces oxidative stress and impairs cellular energy metabolism in peripheral organs. Disturbances in AD male mice were milder with depletion of monounsaturated fatty acids. We also observed a higher activity of delta-6-desaturate and suppressed activity of delta-5-desaturate in female mice, whereas inhibited stearoyl-CoA-desaturase in male mice suggested that AD induced by the double mutant genes results in different fatty acids catabolism depending on gender. Our results provide metabolic clues into the peripheral biofluid/organs involved in AD, and we propose that a gender-specific scheme for AD treatment in men and women may be required.

AB  - Abstract
The dorsomedial striatum (DMS) has been implicated in the acquisition of reward representations, a proposal leading to the hypothesis that it should play a role in situations involving reward loss. We report the results of an experiment in which the effects of DMS excitotoxic lesions were tested in consummatory successive negative contrast (reward devaluation), autoshaping training with partial vs. continuous reinforcement (reward uncertainty), and appetitive extinction (reward omission). Animals with DMS lesions exhibited reduced lever pressing responding, but enhanced goal entries, during partial reinforcement training in autoshaping. However, they showed normal negative contrast, acquisition under continuous reinforcement (CR), appetitive extinction, and response facilitation in early extinction trials. Open-field testing also indicated normal motor behavior. Thus, DMS lesions selectively affected the behavioral adjustment to a situation involving reward uncertainty, producing a behavioral reorganization according to which goal tracking (goal entries) became predominant at the expense of sign tracking (lever pressing). This pattern of results shows that the function of the DMS in situations involving reward loss is not general, but restricted to reward uncertainty. We suggest that a nonassociative, drive-related process induced by reward uncertainty requires normal output from DMS neurons.

AB  - Abstract
Knowledge of how the head moves during locomotion is essential for understanding how locomotion is controlled by sensory systems of the head. We have analyzed head movements of the cat walking along a straight flat pathway in the darkness and light. We found that cats’ head left-right translations, and roll and yaw rotations oscillated once per stride, while fore-aft and vertical translations, and pitch rotations oscillated twice. The head reached its highest vertical positions during second half of each forelimb swing, following maxima of the shoulder/trunk by 20–90°. Nose-up rotation followed head upward translation by another 40–90° delay. The peak-to-peak amplitude of vertical translation was ∼1.5 cm and amplitude of pitch rotation was ∼3°. Amplitudes of lateral translation and roll rotation were ∼1 cm and 1.5–3°, respectively. Overall, cats’ heads were neutral in roll and 10–30° nose-down, maintaining horizontal semicircular canals and utriculi within 10° of the earth horizontal. The head longitudinal velocity was 0.5–1 m/s, maximal upward and downward linear velocities were ∼0.05 and ∼0.1 m/s, respectively, and maximal lateral velocity was ∼0.05 m/s. Maximal velocities of head pitch rotation were 20–50 °/s. During walking in light, cats stood 0.3–0.5 cm taller and held their head 0.5–2 cm higher than in darkness. Forward acceleration was 25–100% higher and peak-to-peak amplitude of head pitch oscillations was ∼20 °/s larger. We concluded that, during walking, the head of the cat is held actively. Reflexes appear to play only a partial role in determining head movement, and vision might further diminish their role.

AB  - Abstract
The role of T-type calcium channels in brain diseases such as absence epilepsy and neuropathic pain has been studied extensively. However, less is known regarding the involvement of T-type channels in cognition and behavior. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is a measure of sensorimotor gating which is a basic process whereby the brain filters incoming stimuli to enable appropriate responding in sensory rich environments. The regulation of PPI involves a network of limbic, cortical, striatal, pallidal and pontine brain areas, many of which show high levels of T-type calcium channel expression. Therefore, we tested the effects of blocking T-type calcium channels on PPI with the potent and selective T-type antagonist Z944 (0.3, 1, 3, 10 mg/kg; i.p.) in adult Wistar rats and two related strains, the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) and Non-Epileptic Control (NEC). PPI was tested using a protocol that varied prepulse intensity (3, 6, and 12 dB above background) and prepulse-pulse interval (30, 50, 80, 140 ms). Z944 decreased startle in the Wistar strain at the highest dose relative to lower doses. Z944 dose-dependently disrupted PPI in the Wistar and GAERS strains with the most potent effect observed with the higher doses. These findings suggest that T-type calcium channels contribute to normal patterns of brain activity that regulate PPI. Given that PPI is disrupted in psychiatric disorders, future experiments that test the specific brain regions involved in the regulation of PPI by T-type calcium channels may help inform therapeutic development for those suffering from sensorimotor gating impairments.

AB  - Abstract
The ability to share feelings with those of someone in pain is affected by the racial difference between the target and the onlooker. A differential empathic activation for race (DEAR effect) in favor of in-group members has been documented in the brain pain matrix. However, we are also capable of unbiased responses that manifest politically correct behaviors toward people of a different race. To address the neurofunctional signatures underlying both the DEAR effect and the manifestation of politically correct behaviors, we scanned with fMRI Caucasian participants while watching African or Caucasian actors touched by either a rubber eraser or a needle. Participants were instructed to empathize with the actors during the video presentation (stimulus phase) and to explicitly judge the pain level experienced by the actors (response phase). During the stimulus phase, we found a typical DEAR effect within the pain-matrix. This effect correlated with the level of implicit racial bias as measured by the IAT. On the other hand, during the response phase a significant out-group specific DEAR effect emerged in the prefrontal cortices. This latter effect was coupled with a revealing behavioral pattern: while the magnitude of the painful experience attributed to Caucasians and Africans was the same, our participants were significantly slower when judging the pain experience of the African actors. We propose a model that logically integrates these two contrasting forces at the neurobiological and behavioral level.

AB  - Abstract
The serine protease subtilisin induces a form of long-term depression (LTD) which is accompanied by a reduced expression of the axo-dendritic guidance molecule Unco-ordinated-5C (Unc-5C). One objective of the present work was to determine whether a loss of Unc-5C function contributed to subtilisin-induced LTD by using Unc-5C antibodies in combination with the pore-forming agents Triton X-100 (0.005%) or streptolysin O in rat hippocampal slices. In addition we have assessed the effect of subtilisin on the related dependence receptor Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) and used antibodies to this protein for functional studies. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were analyzed in rat hippocampal slices and protein extracts were used for Western blotting. Subtilisin produced a greater loss of DCC than of Unc-5C, but the antibodies had no effect on resting excitability or fEPSPs and did not modify subtilisin-induced LTD. However, antibodies to DCC but not Unc-5C did reduce the amplitude of theta-burst long-term potentiation (LTP). In addition, two inhibitors of endocytosis – dynasore and tat-gluR2(3Y) – were tested and, although the former compound had no effect on neurophysiological responses, tat-gluR2(3Y) did reduce the amplitude of subtilisin-induced LTD without affecting the expression of DCC or Unc-5C but with some loss of PostSynaptic Density Protein-95. The results support the view that the dependence receptor DCC may be involved in LTP and suggest that the endocytotic removal of a membrane protein or proteins may contribute to subtilisin-induced LTD, although it appears that neither Unc-5C nor DCC are involved in this process.

AB  - Abstract
Ischemic stroke in rodents stimulates neurogenesis in the adult brain and the proliferation of newborn neurons that migrate into the penumbra zone. The present study investigated the effect of Methylene Blue (MB) on neurogenesis and functional recovery in a photothrombotic (PT) model of ischemic stroke in rats. PT stroke model was induced by photo-activation of Rose Bengal dye in cerebral blood flow by cold fiber light. Rats received intraperitoneal injection of either MB (0.5 mg/kg/day) from day 1 to day 5 after stroke or an equal volume of saline solution as a control. Cell proliferative marker 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected twice daily (50 mg/kg) from day 2 to day 8 and animals were sacrificed on day 12 after PT induction. We report that MB significantly enhanced cell proliferation and neurogenesis, as evidenced by the increased co-localizations of BrdU/NeuN, BrdU/DCX, BrdU/MAP2 and BrdU/Ki67 in the peri-infarct zone compared with vehicle controls. MB thus effectively limited infarct volume and improved neurological deficits compared to PT control animals. The effects of MB were accompanied with an attenuated level of reactive gliosis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as elevated levels of cytochrome c oxidase activity and ATP production in peri-infarct regions. Our study provides important information that MB has the ability to promote neurogenesis and enhance the newborn-neurons’ survival in ischemic brain repair by inhibiting microenvironmental inflammation and increasing mitochondrial function.

AB  - Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposition, neurofibrillary tangles and cognitive decline. Recent pharmacologic studies have found that ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels may play a role in AD and could be a potential therapeutic target. Interestingly, these channels are found in both neurons and astrocytes. One of the hallmarks associated with AD is reactive gliosis and a change in astrocytic function has been identified in several neuropathological conditions including AD. Thus the goal of this study was to examine whether the pore-forming subunits of KATP channels, Kir6.1 and Kir6.2, are altered in the hippocampus in a cell type-specific manner of the 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD and in human AD tissue obtained from the Chinese brain bank. Specifically, in old 3xTg-AD mice, and age-matched controls, we examined glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), glutamine synthetase (GS), Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 in hippocampal region CA1 with a combination of immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC). A time point was selected when memory impairment and histopathological changes have been reported to occur in 3xTg-AD mice. In human AD and age-matched control tissue IHC experiments were performed using GFAP and Kir6.2. In the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD mice, compared to wild-type controls, Western blots showed a significant increase in GFAP indicating astrogliosis. Further, there was an increase in Kir6.2, but not Kir6.1 in the plasma membrane fraction. IHC examination of hippocampal region CA1 in 3xTg-AD sections revealed an increase in Kir6.2 immunoreactivity (IR) in astrocytes as identified by GFAP and GS. In human AD tissue similar data were obtained. There was an increase in GFAP-IR in the stratum oriens (SO) and alveus (ALV) of CA1 concomitant with an increase in Kir6.2-IR in cells with an astrocytic-like morphology. Dual immunofluorescence revealed a dramatic increase in co-localization of Kir6.2-IR and GFAP-IR. Taken together, these data demonstrate that increased Kir6.2 is seen in reactive astrocytes in old 3xTg-AD mice and human AD tissue. These changes could dramatically alter astrocytic function and subsequently contribute to AD phenotype in either a compensatory or pathophysiological manner.

AB  - Abstract
The inability to ejaculate, i.e. anejaculation, affects the vast majority of men after spinal cord injury (SCI). Ejaculation can however be obtained in approximately half of SCI men by applying extraphysiological vibratory stimulation to the penis suggesting that a spinal neural organization commanding ejaculation exists than can be activated despite disruption of cerebral connections. In the rat, a spinal generator of ejaculation (SGE) has been identified which is notably characterized by the presence of substance P (SP) receptor (neurokinin-1 receptor) onto the constituting neurons. The aim of this study was to evaluate the consequence of chronic spinal cord section and the effect of SP on the function of the rat SGE. Electrical stimulations of varying intensity were applied to SGE in anesthetized rats 4 weeks after complete transection of the thoracic spinal cord (T9) and ejaculation occurrence as well as peripheral responses, i.e. bulbospongiosus electromyogram and pressure within the seminal vesicle, were monitored. Then the effect of SP locally delivered was assessed in this experimental setting. Occurrence of ejaculation elicited by SGE stimulation, SGE excitatory threshold, and amplitude of peripheral responses were unchanged in spinalized as compared to spinally intact rats. In spinalized rats, SP triggered ejaculation upon intraspinal delivery into the SGE area and decreased the SGE stimulation intensity provoking ejaculation after intrathecal administration indicating a decrease in SGE excitatory threshold. The pro-ejaculatory inducing and facilitating effects of SP were reversed by the selective neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist RP67580. It was concluded that chronic spinalization has no significant impact on SGE functioning and SP exerts a pro-ejaculatory role at the SGE level, opening new avenues for the treatment of anejaculation in SCI men.

AB  - Abstract
Currently available evidence indicates that neurons containing melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) in the lateral hypothalamus are critical modulators of sleep-wakefulness, but their precise role in this function is not clear. Studies employing optogenetic stimulation of MCH neurons have yielded inconsistent results, presumably due to differences in the optogenetic stimulation protocols, which do not approximate normal patterns of cell firing. In order to resolve this discrepancy, we (1) selectively activated the MCH neurons using a chemogenetic approach (Cre-dependent hM3Dq expression) and (2) selectively destroyed MCH neurons using a genetically targeted diphtheria toxin deletion method, and studied the changes in sleep–wake in mice. Our results indicate that selective activation of MCH neurons causes specific increases in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep without altering wake or non-REM (NREM) sleep. On the other hand, selective deletions of MCH neurons altered the diurnal rhythm of wake and REM sleep without altering their total amounts. These results indicate that activation of MCH neurons primarily drives REM sleep and their presence may be necessary for normal expression of diurnal variation of REM sleep and wake.

AB  - Abstract
In the normal cerebellum, Purkinje cells (PCs) are generated in a zone along the ventricular surface, migrate radially, and align to form a single-cell layer. However, in mice lacking the secreted protein Reelin or its downstream adaptor protein Dab1, the majority of PCs are located ectopically in the deep cerebellar mass. Nonetheless, how Reelin regulates migration and alignment of PCs remains incompletely understood. Reelin has a highly-conserved C-terminal region (CTR), which is required for its full activity. Here, we report an abnormality of the cerebellum in Reelin CTR-lacking knock-in (ΔC-KI) mice. In the ΔC-KI mice, cerebellar formation was largely normal, but some PCs in selected regions were found to be located ectopically and to frequently form clusters. Ectopic PCs contained a higher amount of Dab1 protein and functional Reelin receptors, including mainly very low-density lipoprotein receptor than correctly-aligned PCs. Decreasing Dab1 gene dosage exacerbated mislocalization of PCs and the cerebellar structure in Reelin ΔC-KI mice. These results indicate that ectopic PCs in ΔC-KI mice failed to receive sufficient Reelin signaling en route to their final destinations. Further, we also found that Reelin protein with intact CTR binds preferentially to PCs. Thus, it was suggested that the extent or quality of Reelin/Dab1 signaling that PCs require for correct positioning vary and that Reelin with intact CTR is required for that of a certain subset of PCs.

AB  - Abstract
Stress vulnerability could influence the treatment response to anxiety associated with abrupt hormonal suppression. The present study explored the effects of different treatments on experimental anxiety induced by progesterone withdrawal (PW) in a stress-sensitive rat strain, Wistar Kyoto (WKY), in the burying behavior test (BBT). The following experimental series was conducted using independent groups of Wistar (control strain) and WKY ovariectomized rats: Experiment 1: Rats were treated for 5 days with oil, a constant dose of progesterone (0.5 mg/rat, s.c) or a combination of progesterone (0.5 mg/rat, s.c) plus fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p); on day 6, all rats were subjected to BBT. Experiment 2: Rats received corn oil or decreasing doses of progesterone (0.84, 0.67, 0.5, 0.33 and 0.17 mg/rat; one dose daily); on day 6, the rats were subjected to BBT. Experiment 3: Rats were divided into two groups that were subjected to 30 days of standard conditions or environmental enrichment (EE); from days 25 to 30, all rats received a fixed dose of progesterone (0.5 mg/rat, s.c.) or vehicle. On day 31, the rats were tested with BBT. Results showed that PW increased anxiety in both strains, and fluoxetine prevented anxiety in WKY rats. In contrast, a gradual reduction of progesterone prevents the anxiety in Wistar but not in WKY. EE was preventive against the anxiety induced by PW in both strains of rats. Thus, the results suggest that anxiety induced by PW is prevented by EE while the anxiolytic effect of pharmacological treatments depends on stress vulnerability.

AB  - Abstract
Animals use multiple strategies to maintain spatial orientation. Dead reckoning is a form of spatial navigation that depends on self-movement cue processing. During dead reckoning, the generation of self-movement cues from a starting position to an animal’s current position allow for the estimation of direction and distance to the position movement originated. A network of brain structures has been implicated in dead reckoning. Recent work has provided evidence that the medial frontal cortex may contribute to dead reckoning in this network of brain structures. The current study investigated the organization of rat exploratory behavior subsequent to medial frontal cortex aspiration lesions under light and dark conditions. Disruptions in exploratory behavior associated with medial frontal lesions were consistent with impaired motor coordination, response inhibition, or egocentric reference frame. These processes are necessary for spatial orientation; however, they are not sufficient for self-movement cue processing. Therefore it is possible that the medial frontal cortex provides processing resources that support dead reckoning in other brain structures but does not of itself compute the kinematic details of dead reckoning.

AB  - Abstract
Motor learning with professional experience leads to cortical reorganization with plasticity. Long-term training facilitates motor cortical excitability. It is not clear how beneficial cortical plasticity is maintained during long-term training. We studied this question in 15 elite badminton athletes and 15 novices. We hypothesize that motor cortical excitation increases after long-term training and this is accompanied by increased motor cortical inhibition. Motor cortical excitation was measured with motor-evoked potential (MEP) input–output curve using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Motor cortical inhibition was measured with short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) by a paired-pulse TMS paradigm. We found MEP was increased at high TMS intensity and the MEP input–output curve was steeper in athletes compared to novices. Both SICI and LICI were also increased in athletes. In addition, both SICI and LICI were correlated with the slope of MEP input–output curve in athletes but not in novices. The slope of MEP input–output curve, SICI and LICI were also correlated with the training time in athletes. We conclude that both cortical excitation and cortical inhibition are increased, and that the balance between cortical excitation and inhibition is maintained during long-term training.

AB  - Abstract
Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) has been extensively applied to investigate the organization of functional networks in the brain. As an essential part of the central nervous system (CNS), the spinal cord has not been well explored about its intrinsic functional network. In this study, we aim to thoroughly investigate the characteristics of the intrinsic functional network in the spinal cord using rsfMRI. Functional connectivity and graph theory analysis were employed to evaluate the organization of the functional network, including its topology and network communication properties. Furthermore, the reproducibility of rsfMRI analysis on the spinal cord was also examined by intra-class correlation (ICC). Comprehensive evaluation of the intrinsic functional organization presented a non-uniform distribution of topological characteristics of the functional network, in which the upper levels (C2 and C3 vertebral levels) of the cervical spinal cord showed high levels of connectivity. The present results revealed the significance of the upper cervical cord in the intrinsic functional network of the human cervical spinal cord. In addition, this study demonstrated the efficiency of the cervical spinal cord functional network and the reproducibility of rsfMRI analysis on the spinal cord was also confirmed. As knowledge expansion of intrinsic functional network from the brain to the spinal cord, this study shed light on the organization of the spinal cord functional network in both normal development and clinical disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Adult neurogenesis participates in fish olfaction sensitivity in response to environmental challenges. Therefore, we investigated if several populations of stem/progenitor cells that are retained in the olfactory bulbs (OB) may constitute different neurogenic niches that support growth and functional demands. By electron microscopy and combination cell proliferation and lineage markers, we found that the telencephalic ventricle wall (VW) at OB level of Austrolebias charrua fish presents three neurogenic niches (transitional 1, medial 2 and ventral 3). The main cellular types described in other vertebrate neurogenic niches were identified (transient amplifying cells, stem cells and migrating neuroblasts). However, elongated vimentin/BLBP+ radial glia were the predominant cells in transitional and ventral zones. Use of halogenated thymidine analogs chloro- and iodo-deoxyuridine administered at different experimental times showed that both regions have the highest cell proliferation and migration rates. Zone 1 migration was toward the OB and telencephalon, whereas in zone 3, migration was directed toward the OB rostral portion constituting the equivalent of the mammal rostral migratory band. Medial zone (MZ) has fewer proliferating non-migrant cells that are the putative stem cells as indicated by short and long proliferation assays as well as cell lineage markers. Sparse migration observed suggests MZ may collaborate with VW growth. Scanning electron microscopy evidenced that the whole VW has only monociliated cells with remarkable differences in cilium length among regions. In OB there are monociliated cells with dwarf cilium whereas ventral telencephalon shows long cilium. Summarizing, we identified three neurogenic niches that might serve different functional purposes.

AB  - Abstract
It has been proposed that the post-ictal state is associated with the expression of hypoalgesia. It is clear that the projections among the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG), dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and locus coeruleus (LC) play a role in pain management. These mesencephalic structures have direct reciprocal opioid and monoaminergic projections to the LC that can possibly modulate post-ictal hypoalgesia. The goal of this study was to examine if LC-opioid and serotonergic/noradrenergic mechanisms signal the post-ictal hypoalgesic responses to tonic–clonic seizures produced by intraperitoneal administration of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ at 64 mg/kg), causing an ionophore γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated Cl− influx antagonism. The rodents’ nociceptive threshold was measured by the tail-flick test. Intra-LC cobalt chloride (1.0 nM/0.2 μL) microinjections produced intermittent local synaptic inhibition and were able to reduce post-ictal hypoalgesia. Central administration of naltrexone (a non-selective antagonist for opioid receptors), naloxonazine (a selective antagonist for μ1-opioid-receptors), methysergide (a non-selective antagonist for serotonergic receptors) or ketanserin (an antagonist for both α1-noradrenergic and 5-Hydroxytryptamine(HT)2A/2C receptors) at 5.0 μg/0.2 μL, R-96544 (a 5-HT2A receptor selective antagonist) at 10 nM/0.2 μL, or RS-102221 (a 5-HT2C receptor selective antagonist) at 0.15 μg/0.2 μL into the LC also decreased post-ictal hypoalgesia. The data presented here suggest that the post-ictal antinociception mechanism involves the μ1-opiod, 5-HT2A- and 5-HT2C-serotonergic, and α1-noradrenergic receptors in the LC.

AB  - Abstract
Cell-type determination is a complex process driven by the combinatorial effect of extrinsic signals and the expression of transcription factors and regulatory genes.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that, generally, inhibit the expression of target genes and have been involved, among other processes, in cell identity acquisition. To search for candidate miRNAs putatively involved in mice rod photoreceptor and Müller glia (MG) identity, we compared miRNA expression profiles between late-stage retinal progenitor cells (RPCs), CD73-immunopositive (CD73+) rods and postnatal MG. We found a close similarity between RPCs and CD73+ miRNA expression profiles but a divergence between CD73+ and MG miRNA signatures. We validated preferentially expressed miRNAs in the CD73+ subpopulation (miR-182, 183, 124a, 9∗, 181c and 301b∗) or MG (miR-143, 145, 214, 199a-5p, 199b∗, and 29a). Taking advantage of the unique capacity of MG to dedifferentiate into progenitor-like cells that can be differentiated to a rod phenotype in response to external cues, we evaluated changes of selected miRNAs in MG-derived progenitors (MGDP) during neuronal differentiation. We found decreased levels of miR-143 and 145, but increased levels of miR-29a in MGDP. In MGDPs committed to early neuronal lineages we found increased levels of miR-124a and upregulation of miR-124a, 9∗ and 181c during MGDP acquisition of rod phenotypes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ectopic miR-124 expression is sufficient to enhance early neuronal commitment of MGDP.

Our data reveal a dynamic regulation of miRNAs in MGDP through early and late neuronal commitment and miRNAs that could be potential targets to exploit the silent neuronal differentiation capacity of MG in mammals.

Older adults have a greater incidence of falls, and risk of falls will increase when combining two motor tasks. Thus, it is interesting to investigate the effect of fall history on motor performance in older adults when combining walking with another task such as grasping an object. The aim of this study was to investigate the combined task of walking and prehension with different levels of manual task difficulty in older adults with and without a history of falls. Thirty older adults participated in this study; groups were designated as fallers (n = 15) and non-fallers (n = 15). Participants were asked to reach-to-grasp a dowel during quiet standing and during walking. Level of manual task difficulty was manipulated by the type of dowel support and obstacles located at different distances to the sides of the dowel. Fall history influenced the performance of this combined task for the most difficult manual conditions. Fallers were able to be identified due to differences in the grasping strategies used while walking compared to non-fallers. In addition, walking and grasping were mutually modulated due to the level of difficulty of the manual task.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic abdominal pain is a common symptom of inflammatory bowel disease and often persists in the absence of gut inflammation. Although the mechanisms responsible for ongoing pain are unknown, clinical and preclinical evidence suggests lumbosacral spinal cord dorsal horn neurons contribute to these symptoms. At present, we know little about the intrinsic and synaptic properties of this population of neurons in either normal or inflammed conditions. Therefore, we developed an in vivo preparation to make patch-clamp recordings from superficial dorsal horn (SDH) neurons receiving colonic inputs in naïve male mice. Recordings were made in the lumbosacral spinal cord (L6–S1) under isoflurane anesthesia. Noxious colorectal distension (CRD) was used to determine whether SDH neurons received inputs from mechanical stimulation/distension of the colon. Responses to hind paw/tail cutaneous stimulation and intrinsic and synaptic properties were also assessed, as well as action potential discharge properties. Approximately 11% of lumbosacral SDH neurons in the cohort of neurons sampled responded to CRD and a majority of these responses were subthreshold. Most CRD-responsive neurons (80%) also responded to cutaneous stimuli, compared with &lt;50% of CRD-non-responsive neurons. Furthermore, CRD-responsive neurons had more hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials, larger rheobase currents, and reduced levels of excitatory drive, compared to CRD-non-responsive neurons. Our results demonstrate that CRD-responsive neurons can be distinguished from CRD-non-responsive neurons by several differences in their membrane properties and excitatory synaptic inputs. We also demonstrate that SDH neurons with colonic inputs show predominately subthreshold responses to CRD and exhibit a high degree of viscerosomatic convergence.

AB  - Abstract
Previous studies investigating the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain caused by injury to the spinal cord suggest that pain may result, at least in part, from maladaptive plasticity in the somatosensory cortex and associated pain networks. However, little is known about the molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to maladaptive plasticity in the cortex and how they contribute to the development of neuropathic pain.

AMPA-type glutamate receptors (GluARs) mediate fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the mammalian brain and play an important role in pain processing. Here we used an electrolytic lesion model of spinal cord injury in animals to study the expression and phosphorylation of GluA1 and 2 in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Experiments in rats and mice revealed that maladaptive plasticity and hypersensitivity after spinal cord lesion (SCL) are associated with a reduction in the fraction of GluA1 subunits that are phosphorylated at serine 831 (S831) in the hindlimb representation of S1 (S1HL). Manipulations that reduce the fraction of phosphorylated S831 in S1HL of non-lesioned animals, including low-frequency electrical stimulation and viral-mediated gene transfer of mutant S831, were associated with the development of hypersensitivity. Taken together, these findings suggest that phosphorylation of GluA1 at S831 plays an important role in the development of hypersensitivity after SCL.

AB  - Abstract
Exposure to maternal separation (MS) during early life is an identified risk factor for emotional disorders such as anxiety and depression later in life. This study investigated the effects of neonatal MS on the behavior and long-term potentiation (LTP) as well as basic synaptic transmission at hippocampal CA3-CA1 and mossy fiber (MF)-CA3 synapses in adolescent mice for 19 days. When mice were adolescents, we measured depression, learning, memory, anxious and aggressive behavior using the forced swimming test (FST), Y-maze, Morris water maze (MWM), elevated plus maze (EPM), three consecutive days of the open field test, the social interaction test, the tube-dominance test and the resident–intruder test. The results showed that there was no difference in FST, Y-maze, and MWM performance. However, MS mice showed more anxiety-like behavior in the EPM test and aggressive-like behavior in the tube-dominance and resident–intruder tests. In addition, the magnitude of LTP and release probability in the MF-CA3 synapses was reduced in the MS group but not in the CA3-CA1 synapse. Our results indicate that early life stress due to MS may induce anxiety- and aggressive-like behavior during adolescence, and these effects are associated with synaptic plasticity at the hippocampal MF-CA3 synapses.

AB  - Abstract
Activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) leads to cell growth and survival. We tested the hypothesis that inhibition of mTOR would increase infarct size and decrease microregional O2 supply/consumption balance after cerebral ischemia–reperfusion. This was tested in isoflurane-anesthetized rats with middle cerebral artery blockade for 1 h and reperfusion for 2 h with and without rapamycin (20 mg/kg once daily for two days prior to ischemia). Regional cerebral blood flow was determined using a C14-iodoantipyrine autoradiographic technique. Regional small-vessel arterial and venous oxygen saturations were determined microspectrophotometrically. The control ischemic-reperfused cortex had a similar blood flow and O2 consumption to the contralateral cortex. However, microregional O2 supply/consumption balance was significantly reduced in the ischemic-reperfused cortex. Rapamycin significantly increased cerebral O2 consumption and further reduced O2 supply/consumption balance in the reperfused area. This was associated with an increased cortical infarct size (13.5 ± 0.8% control vs. 21.5 ± 0.9% rapamycin). We also found that ischemia–reperfusion increased AKT and S6K1 phosphorylation, while rapamycin decreased this phosphorylation in both the control and ischemic-reperfused cortex. This suggests that mTOR is important for not only cell survival, but also for the control of oxygen balance after cerebral ischemia–reperfusion.

AB  - Abstract
Therapeutic hypothermia is widely used to treat neonatal hypoxic ischemic (HI) brain injuries. However, potentially deleterious effects of delaying the induction of hypothermia and of rewarming on white matter injury remain unclear. We used a piglet model of HI to assess the effects of delayed hypothermia and rewarming on white matter apoptosis. Piglets underwent HI injury or sham surgery followed by normothermic or hypothermic recovery at 2 h. Hypothermic groups were divided into those with no rewarming, slow rewarming at 0.5 °C/h, or rapid rewarming at 4 °C/h. Apoptotic cells in the subcortical white matter of the motor gyrus, corpus callosum, lateral olfactory tract, and internal capsule at 29 h were identified morphologically and counted by hematoxylin &amp; eosin staining. Cell death was verified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. White matter neurons were also counted, and apoptotic cells were immunophenotyped with the oligodendrocyte marker 2′,3′-cyclic-nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNPase). Hypothermia, slow rewarming, and rapid rewarming increased apoptosis in the subcortical white matter relative to normothermia (p &lt; 0.05). The number of white matter neurons was not lower in groups with more apoptosis after hypothermia or rapid rewarming, indicating that the apoptosis occurred among glial cells. Hypothermic piglets had more apoptosis in the lateral olfactory tract than those that were rewarmed (p &lt; 0.05). The promotion of apoptosis by hypothermia and rewarming in these regions was independent of HI. In the corpus callosum, HI piglets had more apoptosis than shams after normothermia, slow rewarming, and rapid rewarming (p &lt; 0.05). Many apoptotic cells were myelinating oligodendrocytes identified by CNPase positivity. Our results indicate that delaying the induction of hypothermia and rewarming are associated with white matter apoptosis in a piglet model of HI; in some regions these temperature effects are independent of HI. Vulnerable cells include myelinating oligodendrocytes. This study identifies a deleterious effect of therapeutic hypothermia in the developing brain.

AB  - Abstract
The objective of this study was to determine whether pre- to post-synaptic coupling of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) could be maintained in the face of significant morphological remodeling brought about by exercise training, and whether aging altered this capacity. Eighteen young adult (8 mo) and eighteen aged (24 mo) Fischer 344 rats were randomly assigned to either endurance trained (treadmill running) or untrained control conditions resulting in four groups (N = 9/group). After the 10-week intervention rats were euthanized and hindlimb muscles were surgically removed, quickly frozen at approximate resting length and stored at −85 °C. The plantaris and EDL muscles were selected for study as they have different functions (ankle extensor and ankle flexor, respectively) but both are similarly and overwhelmingly comprised of fast-twitch myofibers. NMJs were stained with immunofluorescent procedures and images were collected with confocal microscopy. Each variable of interest was analyzed with a 2-way ANOVA with main effects of age and endurance training; in all cases significance was set at P ⩽ 0.05. Results showed that no main effects of aging were detected in NMJs of either the plantaris or the EDL. Similarly, endurance training failed to alter any synaptic parameters of EDL muscles. The same exercise stimulus in the plantaris however, resulted in significant pre- and post-synaptic remodeling, but without altering pre- to post-synaptic coupling of the NMJs. Myofiber profiles of the same plantaris and EDL muscles were also analyzed. Unlike NMJs, myofibers displayed significant age-related atrophy in both the plantaris and EDL muscles. Overall, these results confirm that despite significant training-induced reconfiguration of NMJs, pre- to post-synaptic coupling remains intact underscoring the importance of maintaining proper apposition of neurotransmitter release and binding sites so that effective nerve to muscle communication is assured.

AB  - Abstract
Neuronal persistent activity has been primarily assessed in terms of electrical mechanisms, without attention to the complex array of molecular events that also control cell excitability. We developed a multiscale neocortical model proceeding from the molecular to the network level to assess the contributions of calcium (Ca2+) regulation of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels in providing additional and complementary support of continuing activation in the network. The network contained 776 compartmental neurons arranged in the cortical layers, connected using synapses containing AMPA/NMDA/GABAA/GABAB receptors. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) produced inositol triphosphate (IP3) which caused the release of Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores, with reuptake by sarco/ER Ca2+-ATP-ase pumps (SERCA), and influence on HCN channels. Stimulus-induced depolarization led to Ca2+ influx via NMDA and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs). After a delay, mGluR activation led to ER Ca2+ release via IP3 receptors. These factors increased HCN channel conductance and produced firing lasting for ∼1 min. The model displayed inter-scale synergies among synaptic weights, excitation/inhibition balance, firing rates, membrane depolarization, Ca2+ levels, regulation of HCN channels, and induction of persistent activity. The interaction between inhibition and Ca2+ at the HCN channel nexus determined a limited range of inhibition strengths for which intracellular Ca2+ could prepare population-specific persistent activity. Interactions between metabotropic and ionotropic inputs to the neuron demonstrated how multiple pathways could contribute in a complementary manner to persistent activity. Such redundancy and complementarity via multiple pathways is a critical feature of biological systems. Mediation of activation at different time scales, and through different pathways, would be expected to protect against disruption, in this case providing stability for persistent activity.

AB  - Abstract
Cochlear fibrosis is a common finding following cochlear implantation. Evidence suggests that cochlear fibrosis could be triggered by inflammation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal cell transition (EMT). In this study, we investigate the mechanisms of cochlear fibrosis and the risk/benefit ratio of local administration of the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone (DEX) and antimitotic drug aracytine (Ara-C). Cochlear fibrosis was evaluated in cochlear fibrosis models of rat cochlear slices in vitro and in KLH-induced immune labyrinthitis and platinum wire cochlear implantation-induced fibrosis in vivo.

Cochleae were invaded with tissue containing fibroblastic cells expressing α-SMA (alpha smooth muscle actin), which along with collagen I, fibronectin, and laminin in the extracellular matrix, suggests the involvement of a fibrotic process triggered by EMT in vitro and in vivo. After perilymphatic injection of an adenoviral vector expressing GFP in vivo, we demonstrated that the fibroblastic cells derived from the mesothelial cells of the scalae tympani and vestibuli. Activation of inflammatory and EMT pathways was further assessed by ELISA analysis of the expression of IL-1β and TGF-β1. Both markers were elevated in vitro and in vivo, and DEX and Ara-C were able to reduce IL-1β and TGF-β1 production.

After 5 days of culture in vitro, quantification of calcein-positive cells revealed that Ara-C was 30-fold more efficient in preventing fibrosis, and provoked less sensory hair cell loss, than DEX. In KLH-induced immune labyrinthitis and platinum wire-implanted models, Ara-C was more efficient in preventing proliferation of fibrosis with less side effects on hair cells and neurons than DEX. In conclusion, DEX and Ara-C both prevent fibrosis in the cochlea. Analysis of the risk/benefit ratio favors the use of Ara-C for preventing cochlear fibrosis.

AB  - Abstract
The tectofugal pathway in birds consists of four stations, the retina, optic tectum, rotundal nucleus, and entopallium, and it conveys visual information via three ascending pathways. These pathways consist of retino-tectal, tecto-rotundal and rotundo-entopallial cells, all of which are glutamatergic. The present study examined the localization of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) to identify the target areas of glutamatergic projections in the tectofugal pathway in pigeons. Nine subunits of iGluRs were analyzed using in situ hybridization as follows: AMPA receptors (GluA1, GluA2, GluA3, and GluA4), kainate receptors (GluK1, GluK2, and GluK4), and NMDA receptors (GluN1 and GluN2A). Hybridization signals of subunits showed various intensities in different cells. In the optic tectum, a strong to moderate expression was observed in layer 10 (GluA2, GluA3, GluK4, and GluN1) and layer 13 (GluA2, GluK4, GluN1, and GluN2A). The rotundal nucleus intensely expressed GluA3, GluA4, GluK1, and GluK4. In the entopallium, an intense to moderate expression of GluK1 and GluK4, and a moderate to weak expression of AMPA and NMDA receptors were observed. Furthermore, the parvocellular and magnocellular parts of the isthmic nuclei showed a strong expression of GluA2, GluA3, GluK4, and GluN1. The present findings demonstrate the expression of iGluRs in glutamatergic projection targets of the tectofugal pathway in birds and suggest a diversity of iGluRs in the transmission of visual information.

AB  - Abstract
Infarcts of the neonatal cerebral cortex can lead to progressive epilepsy, which is characterized by time-dependent increases in seizure frequency after the infarct and by shifts in seizure-onset zones from focal to multi-focal. Using a rat model of unilateral perinatal hypoxia–ischemia (PHI), where long-term seizure monitoring had previously demonstrated progressive epilepsy, evoked field potentials (EFPs) were recorded in layers II/III of coronal neocortical slices to analyze the underlying time-dependent, network-level alterations ipsilateral vs. contralateral to the infarct. At 3 weeks after PHI, EFPs ipsilateral to the infarct were normal in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF); however, after blocking GABAA receptors with bicuculline methiodide (BMI, 30 μM), the slices with an infarct were more hyperexcitable than slices without an infarct. At 3 weeks, contralateral PHI slices had responses indistinguishable from controls. Six months after PHI in normal ACSF, both ipsi- and contralateral slices from rats with cortical infarcts showed prolonged afterdischarges, which were only slightly augmented in BMI. These data suggest that the early changes after PHI are localized to the ipsilateral infarcted cortex and masked by GABA-mediated inhibition; however, after 6 months, progressive epileptogenesis results in generation of robust bilateral hyperexcitability. Because these afterdischarges were only slightly prolonged by BMI, a time-dependent reduction of GABAergic transmission is hypothesized to contribute to the pronounced hyperexcitability at 6 months. These changes in the EFPs coincide with the seizure semiology of the epilepsy and therefore offer an opportunity to study the mechanisms underlying this form of progressive pediatric epilepsy.

Previous studies have indicated that sodium salicylate (SS) can cause hearing abnormalities through affecting the central auditory system. In order to understand central effects of the drug, we examined how a single intraperitoneal injection of the drug changed the level of subunits of the type-B γ-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAB receptor) in the rat’s inferior colliculus (IC). Immunohistochemical and western blotting experiments were conducted three hours following a drug injection, as previous studies indicated that a tinnitus-like behavior could be reliably induced in rats within this time period. Results revealed that both subunits of the receptor, GABABR1 and GABABR2, reduced their level over the entire area of the IC. Such a reduction was observed in both cell body and neuropil regions. In contrast, no changes were observed in other brain structures such as the cerebellum. Thus, a coincidence existed between a structure-specific reduction in the level of GABAB receptor subunits in the IC and the presence of a tinnitus-like behavior. This coincidence likely suggests that a reduction in the level of GABAB receptor subunits was involved in the generation of a tinnitus-like behavior and/or used by the nervous system to restore normal hearing following application of SS.

AB  - Abstract
Noninvasive functional imaging holds great promise for the future of translational research, due to the ability to directly compare between preclinical and clinical models of psychiatric disorders. Despite this potential, concerns have been raised regarding the necessity to anesthetize rodent and monkey subjects during these procedures, because anesthetics may alter neuronal activity. For example, in studies on drugs of abuse and alcohol, it is not clear to what extent anesthesia can interfere with drug-induced neural activity. Therefore, the current study investigated whole-brain c-Fos activation following isoflurane anesthesia as well as ethanol-induced activation of c-Fos in anesthetized mice. In the first experiment, we examined effects of one or three sessions of gaseous isoflurane on c-Fos activation across the brain in male C57BL/6J mice. Isoflurane administration led to c-Fos activation in several areas, including the piriform cortex and lateral septum. Lower or similar levels of activation in these areas were detected after three sessions of isoflurane, suggesting that multiple exposures may eliminate some of the enhanced neuronal activation caused by acute isoflurane. In the second experiment, we investigated the ability of ethanol injection (1.5 or 2.5 g/kg i.p.) to induce c-Fos activation under anesthesia. Following three sessions of isoflurane, 1.5 g/kg of ethanol induced c-Fos in the central nucleus of amygdala and the centrally-projecting Edinger–Westphal nucleus (EWcp). This induction was lower after 2.5 g/kg of ethanol. These results demonstrate that ethanol-induced neural activation can be detected in the presence of isoflurane anesthesia. They also suggest, that while habituation to isoflurane helps reduce neuronal activation, interaction between effects of anesthesia and alcohol can occur. Studies using fMRI imaging could benefit from using habituated animals and dose–response analyses.

AB  - Abstract
Cochlea removal results in the death of 20–30% of neurons in the chick cochlear nucleus, nucleus magnocellularis (NM). Two potentially cytotoxic events, a dramatic rise in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and a decline in the integrity of ribosomes are observed within 1 h of deafferentation. Glutamatergic input from the auditory nerve has been shown to preserve NM neuron health by activating metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), maintaining both normal [Ca2+]i and ribosomal integrity. One interpretation of these results is that a common mGluR-activated signaling cascade is required for the maintenance of both [Ca2+]i and ribosomal integrity. This could happen if both responses are influenced directly by a common messenger, or if the loss of mGluR activation causes changes in one component that secondarily causes changes in the other. The present studies tested this common-mediator hypothesis in slice preparations by examining activity-dependent regulation of [Ca2+]i and ribosomes in the same tissue after selectively blocking group I mGluRs (1-Aminoindan-1,5-dicarboxylic acid (AIDA)) or group II mGluRs (LY 341495) during unilateral auditory nerve stimulation. Changes in [Ca2+]i of NM neurons were measured using fura-2 ratiometric calcium imaging and the tissue was subsequently processed for Y10B immunoreactivity (Y10B-ir), an antibody that recognizes a ribosomal epitope. The group I mGluR antagonist blocked the activity-dependent regulation of both [Ca2+]i and Y10B-ir, but the group II antagonist blocked only the activity-dependent regulation of Y10B-ir. That is, even when group II receptors were blocked, stimulation continued to maintain low [Ca2+]i, but it did not maintain Y10B-ir. These results suggest a dissociation in how calcium and ribosomes are regulated in NM neurons and that ribosomes can be regulated through a mechanism that is independent of calcium regulation.

AB  - Abstract
In the present study, we reveal myelin-specific expression and targeting of mRNA and biochemical pools of HspB5 in the mouse CNS. Our observations are based on in situ hybridization, electron microscopy and co-localization with 2′,3′-Cyclic-Nucleotide 3′-Phosphodiesterase (CNPase), reinforcing this myelin-selective expression. HspB5 mRNA might be targeted to these structures based on its presence in discrete clusters resembling RNA granules and the presence of a putative RNA transport signal. Further, sub-cellular fractionation of myelin membranes reveals a distinct sub-compartment-specific association and detergent solubility of HspB5. This is akin to other abundant myelin proteins and is consistent with HspB5’s association with cytoskeletal/membrane assemblies. Oligodendrocytes have a pivotal role in supporting axonal function via generating and segregating the ensheathing myelin. This specialization places extreme structural and metabolic demands on this glial cell type. Our observations place HspB5 in oligodendrocytes which may require selective and specific chaperone capabilities to maintain normal function and neuronal support.

AB  - Abstract
Many distinct ganglion cell types, which are the output elements of the retina, were found to encode for specific features of a visual scene such as contrast, color information or movement. The detailed composition of retinal circuits leading to this tuning of retinal ganglion cells, however, is apart from some prominent examples, largely unknown. Here we aimed to investigate if ganglion cell types in the mouse retina receive selective input from specific bipolar cell types or if they sample their synaptic input non-selectively from all bipolar cell types stratifying within their dendritic tree. To address this question we took an anatomical approach and immunolabeled retinae of two transgenic mouse lines (GFP-O and JAM-B) with markers for ribbon synapses and type 2 bipolar cells. We morphologically identified all green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing ganglion cell types, which co-stratified with type 2 bipolar cells and assessed the total number of bipolar input synapses and the proportion of synapses deriving from type 2 bipolar cells. Only JAM-B ganglion cells received synaptic input preferentially from bipolar cell types other than type 2 bipolar cells whereas the other analyzed ganglion cell types sampled their bipolar input most likely from all bipolar cell terminals within their dendritic arbor.

AB  - Abstract
Objective: Even if considered benign, absence epilepsy may alter memory and attention, sometimes subtly. Very little is known on behavior and cognitive functions in the Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) model of absence epilepsy. We focused on different memory systems and sustained visual attention, using Non Epileptic Controls (NECs) and Wistars as controls. Methods: A battery of cognitive/behavioral tests was used. The functionality of reference, working, and procedural memory was assessed in the Morris water maze (MWM), 8-arm radial maze, T-maze and/or double-H maze. Sustained visual attention was evaluated in the 5-choice serial reaction time task. Results: In the MWM, GAERS showed delayed learning and less efficient working memory. In the 8-arm radial maze and T-maze tests, working memory performance was normal in GAERS, although most GAERS preferred an egocentric strategy (based on proprioceptive/kinesthetic information) to solve the task, but could efficiently shift to an allocentric strategy (based on spatial cues) after protocol alteration. Procedural memory and visual attention were mostly unimpaired. Significance: Absence epilepsy has been associated with some learning problems in children. In GAERS, the differences in water maze performance (slower learning of the reference memory task and weak impairment of working memory) and in radial arm maze strategies suggest that cognitive alterations may be subtle, task-specific, and that normal performance can be a matter of strategy adaptation. Altogether, these results strengthen the “face validity” of the GAERS model: in humans with absence epilepsy, cognitive alterations are not easily detectable, which is compatible with subtle deficits.

AB  - Abstract
2-(3′,5′-Dimethoxybenzylidene) cyclopentanone (DMBC) is a novel small-molecule compound synthesized by our group. Here, we found that in rat models of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO), intraperitoneal injection (ip) of DMBC at 1 h after ischemia reduced infarct volume, improved neurological deficits and increased the protein levels of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP 2) and glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) in the ischemic cortex. Post-treatment of DMBC still produced neuroprotective effects even when administered at 6 h after ischemia. In the oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced astrocytes or HT22 cell injury, DMBC treatment decreased the OGD-induced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage and increased the GFAP levels in astrocytes. In addition, Annexin-V-Fluos staining analysis revealed that DMBC treatment attenuated both OGD-induced apoptosis and necrosis in astrocytes. Western blotting analysis showed DMBC treatment inhibited the ischemia or OGD-induced increases in active cathepsin B in the ischemic cortex or in astrocytes or HT22 cells. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that DMBC treatment blocked the ischemia or OGD-induced release of cathepsin B from the lysosomes into the cytoplasm in the ischemic cortex or in astrocytes or HT22 cells. Taken together, our results indicate that DMBC can offer neuroprotective effects against cerebral ischemia with an extended therapeutic window and its mechanism might be associated with inhibition of the cathepsin B activation.

AB  - Abstract
Modified non-motor brainstem ventilatory control might be involved in Parkinson’s disease. Our study was designed to investigate the impact of degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway on resting breathing and hypoxic ventilatory response in conscious rats. The role of central and peripheral dopamine D2 receptors in the modulation of the hypoxic ventilatory response in conditions of dopamine shortage was examined. Adult Wistar rats received a unilateral double 6-hydroxydopamine lesion of the right medial forebrain bundle. After surgery, animals were placed in whole-body plethysmographic chamber and exposed to hypoxia (8% O2). One group of animals received inraperitoneal injections of either haloperidol or domperidone before hypoxia. Levels of dopamine and its metabolite in the brainstem and striatum were assessed. Neurotoxin treatment evoked limb use asymmetry. No effect on the resting normoxic respiration was observed. An increase in tidal volume and a decrease in respiratory rate during respiratory response to hypoxia with short magnification of minute ventilation were predominant effects. Domperidone treatment in intact animals evoked a significant increase in normoxic tidal volume, while haloperidol potentiated tidal volume increase in response to hypoxia. After the lesion, the effects of both antagonists were absent. In rats with Parkinson’s, the content of dopamine and its metabolite decreased substantially in the injured striatum. Augmentation of a tidal volume response to hypoxia, and the absence of stimulatory effect of intraperitoneal domperidone on normoxic and haloperidol on hypoxic tidal volume, in lesioned rats indicated altered control of breathing. This could be the result of a dopamine deficiency in the striatum and an increased turnover of DOPAC/DA in the brainstem.

AB  - Abstract
Responses elicited by the rapid displacement of a light touch contact surface were investigated during standing with the eyes closed. During quiet standing the touch surface was moved with an imperceptible slow (0.5 Hz), small (0.5 cm) oscillation to entrain the participant’s sway. Periodically, a rapid displacement (1.25 cm, 12.5 cm/s peak velocity, 187.5 cm/s/s peak acceleration) of the rod was applied, either forward or backward, at either the fore or aft position of the entrained sway. Each participant received 10 unexpected displacements of the same direction, with 20 participants receiving forward displacements and 6 participants receiving backward displacements. Electromyographic recordings from 4 arm and 2 ankle muscles were sampled along with center of pressure and joint kinematics. Rapid displacement of the touch surface consistently resulted in short-latency (&lt;120 ms) responses in the muscles of the arm or ankle in 21 of 26 participants. However, the first exposure to the touch displacement resulted in a distinct response in the muscles about the ankle in 13 participants, while responses in arm muscles were observed in 11 participants. Participants that responded with activation of muscles at the ankle displayed a corresponding shift in the center of pressure. Trials 2 through 10 were characterized by an absence of responses in the ankle muscles, but more consistent responses in the arm muscles. The rapid onset of ankle muscle activity following the unexpected slip of a touch surface in some instances suggests that tactile cues provide a potential sensory cue for triggering balance reactions. The importance of this sensory cue in balance control is likely dependent in part on the relevance of the tactile inputs in the context of the perceived task.

AB  - Abstract
The complex network of anatomical connections of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) makes it an interface responsible for the selection and integration of cognitive and affective information to modulate appetitive or aversively motivated behaviour. There is evidence for NAc dysfunction in schizophrenia. NAc also seems to be important for antipsychotic drug action, but the biochemical characteristics of drug-induced alterations within NAc remain incompletely characterized. In this study, a comprehensive proteomic analysis was performed to describe the differences in the mechanisms of action of clozapine (CLO) and risperidone (RIS) in the rat NAc. Both antipsychotics influenced the level of microtubule-regulating proteins, i.e., stathmin, and proteins of the collapsin response mediator protein family (CRMPs), and only CLO affected NAD-dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin-2 and septin 6. Both antipsychotics induced changes in levels of other cytoskeleton-related proteins. CLO exclusively up-regulated proteins involved in neuroprotection, such as glutathione synthetase, heat-shock 70-kDa protein 8 and mitochondrial heat-shock protein 75. RIS tuned cell function by changing the pattern of post-translational modifications of some proteins: it down-regulated the phosphorylated forms of stathmin and dopamine and the cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32) isoform but up-regulated cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5). RIS modulated the level and phosphorylation state of synaptic proteins: synapsin-2, synaptotagmin-1 and adaptor-related protein-2 (AP-2) complex.

AB  - Abstract
The therapy of patients suffering the psychiatric disorder schizophrenia requires the usage of antipsychotic drugs that are classified into two different groups, the first-generation (FGAs) and the second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs).

This study compares the effects of the two FGAs haloperidol and flupentixol with those of the SGA olanzapine on synapse formation and synaptic activity of embryonic rat hippocampal neurons. To this end, the development of perineuronal nets (PNNs), the formation of synapses and the resulting spontaneous network activity under control and treatment conditions were studied using an indirect co-culture system of neurons and astrocytes in completely defined media.

The number and extent of PNNs that consist of extracellular matrix superstructures surrounding synapses was not altered in hippocampal neurons by exposure to antipsychotic drugs. In contrast treatment of hippocampal neurons with haloperidol led to a slight decrease whereas olanzapine induced a significant increase of the number of structural synapses after 13 days. This differential effect concerning synapse numbers was also reflected in the spontaneous activity of neuronal networks, as monitored on multielectrode arrays (MEAs). In that context, application of haloperidol reduced while olanzapine significantly enhanced network activity. Unexpectedly, flupentixol that is regarded as an FGA caused similar effects than the SGA olanzapine in that it augmented synapse number as well as network activity. Our pilot study provides a proof of concept that the neuron-astrocyte co-culture model can be used to investigate the impact of antipsychotics on pivotal parameters of neuronal cell biology. Thereby, it may support the comparative analysis of antipsychotics applied in the therapy of schizophrenia.

AB  - Abstract
The G-protein coupled receptor 6 (GPR6) is a constitutive active orphan GPCR which is predominantly expressed in striatopallidal neurons. GPR6 deficiency in mice may alter the susceptibility of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system relevant for Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here, we investigated the effect of GPR6 deficiency in mice on neurotoxicity induced by the dopaminergic neurotoxin MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine).

GPR6−/−- and control mice were treated with MPTP (4 × 12.5 mg/kg, i.p., 2 h intervals) and analyzed after seven days. Striatal dopamine (DA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylacetic acid (HVA) concentrations were measured by HPLC. The number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. In a separate group of mice, MPP+ (500 μM for 20 min) was administered via an intrastriatal microdialysis probe to measure the MPP+-induced DA release.

MPTP produced a significant reduction in striatal DA, DOPAC, HVA and an increase in dopamine turnover in control and GPR6−/−-mice. The MPTP-induced DA and HVA depletion was significantly more pronounced in GPR6−/−-mice. Consistently, the MPTP-induced reduction of TH-positive neurons in the SPpc was significantly higher in GPR6−/−-mice. Furthermore, the MPP+-induced dopamine release was significantly higher in GPR6−/−-mice.

In conclusion, we showed that MPTP induces an enhanced dopaminergic neurodegeneration in GPR6−/−-mice indicated by alterations at the striatal and nigral level. We propose that GPR6 signaling is involved in the cascade of neurodegenerative events of the parkinsonian neurotoxin MPTP and suggest that pharmacological modulation of GPR6 might represent an entry point to further investigate GPR6 in PD.

AB  - Abstract
Freezing of gait (FOG) is a common, disabling symptom of Parkinson’s disease (PD) that is associated with deficits in motor initiation and inhibition. Understanding of underlying neurobiological mechanisms has been limited by difficulties in eliciting and objectively characterizing such gait phenomena in the clinical setting. However, recent work suggests that virtual reality (VR) techniques might offer the potential to study motor control. This study utilized a VR paradigm to explore deficits in motor initiation and stopping performance, including stop failure in PD patients with (Freezers, 31) and without (Non-Freezers, 23) FOG, and healthy age-matched Controls (15). The VR task required subjects to respond to a series of start and stop cues while navigating a corridor using ankle flexion/extension movements on foot pedals. We found that Freezers experienced slower motor output initiation and more frequent start hesitations (SHs) (initiations greater than twice a subject’s usual initiation latency) compared to Non-Freezers and Controls. Freezers also showed more marked inhibitory impairments, taking significantly longer to execute motor inhibition, and experiencing an increased frequency of failed stopping in response to stop cues compared to Non-Freezers and Controls. Stopping impairments were exacerbated by stop cues requiring additional cognitive processing. These results suggest that PD patients with FOG have marked impairments in motor initiation and inhibition that are not prominent in patients without FOG, nor healthy controls. Future work combining such VR paradigms with neuroimaging techniques and intra-operative deep brain recordings may increase our understanding of these phenomena, promoting the development of novel technologies and therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Abstract
In spite of the fact that the functional organization of primary visual cortices (V1) differs across species, the dynamic of orientation selectivity is highly structured within neuronal populations. In fact, neurons functionally connect each other in an organized Hebbian process, wherein their wiring and firing are intimately related. Moreover, neuronal ensembles have been suggested to be strongly implicated in sensory processing. Within these ensembles, neurons may be sharply or broadly tuned in relation to the stimulus. Therefore, it is important to determine the relationship between the response selectivity of neurons and their functional connectivity pattern across species. In the present investigation, we sought to compare the stimulus-evoked functional connectivity between the broadly tuned and the sharply tuned neurons in two species exhibiting different cortical organization for orientation selectivity: cats (columnar-organized) and mice (salt-and-pepper organization). In addition, we examined the distribution of connectivity weights within cell-assemblies in the visual cortex during visual adaptation. First, we report that the sharply tuned neurons exhibited higher synchrony index than the broadly tuned cells in the cat visual cortex. On the contrary, in mice, the broadly tuned cells displayed higher connectivity index. Second, a significant correlation was found between the connectivity strength and the difference of preferred orientations of neurons for both species. Finally, we observed a systematic adjustment of the connectivity weights within neuronal ensembles in mouse primary visual cortex similarly to the cat V1.

Here, DTI-based connectivity within isolated abdominal ganglia of Aplysia californica (ABG) is analyzed using network theory. In addition to quantifying the regional physical proprieties of the fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient, DTI tractography was used to probe inner-connections of local communities, yielding unweighted, undirected graphs that represent community structures. Local and global efficiency, characteristic path lengths and clustering analysis are performed on both experimental and simulated data. The relevant intensity by which these specific nodes communicate is probed through weighted clustering coefficient measurements. Both small-worldness and novel small-world metrics were used as tools to verify the small-world properties for the experimental results. The aim of this manuscript is to categorize the properties exhibited by structural networks in a model neural tissue to derive unique mean field information that quantitatively describe macroscopic connectivity. For ABG, findings demonstrate a default structural network with preferential specific small-world properties when compared to simulated lattice and random networks that are equivalent in order and degree.

AB  - Abstract
Subcortical band heterotopia (SBH) are malformations of the human cerebral cortex typically associated with epilepsy and cognitive delay/disability. Rodent models of SBH have demonstrated strong face validity as they are accompanied by both cognitive deficits and spontaneous seizures or reduced seizure threshold. BXD29-Tlr4lps-2J/J recombinant inbred mice display striking bilateral SBH, partial callosal agenesis, morphological changes in subcortical structures of the auditory pathway, and display sensory deficits in behavioral tests (Rosen et al., 2013; Truong et al., 2013, 2015). Surprisingly, these mice show no cognitive deficits and have a higher seizure threshold to chemi-convulsive treatment (Gabel et al., 2013) making them different than other rodent SBH models described previously. In the present report, we perform a detailed characterization of the cellular and axonal constituents of SBH in BXD29-Tlr4lps-2J/J mice and demonstrate that various types of interneurons and glia as well as cortical and subcortical projections are found in SBH. In addition, the length of neuronal cilia was reduced in SBH compared to neurons in the overlying and adjacent normotopic cortex. Finally, we describe additional and novel malformations of the hippocampus and neocortex present in BXD29-Tlr4lps-2J/J mice. Together, our findings in BXD29-Tlr4lps-2J/J mice are discussed in the context of the known neuroanatomy and phenotype of other SBH rodent models.

AB  - Abstract
The inferior colliculus (IC), a midbrain structure that processes acoustic information of aversive nature, is distinguished from other auditory nuclei in the brainstem by its connections with structures of the motor system. Previous evidence relating the IC to motor behavior shows that glutamatergic and GABAergic mechanisms in the IC exert influence on systemic haloperidol-induced catalepsy. There is substantial evidence supporting a role played by the endocannabinoid system as a modulator of the glutamatergic neurotransmission, as well as the dopaminergic activity in the basal nuclei and therefore it may be considered as a potential pharmacological target for the treatment of movement disorders. The present study evaluated if the endocannabinoid system in the IC plays a role in the elaboration of systemic haloperidol-induced catalepsy. Male Wistar rats received intracollicular microinjection of either the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide (AEA) at different concentrations (5, 50 or 100 pmol/0.2 μl), the CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist AM251 at 50, 100 or 200 pmol/0.2 μl or vehicle, followed by intraperitoneal (IP) administration of either haloperidol at 0.5 or 1 mg/kg or physiological saline. Systemic injection of haloperidol at both doses (0.5 or 1 mg/kg, IP) produced a cataleptic state, compared to vehicle/physiological saline-treated group, lasting 30 and 50 min after systemic administration of the dopaminergic receptors non-selective antagonist. The midbrain microinjection of AEA at 50 pmol/0.2 μl increased the latency for stepping down from the horizontal bar after systemic administration of haloperidol. Moreover, the intracollicular administration of AEA at 50 pmol/0.2 μl was able to increase the duration of catalepsy as compared to AEA at 100 pmol/0.2-μl-treated group. Intracollicular pretreatment with AM251 at the intermediate concentration (100 pmol/0.2 μl) was able to decrease the duration of catalepsy after systemic administration of haloperidol. However, neither the intracollicular microinjection of AM251 at the lowest (50 pmol/0.2 μl) nor at the highest (200 pmol/0.2 μl) concentration was able to block the systemic haloperidol-induced catalepsy. Furthermore, the intracollicular administration of AM251 at 100 pmol/0.2 μl was able to decrease the duration of catalepsy as compared to AM251 at 50 pmol/0.2 μl- and AM251 at 200 pmol/0.2-μl-treated group. The latency for stepping down from the horizontal bar – induced by haloperidol administration – was decreased when microinjection of AEA at 50 pmol/0.2 μl was preceded with blockade of CB1 receptor with AM251 (100 pmol/0.2 μl). Our results strengthen the involvement of CB1-signaled endocannabinoid mechanisms of the IC in the neuromodulation of catalepsy induced by systemic administration of the dopaminergic receptors non-selective antagonist haloperidol.

AB  - Abstract
The apical dendrite of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells receives information from the entorhinal cortex via the dentate gyrus and CA3 (Schaffer-collateral (SC) input) proximally within the stratum radiatum (SR) and directly from the entorhinal cortex/thalamus distally within the stratum lacunosum–moleculare (SLM). During the early postnatal development, very low/low frequency (0.033–1 Hz) activation of previously non-stimulated (naïve) SC synapses (SR-CA1 synapses) results in a stimulus-, but not frequency-, dependent depression which is explained by postsynaptic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) silencing. This lability of AMPA signaling has been suggested to play a role in the activity-dependent organization of the SR synaptic input. Compared with the SR region the SLM region is matured earlier and may become organized in a different manner. Here, using field recordings of synaptic activity in hippocampal slices from 2nd postnatal week rats, we found that SLM-CA1 synapses are also readily depressed by activity in the very low/low frequency range (0.033–1 Hz). The depression was, however, quite distinct from that of SR-CA1 synapses, being frequency dependent and reversing faster following stimulus interruption. Bath application of an AMPA receptor agonist produced only a small (−8%) post-application (10 min) depression of SLM-CA1 synapses in contrast to that of SR-CA1 synapses (−33%). The SLM-CA1 synapses did also exhibit less long-term depression than the SR-CA1 synapses. We conclude that in the developing hippocampus the labile glutamate signaling onto CA1 pyramidal cell depends mechanistically on input pathway. The labile AMPA signaling at SLM-CA1 synapses is most likely explained by a presynaptic mechanism with limited amount of postsynaptic AMPA silencing.

AB  - Abstract
The subiculum is the output component of the hippocampal formation and holds a key position in the neural circuitry of memory. Previous studies have demonstrated the subiculum’s connectivity to other brain areas in detail; however, little is known regarding its internal structure. We investigated the cytoarchitecture of the temporal and mid-septotemporal parts of the subiculum using immunohistochemistry. The border between the CA1 region and subiculum was determined by both cytoarchitecture and zinc transporter 3 (ZnT3)-immunoreactivity (IR), whereas the border between the subiculum and presubiculum (PreS) was partially indicated by glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1)-IR. The subiculum was divided into proximal and distal subfields based on cytoarchitecture and immunohistochemistry for calbindin (CB), nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and Purkinje cell protein 4 (PCP4). The proximal subiculum (defined here as subiculum 2) was composed of five layers: the molecular layer (layer 1), the medium-sized pyramidal cell layer (layer 2) that contained NOS- and PCP4-positive neurons, the large pyramidal cell layer (layer 3) characterized by the accumulation of ZnT3- (more proximally) and vesicular glutamate transporter 2-positive (more distally) boutons, layer 4 containing polymorphic cells, and the deepest layer 5 composed of PCP4-positive cells with long apical dendrites that reached layer 1. The distal subiculum (subiculum 1) consisting of smaller neurons did not show these features. Quantitative analyses of the size and numerical density of somata substantiated this delineation. Both the proximal–distal division and five-layered structure in the subiculum 2 were confirmed throughout the temporal two-thirds of the subiculum. These findings will provide a new structural basis for hippocampal investigations.

AB  - Abstract
Pur-alpha is a highly conserved sequence-specific DNA and RNA binding protein with established roles in DNA replication, RNA translation, cell cycle regulation, and maintenance of neuronal differentiation. Prior studies have shown that mice lacking Pur-alpha (−/−) display decreased neurogenesis and impaired neuronal differentiation. We sought to examine for the first time, the behavioral phenotype and brain histopathology of mice that are heterozygous (+/−) for Pur-alpha. Standardized behavioral phenotyping revealed a decreased escape response to touch, limb and abdominal hypotonia, and gait abnormalities in heterozygous Pur-alpha (+/−) mice, compared to wild-type (+/+) littermates. Footprint pattern analyses showed wider-based steps, increased missteps and more outwardly rotated hindpaws in heterozygous Pur-alpha (+/−) mice, suggestive of cerebellar pathology. The Barnes maze and novel object location testing revealed significant memory deficits in heterozygous Pur-alpha mice, suggestive of hippocampal pathology. Quantitative immunohistochemical assays of the vermal region of the cerebellum and CA1-3 regions of the hippocampus revealed reduced numbers of neurons in general, as well as reduced numbers of Pur-alpha+-immunopositive neurons and dendrites in heterozygous Pur-alpha mice, compared to wild-type littermates. Past studies have implicated mutations in Pur-alpha in several diseases of brain development and neurodegeneration. When combined with these new findings, the Pur-alpha heterozygous knockout mice may provide an animal model to study mechanisms of and treatments for Pur-alpha-related cognitive deficiencies and neuropathology.

AB  - Abstract
The theta rhythm is necessary for hippocampal-dependent spatial learning. It has been proposed that each hippocampal stratum can generate a current theta dipole. Therefore, considering that each hippocampal circuit (CA1, CA3, and Dentate Gyrus (DG)) contributes differently to distinct aspects of a spatial memory, the theta oscillations on each stratum and their couplings may exhibit oscillatory dynamics associated with different stages of learning. To test this hypothesis, the theta oscillations from five hippocampal strata were recorded in the rat during different stages of learning in a Morris maze. The peak power, the relative power (RP) and the coherence between hippocampal strata were analyzed. The early acquisition stage of the Morris task was characterized by the predominance of slow frequency theta activity and high coupling between specific hippocampal strata at slow frequencies. However, on the last training day, the theta oscillations were faster in all hippocampal strata, with tighter coupling at fast frequencies between the CA3 pyramidal stratum and other strata. Our results suggest that modifications to the theta frequency and its coupling can be a means by which the hippocampus differentially operates during acquisition and retrieval states.

AB  - Abstract
Brain–blood barrier (BBB) disruption results in vasogenic edema, which is involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Following status epilepticus (SE), up-regulated transient receptor potential canonical channel-3 (TRPC3), a Ca2+-permeable cation channels in endothelial cells, is relevant to vasogenic edema formation in the rat piriform cortex. In addition, pyrazole-3 (Pyr-3, a TRPC3 inhibitor) attenuated SE-induced vasogenic edema. However, the upstream regulators of TRPC3 expression in vasogenic edema formation have been unclear. In the present study, soluble tumor necrosis factor p55 receptor (sTNFp55R, a TNF-α inhibitor), SN50 (a nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) inhibitor), BQ-788 (an endothelin B (ETB) receptor inhibitor) and Pyr-3 effectively prevented vasogenic edema following SE. sTNFp55R and SN50 (but not BQ-788) attenuated SE-induced up-regulation of endothelial TRPC3 expression. Pyr-3 ameliorated SE-induced NFκB p65-Thr435 phosphorylation and ETB receptor expression. In addition, Pyr-3 mitigated NFκB p65-Thr435 phosphorylation induced by recombinant TNF-α. These findings indicate that TNF-α-mediated NFκB p65-Thr435 phosphorylation may up-regulate TRPC3 expression, which participates in vasogenic edema formation via increasing endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression following SE, independent of ETB receptor activation. Therefore, we suggest that TRPC3 may be involved in a positive feedback loop of NFκB/ETB receptor signaling pathway.

AB  - Abstract
Sleep deprivation (SD) upsurges intracellular levels of adenosine, impairs adult neuronal cell proliferation (NCP) and cognition while caffeine, a non-selective adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) antagonist improves cognition and adult NCP during SD. We examined the selective antagonistic effects of adenosine A1R using 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine (8-CPT) on impairment of spatial reference memory and adult NCP during 48 h SD. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were sleep deprived for 48 h, using an automatic cage vibrating stimulus based on animal activity. Spatial reference memory was tested as a measure of cognitive performance employing Morris Water Maze. Rats were given 8-CPT dissolved in 50% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), twice daily (10 mg/kg, i.p.) along with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (50 mg/kg/day, i.p.). The rats treated with 8-CPT showed significantly short mean latency and path-length to reach the platform compared to the SD rats. Consistent with these findings, 8-CPT-treated group was found to have significantly increased the number of BrdU, Ki-67 and doublecortin (DCX) positive cells. However, no significant difference was seen in NeuN expression in the Dentate Gyrus (DG). Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) expression in the DG and CA1 region was observed to decrease significantly after SD and be rescued by 8-CPT treatment. Furthermore, latency to reach platform showed a negative correlation with number of BrdU, DCX type-1 cells and BDNF expression in DG. Thus, it may be concluded that treatment with 8-CPT, an adenosine A1R antagonist during SD mitigates SD induced decline in spatial reference memory and adult NCP possibly via up regulation of BDNF levels in DG and CA1 regions.

AB  - Abstract
Humans and non-human primates are known to lengthen their response time (RT) to a go signal when they occasionally must cancel their responses following a stop signal in a countermanding task as well as to adjust their RT adaptively on a trial-by-trial basis. Less is clear regarding the adaptive RT adjustments in the countermanding performance of rodents. To investigate this question, male Wistar rats (N = 12) were trained with food reward to press a lever directly below an illuminated light (go signal), but to countermand the lever press subsequent to a tone (stop signal) presented infrequently (25% of trials) at variable delays. Rats were then tested in a standard responding task (0% stop trials) or a countermanding task with a 10-s or 1-s TO interval following errors. Rats exhibited significant RT lengthening in the countermanding task, compared with the standard responding task, and RT shortening following consecutive correct go trials. They also show RT lengthening following both error trials in the standard responding task and unrewarded, non-canceled stop trials in the countermanding task. RT lengthening following erroneous stop trials was observed in sessions with a 10-s TO interval, but not with a 1-s TO interval. Analyses of RT distributions suggest that RT lengthening results largely from reduced sensitivity to the go signal, but also from reduced readiness. These findings indicate that rats exert control in the countermanding task by lengthening RT in anticipation of stop trials to avoid long, unrewarded TO intervals.

AB  - Abstract
Infants that succumb to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) have been identified with inner ear dysfunction (IED) at birth and on autopsy. We previously investigated whether IED could play a mechanistic role in SIDS. We discovered that animals with IED displayed significant suppression of movement arousal to a hypoxic–hypercarbic gas mixture under light anesthesia. In the current study we investigated the role of each gas in triggering movements and the response to hypercarbia during natural sleep without anesthesia. Seventeen-day-old CD-1 mice received intra-tympanic gentamicin (IT-Gent) injections to precipitate IED. The movement response to hypercarbia, hypoxia and hypoxia-hypercarbia was compared to controls under light anesthesia. Hypercarbia did not stimulate vigorous movements in any animals under either sleep condition. Hypoxia triggered vigorous movements in controls (p &lt; 0.05) and a decreased response in IT-Gent animals under light anesthesia. This contrasted with combined hypoxia-hypercarbia, in which IT-Gent animals displaced significantly suppressed movements compared to controls (p &lt; 0.05). Our findings portray that a degree of intact inner ear function is necessary for instigating the movement response. Additionally, hypoxia is the trigger for the movement response while carbon dioxide (CO2) suppresses it. The finding that carbon dioxide did not stimulate movement during natural sleep is an important finding. This contrasts with other studies that have identified hypercarbia as an arousal stimulus with EEG. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the precise role of the inner ear in the movement response and potential association with SIDS. The early detection of IED in SIDS predisposed cases could be invaluable.

AB  - Abstract
Menopausal women often suffer from hot flashes and sleep disturbances that significantly impact their quality of life. Both human and animal studies suggest that loss of estrogens during menopause contribute to these symptoms. In the female rat, both core body temperature (CBT) and sleep are sensitive to 17β-estradiol (E2) levels, but important differences between the rat and the human patterns limit the interpretation of the results. The sleep and thermoregulation of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) more closely resemble human patterns. However, no study to date has examined whether E2 influences sleep and thermoregulation in this species. The main goal of the present study was to investigate the suitability of the ovariectomized (OVX) marmoset for studying two major menopausal symptoms experienced by women, sleep disturbance and thermodysregulation. Two middle-aged OVX marmosets (6 years old) were implanted with a telemeter that records electroencephalograms (EEG), electromyograms (EMG), and CBT. Sleep patterns and CBT were recorded under baseline, two E2 replacement (6 and 12 μg/kg/day, p.o.) conditions and two E2 withdrawal conditions. Relative to both baseline and withdrawal, high E2 replacement was associated with lower nighttime CBT. In addition, fewer nighttime arousals were observed under low E2 replacement compared to baseline. Higher delta power was observed under both E2 replacement conditions suggesting enhanced sleep quality. These preliminary results suggest that E2 modulates sleep and thermoregulation in the OVX marmoset, making it a promising model for studying menopausal symptoms.

AB  - Abstract
Neuroglobin (Ngb) is a respiratory protein that is almost exclusively expressed in the vertebrate nervous system. Despite many years of research, the exact function and even the expression sites of Ngb are still a matter of debate. However, to investigate hypotheses surrounding the potential roles of Ngb, a detailed knowledge of its major and minor expression sites is indispensable. We have therefore evaluated Ngb expression by extensive bioinformatic analysis using publicly available transcriptome data (RNA-Seq). During mammalian brain development, we observed low embryonic expression of Ngb mRNA and an increase after birth, arguing against a role of Ngb in fetal hypoxia tolerance. In adult mouse brain, we found highest Ngb mRNA levels in the hypothalamus, where expression was up to 100-fold stronger than in cerebral cortex, cerebellum or hippocampus, as confirmed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. High Ngb expression in the hypothalamus was found conserved in humans and other mammals. Thus, Ngb mRNA is expressed at a basal level in many mammalian brain regions, but shows distinctive regional peaks. RNA-Seq analysis further revealed only low levels of Ngb mRNA in retina and testes and no signal in standard tumor cell lines, thus raising questions concerning previous studies and functional hypotheses. In conclusion, this broad-scale expression study may point to distinct Ngb functions for high- and low-expressing cells and tissues and argues against a single, generic role of Ngb as an oxygen supplier or as an endogenous protectant in all nerve cells.

AB  - Abstract
Unexpected presentation of a startling auditory stimulus (SAS &gt; 120 decibels) in a reaction time (RT) paradigm results in the startle reflex and an early release (&lt;100 ms) of the preplanned motor response (StartReact effect). Mechanical perturbations applied to the upper limbs elicit short- (M1) and long-latency (M2) stretch reflexes and have also been shown to initiate intended motor responses early (&lt;100 ms). Ravichandran et al. (2013) recently proposed that unexpected delivery of a perturbation could also elicit a startle response and therefore the StartReact effect may be responsible for the early trigger of a preplanned response. To investigate this further, we examined startle incidence, RT, and stretch reflex modulation for both expected and unexpected perturbations. In Experiment 1, participants performed active (ACT) and passive (DNI) conditions to an expected large perturbation (similar to previous studies examining M2). The startle response was not observed; however, the perturbation still elicited the voluntary response at short latency (&lt;100 ms) and goal-dependent modulation of the M2 response was observed. In Experiment 2, participants performed ACT and DNI conditions to a weak auditory stimulus or a small wrist perturbation. On unexpected trials we probed startle circuitry with a large perturbation or SAS. The SAS consistently elicited a startle response in both ACT and DNI conditions, but startle-like activity was only observed on 17.4% of ACT perturbation probe trials. Our findings suggest that while unexpected upper limb perturbations can be startling, startle triggering of the preplanned voluntary response is not the primary mechanism responsible for goal-dependent modulation of the M2 response.

AB  - Abstract
Maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) is suggested to function as a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and to play roles in various human cancers. However, the functional properties of MEG3 in ischemic stroke remain unknown. Here, we report that expression of MEG3 is upregulated following ischemia in adult mice. Moreover, cerebral ischemia recruits p53 into the MEG3 complex in ischemic tissues. MEG3 directly binds with the p53 DNA binding domain (DBD) consisting of amino acids 271–282 (p53-DBD271–282), which stimulates p53-mediated transactivation and mediates ischemic neuronal death. Administration of the membrane-permeable peptide inhibitor Tat-p53-DBD271–282 uncouples p53 from MEG3 in vivo and protects against cerebral ischemic insults in vitro and in vivo. Our data demonstrate that MEG3 functions as a cell death promoter in ischemia and physically and functionally interacts with p53 to mediate ischemic damage. Intervention in the MEG3–p53 interaction presents a new target for the therapeutic treatment of ischemic insults.

AB  - Abstract
Rhynchophylline (RIN) is a significant active component isolated from the Chinese herbal medicine Uncaria rhynchophylla. Several studies have demonstrated that RIN has a significant anticonvulsant effect in many types of epilepsy models in vivo. However, the mechanisms of the anticonvulsant effect remain elusive. Using combined methods of behavioral testing, immunofluorescence and electrophysiological recordings, we characterized the anticonvulsant effect of RIN in a pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and investigated the underlying cellular mechanisms. In one set of experiments, rats received RIN treatment prior to pilocarpine injection. In a second set of experiments, rats received RIN treatment following the onset of stage 3 seizures. Pretreatment and posttreatment with RIN effectively reduced the seizure severity in the acute phase of TLE. Furthermore, RIN protected medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) layer III neurons from neuronal death and terminated spontaneous epileptiform discharge of mEC layer II neurons in SE-experienced rats. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings indicated that RIN inhibited neuronal hyperexcitability via inhibition of the persistent sodium current (INaP) and NMDA receptor current. Immunofluorescence experiments also demonstrated that RIN rectified the pilocarpine-induced upregulation of Nav1.6 and NR2B protein expression. In conclusion, our results identified RIN as an anticonvulsant agent that inhibited ictal discharge via INap and NMDA receptor current inhibition.

AB  - Abstract
The leading treatments for severe hearing disabilities work on the principle of conveying electrical pulses to the auditory brainstem that enable perception of speech. It is currently not known how well the brainstem neurons specialized for decoding such coarse sound information develop when deprived of auditory input activity. Here, we used congenitally deaf α1D−/− mice, lacking activity in the auditory nerve, to investigate the superior paraolivary nucleus (SPON) – a prominent mammalian brainstem structure that responds selectively to sound pulses by rebound spiking. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from SPON neurons in the α1D−/− and control mice were obtained at equivalent pre- and post-hearing onset ages. The results show that SPON neurons in the α1D−/− display less precise, plateau-like rebound spiking compared to control neurons. However, the rebound spiking mechanism undergoes strong compensation with age in the α1D−/−. Voltage-activated Ca2+-currents lower the spike threshold, rescuing the capacity for spike initiation at pre-hearing onset ages. Gradual up-regulation of the inwardly rectifying h-current contributes to depolarize the membrane potential. Reduction of the membrane time constant and less recruitment of Ca2+-currents thereby normalize precise rebound spiking at post-hearing onset ages. We found the soluble form of the neurotrophic factor neuritin to be up-regulated in SPON of deaf mice, which may have promoted neuronal survival and prolonged plasticity of the SPON circuitry. A stereotyped timeline of compensation of rebound spiking in deaf SPON neurons indicates robust intrinsic regulation of the brainstem circuitry encoding sound rhythms. This may be a prerequisite for successful cochlear implants.

AB  - Abstract
Attentional deficits including difficulty in switching attention between tasks or rules, sustaining attention, and selectively attending to specific stimuli are commonly seen in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). While these deficits are frequently reported, it is unclear how traditional dopamine replacement therapy such as l-dopa affects these deficits. In a rat model of PD in which dopamine is unilaterally depleted with a 6-hydroxydopamine infusion to the medial forebrain bundle, we first examined the impact of acute and chronic l-dopa treatment on attention switching as modeled by disengagement behavior (i.e. the ability to disengage from an on-going behavior such as eating or drinking to attend to perioral stimulation). Then, in a separate experiment, we evaluated the effects of l-dopa treatment on selective and sustained attention deficits using a five choice task.

Our data suggest that the l-dopa dose necessary to recover motor function can successfully restore attention switching behavior (i.e. disengagement behavior), but further worsens performance in the selective and sustained attention task. Furthermore, this same dose was responsible for inducing dyskinesias in rats given chronic daily injections. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that dopamine replacement therapy may not be sufficient for treating all types of attentional dysfunction occurring in PD.

AB  - Abstract
Treatment strategies for ischemic stroke are still limited, since numerous attempts were successful only in preclinical research but failed under clinical condition. To overcome this translational roadblock, clinical relevant stroke models should consider co-morbidities, age-related effects and the complex neurovascular unit (NVU) concept. The NVU includes neurons, vessels and glial cells with astrocytic endfeet in close relation to the extracellular matrix (ECM). However, the role of the ECM after stroke-related tissue damage is poorly understood and mostly neglected for treatment strategies. This study is focused on alterations of perineuronal nets (PNs) as ECM constituents and parvalbumin-containing GABAergic neurons in mice with emphasis on the nucleus reticularis thalami (NRT) in close proximity to the ischemic lesion as induced by a filament-based stroke model. One day after ischemia onset, immunofluorescence-based quantitative analyses revealed drastically declined PNs in the ischemia-affected NRT from 3- and 12-month-old wildtype and co-morbid triple-transgenic (3xTg) mice with Alzheimer-like alterations. Parvalbumin-positive cells decreased numerically in the ischemia-affected NRT, while staining intensity did not differ between the affected and non-affected hemisphere. Additional qualitative analyses demonstrated ischemia-induced loss of PNs and allocated neuropil ECM immunoreactive for aggrecan and neurocan, and impaired immunoreactivity for calbindin, the potassium channel subunit Kv3.1b and the glutamate decarboxylase isoforms GAD65 and GAD67 in the NRT. In conclusion, these data confirm PNs as highly sensitive constituents of the ECM along with impaired neuronal integrity of GABAergic neurons. Therefore, specific targeting of ECM components might appear as a promising strategy for future treatment strategies in stroke.

AB  - Abstract
When subjects learn a novel motor task, several sources of feedback (proprioceptive, visual or auditory) contribute to the performance. Over the past few years, several studies have investigated the role of visual feedback in motor learning, yet evidence remains conflicting. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the role of online visual feedback (VFb) on the acquisition and retention stages of motor learning associated with training in a reaching task. Thirty healthy subjects made ballistic reaching movements with their dominant arm toward two targets, on 2 consecutive days using a robotized exoskeleton (KINARM). They were randomly assigned to a group with (VFb) or without (NoVFb) VFb of index position during movement. On day 1, the task was performed before (baseline) and during the application of a velocity-dependent resistive force field (adaptation). To assess retention, participants repeated the task with the force field on day 2. Motor learning was characterized by: (1) the final endpoint error (movement accuracy) and (2) the initial angle (iANG) of deviation (motor planning). Even though both groups showed motor adaptation, the NoVFb-group exhibited slower learning and higher final endpoint error than the VFb-group. In some condition, subjects trained without visual feedback used more curved initial trajectories to anticipate for the perturbation. This observation suggests that learning to reach targets in a velocity-dependent resistive force field is possible even when feedback is limited. However, the absence of VFb leads to different strategies that were only apparent when reaching toward the most challenging target.

AB  - Abstract
l-Glutamate and l-aspartate are the main excitatory amino acids (EAAs) in the Central Nervous System (CNS) and their uptake regulation is critical for the maintenance of the excitatory balance. Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) are widely distributed among central neurons and glial cells. GLAST and GLT1 are expressed in glial cells, whereas excitatory amino acid transporter 3/excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAT3/EAAC1) is neuronal. Different signaling pathways regulate glutamate uptake by modifying the activity and expression of EAATs. In the present work we show that immature postnatal day 3 (PN3) rat retinas challenged by l-glutamate release [3H]-d-Aspartate linked to the reverse transport, with participation of NMDA, but not of non-NMDA receptors. The amount of [3H]-d-Aspartate released by l-glutamate is reduced during retinal development. Moreover, immature retinae at PN3 and PN7, but not PN14, exposed to a single dose of 200 or 500 μM caffeine or the selective A2A receptor (A2AR) antagonist 100 nM ZM241385 decreased [3H]-d-Aspartate uptake. Caffeine also selectively increased total expression of EAAT3 at PN7 and its expression in membrane fractions. However, both EAAT1 and EAAT2 were reduced after caffeine treatment in P2 fraction. Addition of 100 nM DPCPX, an A1 receptor (A1R) antagonist, had no effect on the [3H]-d-Aspartate uptake. [3H]-d-Aspartate release was dependent on both extracellular sodium and Dl-TBOA, but not calcium, implying a transporter-mediated mechanism. Our results suggest that in the developing rat retina caffeine modulates [3H]-d-Aspartate uptake by blocking adenosine A2AR.

AB  - Abstract
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are involved in many fundamental cellular responses such as growth, death, movement, transcription and excitation. Their roles in human stem cell neural specialization are not well understood. In this study, we aimed to identify GPCRs that may play a role in the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to neural stem cells (NSCs). Using a feeder-free hESC neural differentiation protocol, we found that the expression of several chemokine receptors changed dramatically during the hESC/NSC transition. Especially, the expression of CXCR4 increased approximately 50 folds in NSCs compared to the original hESCs. CXCR4 agonist SDF-1 promoted, whereas the antagonist AMD3100 delayed the neural induction process. In consistence with antagonizing CXCR4, knockdown of CXCR4 in hESCs also blocked the neural induction and cells with reduced CXCR4 were rarely positive for Nestin and Sox1-staining. Taken together, our results suggest that CXCR4 is involved in the neural induction process of hESC and it might be considered as a target to facilitate NSC production from hESCs in regenerative medicine.

AB  - Abstract
Neurons in the auditory cortex synchronize their responses to temporal regularities in sound input. This coupling or “entrainment” is thought to facilitate beat extraction and rhythm perception in temporally structured sounds, such as music. As a consequence of such entrainment, the auditory cortex responds to an omitted (silent) sound in a regular sequence. Although previous studies suggest that the auditory brainstem frequency-following response (FFR) exhibits some of the beat-related effects found in the cortex, it is unknown whether omissions of sounds evoke a brainstem response. We simultaneously recorded cortical and brainstem responses to isochronous and irregular sequences of consonant–vowel syllable /da/ that contained sporadic omissions. The auditory cortex responded strongly to omissions, but we found no evidence of evoked responses to omitted stimuli from the auditory brainstem. However, auditory brainstem responses in the isochronous sound sequence were more consistent across trials than in the irregular sequence. These results indicate that the auditory brainstem faithfully encodes short-term acoustic properties of a stimulus and is sensitive to sequence regularity, but does not entrain to isochronous sequences sufficiently to generate overt omission responses, even for sequences that evoke such responses in the cortex. These findings add to our understanding of the processing of sound regularities, which is an important aspect of human cognitive abilities like rhythm, music and speech perception.

AB  - Abstract
Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), one of whose characteristics is high impulsivity, is of great interest in the field of brain structure and function. However, little is known about possible impairments in the cortical anatomy in ASPD, in terms of cortical thickness (CTh) and surface area (SA), as well as their possible relationship with impulsivity. In this neuroimaging study, we first investigated the changes of CTh and SA in ASPD patients, in comparison to those of healthy controls, and then performed correlation analyses between these measures and the ability of impulse control. We found that ASPD patients showed thinner cortex while larger SA in several specific brain regions, i.e., bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG), orbitofrontal and triangularis, insula cortex, precuneus, middle frontal gyrus (MFG), middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and left bank of superior temporal sulcus (STS). In addition, we also found that the ability of impulse control was positively correlated with CTh in the SFG, MFG, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), pars triangularis, superior temporal gyrus (STG), and insula cortex. To our knowledge, this study is the first to reveal simultaneous changes in CTh and SA in ASPD, as well as their relationship with impulsivity. These cortical structural changes may introduce uncontrolled and callous behavioral characteristic in ASPD patients, and these potential biomarkers may be very helpful in understanding the pathomechanism of ASPD.

AB  - Abstract
Functional columns of primary auditory cortex (AI) are arranged in layers, each composed of highly connected fine-scale networks. The basic response properties and interactions within these local subnetworks have only begun to be assessed. We examined the functional diversity of neurons within the laminar microarchitecture of cat AI to determine the relationship of spectrotemporal processing between neighboring neurons. Neuronal activity was recorded across the cortical layers while presenting a dynamically modulated broadband noise. Spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) and their nonlinear input/output functions (nonlinearities) were constructed for each neuron and compared for pairs of neurons simultaneously recorded at the same contact site. Properties of these local neuron pairs showed greater similarity than non-paired neurons within the same column for all considered parameters including firing rate, envelope-phase precision, preferred spectral and temporal modulation frequency, as well as for the threshold and transition of the response nonlinearity. This higher functional similarity of paired versus non-paired neurons was most apparent in infragranular neuron pairs, and less for local supragranular and granular pairs. The functional similarity of local paired neurons for firing rate, best temporal modulation frequency and two nonlinearity aspects was laminar dependent, with infragranular local pair-wise differences larger than for granular or supragranular layers.

Synchronous spiking events between pairs of neurons revealed that simultaneous ‘Bicellular’ spikes, in addition to carrying higher stimulus information than non-synchronized spikes, encoded faster modulation frequencies. Bicellular functional differences to the best matched of the paired neurons could be substantial. Bicellular nonlinearities showed that synchronous spikes act to transmit stimulus information with higher fidelity and precision than non-synchronous spikes of the individual neurons, thus, likely enhancing stimulus feature selectivity in their target neurons. Overall, the well-correlated and temporally precise processing within local subnetworks of cat AI showed laminar-dependent functional diversity in spectrotemporal processing, despite high intra-columnar congruity in frequency preference.

AB  - Abstract
The activities of 178 taste-responsive neurons were recorded extracellularly from the parabrachial nucleus (PbN) in the anesthetized C57BL/6J mouse. Taste stimuli included those representative of five basic taste qualities, sweet, salty, sour, bitter and umami. Umami synergism was represented by all sucrose-best and sweet-sensitive sodium chloride-best neurons. Mediolaterally the PbN was divided into medial, brachium conjunctivum (BC) and lateral subdivisions while rostrocaudally the PbN was divided into rostral and caudal subdivisions for mapping and reconstruction of recording sites. Neurons in the medial and BC subdivisions had a significantly greater magnitude of response to sucrose and to the mixture of monopotassium glutamate and inosine monophosphate than those found in the lateral subdivision. In contrast, neurons in the lateral subdivision possessed a more robust response to quinine hydrochloride. Rostrocaudally no difference was found in the mean magnitude of response. Analysis on the distribution pattern of neuron types classified by their best stimulus revealed that the proportion of neuron types in the medial vs. lateral and BC vs. lateral subdivisions was significantly different, with a greater amount of sucrose-best neurons found medially and within the BC, and a greater amount of sodium chloride-, citric acid- and quinine hydrochloride-best neurons found laterally. There was no significant difference in the neuron-type distribution between rostral and caudal PbN. We also assessed breadth of tuning in these neurons by calculating entropy (H) and noise-to-signal (N/S) ratio. The mean N/S ratio of all neurons (0.43) was significantly lower than that of H value (0.64). Neurons in the caudal PbN had a significantly higher H value than in the rostral PbN. In contrast, mean N/S ratios were not different both mediolaterally and rostrocaudally. These results suggest that although there is overlap in taste quality representation in the mouse PbN, taste-responsive neurons still possessed a topographic organization.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We implemented an in-scanner rat model of mild SAH in which blood or vehicle was injected into the cistern magna, and applied multimodal MRI to study the brain prior to, immediately after (5 min to 4 h), and upto 7 days after SAH. Vehicle injection did not change arterial lumen diameter, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), T2, venous signal, vascular reactivity to hypercapnia, or foot-fault scores, but mildly reduce cerebral blood flow (CBF) up to 4 h, and open-field activity up to 7 days post injection. By contrast, blood injection caused: (i) vasospasm 30 min after SAH but not thereafter, (ii) venous abnormalities at 3 h and 2 days, delayed relative to vasospasm, (iii) reduced basal CBF and to hypercapnia 1–4 h but not thereafter, (iv) reduced ADC immediately after SAH but no ADC and T2 changes on days 2 and 7, and (v) reduced open-field activities in both SAH and vehicle animals, but no significant differences in open-field activities and foot-fault tests between groups. Mild SAH exhibited transient and mild hemodynamic disturbances and diffusion changes, but did not show apparent ischemic brain injury nor functional deficits.

Sensorineural hearing loss has long been the subject of experimental and clinical research for many years. The recently identified novel mutation of the Cadherin23 (Cdh23) gene, Cdh23erl/erl, was proven to be a mouse model of human autosomal recessive nonsyndromic deafness (DFNB12). Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a taurine-conjugated bile acid, has been used in experimental research and clinical applications related to liver disease, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and other diseases associated with apoptosis. Because hair cell apoptosis was implied to be the cellular mechanism leading to hearing loss in Cdh23erl/erl mice (erl mice), this study investigated TUDCA’s otoprotective effects in erl mice: preventing hearing impairment and protecting against hair cell death. Our results showed that systemic treatment with TUDCA significantly alleviated hearing loss and suppressed hair cell death in erl mice. Additionally, TUDCA inhibited apoptotic genes and caspase-3 activation in erl mouse cochleae. The data suggest that TUDCA could be a potential therapeutic agent for human DFNB12.

AB  - Abstract
Isoflurane-induced neurocognitive impairment in the developing rodent brain is well documented, and regular physical exercise has been demonstrated to be a viable intervention for some types of neurocognitive impairment. This study was designed to investigate the potential protective effect of swimming exercise on both neurocognitive impairment caused by repeated neonatal exposure to isoflurane and the underlying molecular mechanism. Mice received 0.75% isoflurane exposures for 4 h on postnatal days 7, 8, and 9. From the third month after anesthesia, the mice were subjected to regular swimming exercise for 4 weeks, followed by a contextual fear condition (CFC) trial. We found that repeated neonatal exposure to isoflurane reduced freezing behavior during CFC testing and deregulated hippocampal histone H4K12 acetylation. Conversely, mice subjected to regular swimming exercise showed enhanced hippocampal H3K9, H4K5, and H4K12 acetylation levels, increased numbers of c-Fos-positive cells 1 h after CFC training, and less isoflurane-induced memory impairment. We also observed increases in histone acetylation and of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) during the swimming exercise program. The results suggest that neonatal isoflurane exposure-induced memory impairment was associated with dysregulation of H4K12 acetylation, which may lead to less hippocampal activation following learning tasks. Swimming exercise was associated with enhanced hippocampal histone acetylation and CBP expression. Exercise most likely ameliorated isoflurane-induced memory impairment by enhancing hippocampal histone acetylation and activating more neuron cells during memory formation.

AB  - Abstract
Neuroimaging and postmortem studies of subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) reveal smaller hippocampal volume with lengthening duration of illness. Pathology in astrocytes may contribute significantly to this reduced volume and to the involvement of the hippocampus in MDD. Postmortem hippocampal tissues were collected from 17 subjects with MDD and 17 psychiatrically-normal control subjects. Sections from the body of the hippocampus were immunostained for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of intermediate filament protein expressed in astrocytes. The density of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes was measured in the hippocampus using 3-dimensional cell counting. Hippocampal subfields were also assessed for GFAP-immunoreactive area fraction. In CA1, there was a significant positive correlation between age and either density or area fraction in MDD. The density of astrocytes in the hilus, but not CA1 or CA2/3, was significantly decreased only in depressed subjects not taking an antidepressant drug, but not for depressed subjects taking an antidepressant drug. The area fraction of GFAP-immunoreactivity was significantly decreased in the dentate gyrus in women but not men with depression. In CA2/3, the area fraction of GFAP-immunoreactivity was inversely correlated with the duration of depression in suicide victims. Astrocyte contributions to neuronal function in the hilus may be compromised in depressed subjects not taking antidepressant medication. Due to the cross-sectional nature of the present study of postmortem brain tissue, it remains to be determined whether antidepressant drug treatment prevented a decrease in GFAP-immunoreactive astrocyte density or restored cell density to normal levels.

AB  - Abstract
Dopamine D3 receptors (D3Rs) are implicated in several aspects of cognition, but their role in aversive conditioning has only been marginally uncovered. Investigations have reported that blockade of D3Rs enhances the acquisition of fear memories, a phenomenon tightly linked to the neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP). However, the impact of D3R ablation on the PACAPergic system in regions critical for the formation of new memories remains unexplored. To address this issue, levels of PACAP and its receptors were compared in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex (CX) of mice devoid of functional D3Rs (D3R−/−) and wild-types (WTs) using a series of comparative immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses. Morphometric and stereological data revealed increased hippocampal area and volume in D3R−/− mice, and augmented neuronal density in CA1 and CA2/3 subfields. PACAP levels were increased in the hippocampus of D3R−/− mice. Expression of PACAP receptors was also heightened in mutant mice. In the CX, PACAP immunoreactivity (IR), was restricted to cortical layer V in WTs, but was distributed throughout layers IV–VI in D3R−/− mice, along with increased mRNAs, protein concentration and staining scores. Consistently, PAC1, VPAC1 and VPAC2 IRs were variably redistributed in CX, with a general upregulation in cortical layers II–IV in knockout animals. Our interpretation of these findings is that disturbed dopamine neurotransmission due to genetic D3R blockade may enhance the PACAP/PAC1–VPAC axis, a key endogenous system for the processing of fear memories. This could explain, at least in part, the facilitated acquisition and consolidation of aversive memories in D3R−/− mice.

AB  - Abstract
Cholesterol is an essential substance for maintaining normal structure and function of the brain. But unfortunately, a long-term high-cholesterol diet can lead to a variety of pathological changes of the brain such as β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation, Tau hyperphosphorylation, reactive gliosis, neuroinflammation, neuronal death and synaptic degeneration. These pathological changes have complex internal relations with one other, causing memory impairment and participating in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, early hypercholesterolemia-induced events that lead to brain deterioration are not clear. To address this, 6-month-old female mice were fed a 3% cholesterol diet for 8 weeks, followed by behavioral, biochemical and neuropathological analyses. The high-cholesterol-fed mice did not show neuronal and synaptic impairment or cognitive deficits compared with mice given a normal diet, but astrocytes were mildly activated with increased expression of functional markers including apolipoprotein E and aquaporin 4 in the hippocampus. Hippocampal interleukin-1β expression slightly increased, but interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α did not change significantly compared with those in the control group. Levels of Aβ, and its precursor protein, were unaffected, but levels of presenilin 1 and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), that initiate Aβ generation and degradation, respectively, increased in the hippocampus of the model mice. In addition, Tau phosphorylation levels were not different between the control and model groups. These results suggest that changes in astrocyte functional markers and Aβ metabolism proteins, which contribute to maintaining brain cholesterol and Aβ homeostasis, are early events in the process of hypercholesterolemia-related neuropathological changes.

Functional brain abnormalities including memory loss are found to be associated with pathological changes in connectivity and network neural structures. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) interferes with memory formation from the molecular level, to synaptic functions and neural networks organization. Here, we determined whether brain connectivity of resting-state networks correlate with memory in patients affected by AD and in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). One hundred and forty-four subjects were recruited: 70 AD (MMSE Mini Mental State Evaluation 21.4), 50 MCI (MMSE 25.2) and 24 healthy subjects (MMSE 29.8). Undirected and weighted cortical brain network was built to evaluate graph core measures to obtain Small World parameters. eLORETA lagged linear connectivity as extracted by electroencephalogram (EEG) signals was used to weight the network. A high statistical correlation between Small World and memory performance was found. Namely, higher Small World characteristic in EEG gamma frequency band during the resting state, better performance in short-term memory as evaluated by the digit span tests. Such Small World pattern might represent a biomarker of working memory impairment in older people both in physiological and pathological conditions.

AB  - Abstract
Neuronatin (NNAT) is a small transmembrane proteolipid that is highly expressed in the embryonic developing brain and several other peripheral tissues. This study is the first to provide evidence that NNAT is detected in the adult retina of various adult rod-dominant mammals, including wild-type (WT) rodents, transgenic rodents expressing mutant S334ter, P23H, or T17M rhodopsin, non-human primates, humans, and cone-dominant tree shrews. Immunohistochemical and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses were applied to detect NNAT. Confocal microscopy analysis revealed that NNAT immunofluorescence is restricted to the outer segments (OSs) of photoreceptors without evidence of staining in other retinal cell types across all mammalian species. Moreover, in tree shrew retinas, we found NNAT to be co-localized with rhodopsin, indicating its predominant expression in rods. The rod-derived expression of NNAT was further confirmed by qRT-PCR in isolated rod photoreceptor cells. We also used these cells to mimic cellular stress in transgenic retinas by treating them with the endoplasmic reticulum stress inducer, tunicamycin. Thus, our data revealed accumulation of NNAT around the nucleus as compared to dispersed localization of NNAT within control cells. This distribution coincided with the partial intracellular mislocalization of NNAT to the outer nuclear layer observed in transgenic retinas. In addition, stressed retinas demonstrated an increase of NNAT mRNA and protein levels. Therefore, our study demonstrated that NNAT is a novel stress-responsive protein with a potential structural and/or functional role in adult mammalian retinas.

AB  - Abstract
Proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) may accumulate in the brain during status epilepticus, but whether it contributes to the progressive refractoriness of SE remains unclear. By using a kainic acid-induced SE mice model, we tested whether pharmacological blockade or knock-out of interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1) could influence the diazepam-refractory phenomenon of prolonged SE. We confirmed diazepam failed to terminate prolonged SE (allowed to continue for 40 min before diazepam administration). The expression level of IL-1β in the hippocampus during prolonged SE was significantly higher than that of baseline. Interestingly, prolonged SE was not diazepam-refractory in IL-1R1 knock-out mice. Moreover, administration of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) combined with diazepam terminated established prolonged SE, while IL-1RA alone is not capable to terminate prolonged SE. On the contrary, administration of recombinant human IL-1β weakens the efficacy of diazepam by prolonging its latency to terminate non-prolonged SE. Thus, the present study provides direct evidence that accumulated IL-1β contributed to the diazepam refractoriness of prolonged SE, and suggests that interleukin-1 receptor is a target for adjunctive control of diazepam-refractory SE.

Beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposition and neuroinflammation are involved in Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-type neurodegeneration with cognitive deficits. Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors have recently been studied as a potential target for cognitive enhancement by reducing inflammatory responses and Aβ levels. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of icariside II (ICS II), a novel PDE5 inhibitor derived from the traditional Chinese herb Epimedium brevicornum, on cognitive deficits, Aβ levels and neuroinflammation induced by intracerebroventricular-streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) in rats. The results demonstrated that ICV-STZ exhibited cognitive deficits and neuronal morphological damage, along with Aβ increase and neuroinflammation in the rat hippocampus. ICS II improved cognitive deficits, attenuated neuronal death, and decreased the levels of Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42 and PDE5 in the hippocampus of STZ rats. Furthermore, administration of ICS II at the dose of 10 mg/kg for 21 days significantly suppressed the expression of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-secretase1 (BACE1) and increased the expressions of neprilysin (NEP) together with inhibited interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) levels. In addition, ICS II exerted a beneficial effect on inhibition of IκB-α degradation and NF-κB activation induced by STZ. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that ICS II was a potential therapeutic agent for AD treatment.

AB  - Abstract
It is well-known that the neuroprotective effects of estrogen have potential in the prevention and amelioration of ischemic and degenerative neurological disorders, while the underlying mechanisms for estrogen actions are undefined. As an important mediator for the non-genomic functions of estrogen, GPER1 (G Protein-coupled Estrogen Receptor 1) has been suggested to involve in the beneficial roles of estrogen in neural cells. Here our studies on primary hippocampal neurons have focused on GPER1 in an in vitro model of ischemia using oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). GPER1 expression in the primary hippocampal neurons was stimulated by the OGD treatments. Both E2 (estradiol) and E2-BSA (membrane impermeable estradiol by covalent conjugation of bovine serum albumin) attenuated OGD-induced cell death in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons. Importantly, this membrane-mediated estrogen function requires GPER1 protein. Knocking down of GPER1 diminished, while overexpression of GPER1 potentiated, the protective roles of E2/E2-BSA following OGD. Additionally, the downstream mechanisms employed by membrane-associated estrogen signaling were found to include PI3K/Akt-dependent Ask1 inhibition in the primary hippocampal neurons. Overall, these research results could enhance our understanding of the neuroprotective actions for estrogen, and provide a new therapeutic target for improving stroke outcome and ameliorating degenerative neurological diseases.

AB  - Abstract
Several genetic mutations affecting the development and function of mammalian hair cells have been shown to cause deafness but not vestibular defects, most likely because vestibular deficits are sometimes centrally compensated. The study of hair cell physiology is thus a powerful direct approach to ascertain the functional status of the vestibular end organs. Deletion of Epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8 (Eps8), a gene involved in actin remodeling, has been shown to cause deafness in mice. While both inner and outer hair cells from Eps8 knockout (KO) mice showed abnormally short stereocilia, inner hair cells (IHCs) also failed to acquire mature-type ion channels. Despite the fact that Eps8 is also expressed in vestibular hair cells, Eps8 KO mice show no vestibular deficits. In the present study we have investigated the properties of vestibular Type I and Type II hair cells in Eps8-KO mice and compared them to those of cochlear IHCs. In the absence of Eps8, vestibular hair cells show normally long kinocilia, significantly shorter stereocilia and a normal pattern of basolateral voltage-dependent ion channels. We have also found that while vestibular hair cells from Eps8 KO mice show normal voltage responses to injected sinusoidal currents, which were used to mimic the mechanoelectrical transducer current, IHCs lose their ability to synchronize their responses to the stimulus. We conclude that the absence of Eps8 produces a weaker phenotype in vestibular hair cells compared to cochlear IHCs, since it affects the hair bundle morphology but not the basolateral membrane currents. This difference is likely to explain the absence of obvious vestibular dysfunction in Eps8 KO mice.

AB  - Abstract
Autophagy plays an important role in spinal cord ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury, but its neuroprotective or neurodegenerative role remains controversial. The extent and persistence of autophagy activation may be the critical factor to explain the opposing effects. In this study, the different roles and action mechanisms of autophagy in the early and later stages after I/R injury were investigated in rats. The spinal cord I/R injury was induced by 14-min occlusion of the aortic arch, after which rats were treated with autophagic inhibitor (3-methyladenine, 3-MA) or agonist (rapamycin) immediately or 48 h following the injury. Autophagy markers, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3-II) and Beclin 1 increased and peaked at the early stage (8 h) and the later stage (72 h) after spinal cord I/R injury. Beclin 1 was mostly expressed in neurons, but was also expressed to an extent in astrocytes, microglia and vascular endothelial cells. 8 h after injury, rats treated with 3-MA showed a decrease in the hind-limb Basso–Beattie–Bresnahan (BBB) motor function scores, surviving motor neurons, and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) expression, and increase in the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells, Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) expression, and activation of microglia, while those treated with rapamycin showed opposing effects. However, 72 h after injury, rats treated with 3-MA improved the BBB scores, and the surviving motor neurons, and reduced the autophagic cell death, while those treated with rapamycin had adverse effects. These findings provide the first evidence that early activated autophagy alleviates spinal cord I/R injury via inhibiting apoptosis and inflammation; however later excessively elevated autophagy aggravates I/R injury through inducing autophagic cell death.

AB  - Abstract
The globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) is a component of the basal ganglia, a network of subcortical nuclei that process motor, associative, and limbic information. While non-human primate studies have suggested a role for the GPi in non-motor functions, there have been no single-unit studies of non-motor electrophysiological behavior of human GPi neurons. We therefore sought to extend these findings by collecting single-unit recordings from awake patients during functional stereotactic neurosurgery targeting the GPi for deep brain stimulation. To assess cellular responses to non-motor information, patients performed a reward task where virtual money could be won, lost, or neither, depending on their performance while cellular activity was monitored. Changes in the firing rates of isolated GPi neurons after the presentation of reward-related stimuli were compared between different reward contingencies (win, loss, null). We observed neurons that modulated their firing rate significantly to the presentation of reward-related stimuli. We furthermore found neurons that responded to visual-stimuli more broadly. This is the first single-unit evidence of human GPi neurons carrying non-motor information. These results are broadly consistent with previous findings in the animal literature and suggest non-motor information may be represented in the single-unit activity of human GPi neurons.

AB  - Abstract
The brain is highly plastic and undergoes changes in response to many experiences. Learning especially can induce structural remodeling of dendritic spines, which is thought to relate to memory formation. Classical Pavlovian fear conditioning (FC) traditionally pairs an auditory cue with an aversive footshock, and has been widely used to study neural processes underlying associative learning and memory. Past research has found dendritic spine changes after FC in several structures. But, due to heterogeneity of cells within brain structures and limitations of traditional neuroanatomical techniques, it is unclear if all cells included in analyses were actually active during learning processes, even if known circuits are isolated. In this study, we employed a novel approach to analyze structural plasticity explicitly in neurons activated by exposure to either cued or uncued footshocks. We used male and female Arc-dVenus transgenic mice, which express the Venus fluorophore driven by the activity-related Arc promoter, to identify neurons that were active during either scenario. We then targeted fluorescent microinjections to Arc+ and neighboring Arc− neurons in the basolateral area of the amygdala (BLA) and auditory association cortex (TeA). In both BLA and TeA, Arc+ neurons had reduced thin and mushroom spine densities compared to Arc− neurons. This effect was present in males and females alike and also in both cued and uncued shock groups. Overall, this study adds to our understanding of how neuronal activity affects structural plasticity, and represents a methodological advance in the ways we can directly relate structural changes to experience-related neural activity.

AB  - Abstract
The purpose of this study was to investigate the nature of the variables and rules underlying the planning of unrestrained 3D arm reaching. To identify whether the brain uses kinematic, dynamic and energetic values in an isolated manner or combines them in a flexible way, we examined the effects of speed variations upon the chosen arm trajectories during free arm movements. Within the optimal control framework, we uncovered which (possibly composite) optimality criterion underlays at best the empirical data. Fifteen participants were asked to perform free-endpoint reaching movements from a specific arm configuration at slow, normal and fast speeds. Experimental results revealed that prominent features of observed motor behaviors were significantly speed-dependent, such as the chosen reach endpoint and the final arm posture. Nevertheless, participants exhibited different arm trajectories and various degrees of speed dependence of their reaching behavior. These inter-individual differences were addressed using a numerical inverse optimal control methodology. Simulation results revealed that a weighted combination of kinematic, energetic and dynamic cost functions was required to account for all the critical features of the participants’ behavior. Furthermore, no evidence for the existence of a speed-dependent tuning of these weights was found, thereby suggesting subject-specific but speed-invariant weightings of kinematic, energetic and dynamic variables during the motor planning process of free arm movements. This suggested that the inter-individual difference of arm trajectories and speed dependence was not only due to anthropometric singularities but also to critical differences in the composition of the subjective cost function.

AB  - Abstract
Pathological narcissism is often characterized by arrogant behavior, a lack of empathy, and willingness to exploit other individuals. Generally, individuals with high levels of narcissism are more likely to suffer mental disorders. However, the brain structural basis of individual pathological narcissism trait among healthy people has not yet been investigated with surface-based morphometry. Thus, in this study, we investigated the relationship between cortical thickness (CT), cortical volume (CV), and individual pathological narcissism in a large healthy sample of 176 college students. Multiple regression was used to analyze the correlation between regional CT, CV, and the total Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI) score, adjusting for age, sex, and total intracranial volume. The results showed that the PNI score was significantly negatively associated with CT and CV in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, key region of the central executive network, CEN), which might be associated with impaired emotion regulation processes. Furthermore, the PNI score showed significant negative associations with CV in the right postcentral gyrus, left medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), and the CT in the right inferior frontal cortex (IFG, overlap with social brain network), which may be related to impairments in social cognition. Together, these findings suggest a unique structural basis for individual differences in pathological narcissism, distributed across different gray matter regions of the social brain network and CEN.

AB  - Abstract
Mitochondrial ferritin (FtMt), a recently-studied iron storage protein, which we suspect is an important defense against oxidative stress in neurons and elsewhere. The 242-amino acid FtMt precursor protein is cleaved to mature protein (of molecular weight about 22-kDa) in the mitochondrial matrix. Compared with the ubiquitously expressed traditional ferritin (H-ferritin and L-ferritin), FtMt has been found in fewer locations including the testis, heart and brain. Previous studies have reported that the expression of FtMt in mouse and human brain is predominantly localized to neurons and partly to glial cells, and FtMt exerts protective effects on neurons by maintaining normal function and regulates apoptosis in Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. To find out the function of FtMt in neurodegenerative disease, we had a novel antibody made against human FtMt and characterized it via Western blot analysis, immunoabsorption testing, and double immunofluorescence histochemistry. Then we used this new FtMt antibody to map the distribution of FtMt in the monkey brainstem. We demonstrated widespread distribution of FtMt immunoreactivity throughout the monkey brainstem, with variable staining intensity. FtMt immunoreactivity was observed in the extrapyramidal system, sensory trigeminal nerve nuclei, some motor nuclei including ambiguous nucleus, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and hypoglossal nucleus, and some dorsal column nuclei such as the gracile nucleus and cuneate nucleus. In addition, double immunohistochemical stainings confirmed that FtMt immunoreactivity was co-localized with catecholaminergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (63.64%), substantia nigra pars compacta (69.18%), and ventral tegmental area (56.89%). The distribution of FtMt which we found in the brainstem implies possible involvement of FtMt in several physiological mechanisms, especially in the catecholaminergic neurons, and the possibility of significant involvement in neurodegenerative disease.

Kainic acid (KA) is a glutamate agonist widely used in studies of neurodegeneration due to its ability to induce excitotoxic damage in the rodent brain. Previously, we reported that pre-treatment with prolactin (PRL) prevents the neuron loss induced by KA administration in CA1, CA3 and CA4 of the hippocampus of the female rat. Here, we investigated if PRL has a neuroprotective effect in the dorsal hippocampus when it is administered after KA. For this, 100 ng of KA or 0.9% saline was administered intracerebroventricularly (ICV) to ovariectomized female rats. One hour later, they received subcutaneous PRL (103 μg/day for 7 days) or saline through an osmotic minipump. Also, to determine the hippocampal neurogenesis rate, the rats were administered bromodeoxyuridine along with the PRL treatment. Immunostaining for NeuN revealed that neuronal loss is lower in the CA1 of PRL-treated rats compared with the untreated group, but PRL did not confer any protection in the CA3 and CA4 subfields. Furthermore, PRL prevented the KA-induced cognitive deficit measured as a better performance in the novel object recognition test. The PRL treatment did not modify the neurogenesis rate. These data indicate that post-treatment with PRL confers differential neuroprotection against KA-induced neuronal loss in hippocampal subfield CA1, which correlates with a more mild cognitive deficit compared with the untreated control group.

AB  - Abstract
Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a potent vasodilator and a neuromodulator implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine. It binds to the extracellular domains of calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein (RAMP) 1 that together form the CGRP receptor. Antagonist antibodies against CGRP and its binding site at the receptor are clinically effective in preventing migraine attacks. The blood–brain barrier penetration of these antagonist antibodies is limited, suggesting that a potential peripheral site of action is sufficient to prevent migraine attacks. To further understand the sites of CGRP-mediated signaling in migraine, we used immunohistochemical staining with recently developed antagonist antibodies specifically recognizing a fusion protein of the extracellular domains of RAMP1 and CLR that comprise the CGRP binding pocket at the CGRP receptor in monkey and man. We confirmed binding of the antagonist antibodies to human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of dural meningeal arteries and neurons in the trigeminal ganglion, both of which are likely sites of action for therapeutic antibodies in migraine patients. We further used one of these antibodies for detailed mapping on cynomolgus monkey tissue and found antagonist antibody binding sites at multiple levels in the trigeminovascular system: in the dura mater VSMCs, in neurons and satellite glial cells in the trigeminal ganglion, and in neurons in the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis. These data reinforce and clarify our understanding of CGRP receptor localization in a pattern consistent with a role for CGRP receptors in trigeminal sensitization and migraine pathology.

Epidemiological investigations have shown that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. It has been indicated that the cholesterol concentration in the brain of AD patients is higher than that in normal people. In this study, we investigated the effects of cholesterol concentrations, 0, as the control, 3.125, 12.5, and 25 μM, on cholesterol metabolism, neuron survival, AD-related protein expressions, and cell morphology and apoptosis using SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. We observed that expressions of cholesterol hydroxylase (Cyp46), flotillin-2 (a marker of lipid raft content), and truncated tyrosine kinase B (TrkBtc) increased, while expressions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and full-length TrkB (TrkBfl) decreased as the concentration of cholesterol loading increased. Down-regulation of the PI3K-Akt-glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β cascade and cell apoptosis were also observed at higher concentrations of cholesterol, along with elevated levels of β-amyloid (Aβ), β-secretase (BACE), and reactive oxygen species (ROS). In conclusion, we found that cholesterol overload in neuronal cells imbalanced the cholesterol homeostasis and increased the protein expressions causing cell apoptosis, which illustrates the neurodegenerative pathology of abnormally elevated cholesterol concentrations found in AD patients.

AB  - Abstract
Role of striatal dopamine D1 receptors (D1Rs) in methamphetamine (Meth) taking and seeking is recognized from contingent Meth self-administration studies. For example, Meth increases levels of D1Rs in the dorsal striatum in animal models of Meth addiction, and blockade of striatal D1Rs decreased responding for Meth and reduced Meth priming-induced drug seeking. However, the mechanism underlying enhanced expression of striatal D1Rs in animals self-administering Meth is unknown and is hypothesized to involve maladaptive intracellular signal transduction mechanism via hyperphosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). D1Rs are predominantly localized to detergent-resistant membrane/lipid raft fractions (MLR fraction), and in vitro studies indicate that D1R signaling and recycling is regulated by the MLR-resident protein caveolin-1 (Cav-1), in an endocytotic-dependent manner. Notably, expression of Cav-1 is inversely regulated by ERK1/2 activation, suggesting a signaling interplay among D1Rs, ERK1/2 and Cav-1. We therefore evaluated the effects of extended access Meth self-administration on expression of striatal D1Rs, activated ERK1/2 and Cav-1. We first report that Cav-1 is heavily expressed in neurons located in the dorsal striatum. We also report that extended access Meth produces compulsive-like unregulated intake of the drug, and these behavioral outcomes are associated with enhanced expression of D1Rs, increased activity of ERK1/2, and reduced Cav-1 expression in the dorsal striatum. These data suggest a possible cellular mechanism that involves Cav-1 regulation of D1R expression in response to escalated Meth intake, and how this response of altered D1Rs and enhanced ERK1/2 activation to Meth self-administration contributes to contingent-related processes such as addiction.

AB  - Abstract
The Kölliker-Fuse (KF) region, located in the dorsolateral pons, projects to several brainstem areas involved in respiratory regulation, including the chemoreceptor neurons within the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN). Several lines of evidence indicate that the pontine KF region plays an important role in the control of the upper airways for the maintenance of appropriate airflow to and from the lungs. Specifically, we hypothesized that the KF region is involved in mediating the response of the hypoglossal motor activity to central respiratory chemoreflex activation and to stimulation of the chemoreceptor neurons within the RTN region. To test this hypothesis, we combined immunohistochemistry and physiological experiments. We found that in the KF, the majority of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA)-labeled axonal varicosities contained detectable levels of vesicular glutamate transporter-2 (VGLUT2), but few contained glutamic acid decarboxylase-67 (GAD67). The majority of the RTN neurons that were FluorGold (FG)-immunoreactive (i.e., projected to the KF) contained hypercapnia-induced Fos, but did not express tyrosine hydroxylase. In urethane-anesthetized sino-aortic denervated and vagotomized male Wistar rats, hypercapnia (10% CO2) or N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) injection (0.1 mM) in the RTN increased diaphragm (DiaEMG) and genioglossus muscle (GGEMG) activities and elicited abdominal (AbdEMG) activity. Bilateral injection of muscimol (GABA-A agonist; 2 mM) into the KF region reduced the increase in DiaEMG and GGEMG produced by hypercapnia or NMDA into the RTN. Our data suggest that activation of chemoreceptor neurons in the RTN produces a significant increase in the genioglossus muscle activity and the excitatory pathway is dependent on the neurons located in the dorsolateral pontine KF region.

AB  - Abstract
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1α) is a crucial neuronal regulator in the brain. However, its role in the spinal cord and the underlying regulating mechanisms remain poorly understood. Our previous study demonstrated that PGC-1α is significantly down-regulated following acute spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats. The current study aimed to explore the effects of PGC-1α overexpression on the injured spinal cord by establishing a contusive SCI model in adult Sprague–Dawley rats, followed by immediate intraspinal injection of lentiviral vectors at rostral and caudal sites 3 mm from the lesion epicenter. Hindlimb motor function was monitored using the Basso–Beattie–Bresnahan Locomotor Rating Scale (BBB scores), and cords were collected. Transfection efficiency analysis showed that lentivirus successfully induced enhanced PGC-1α expression. This resulted in attenuated apoptotic changes and a greater number of surviving spinal neurons, as determined by transmission electron microscopy and Nissl staining, respectively. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses revealed increased growth-associated protein 43 and 5-hydroxytryptamine expression, two key markers of axonal regeneration. Importantly, BBB scores showed improved hindlimb motor functional recovery. Moreover, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated significantly inhibited RhoA, ROCK1, and ROCK2 mRNA expression, revealing a potential mechanism of PGC-1α overexpression following traumatic SCI. Altogether, these results suggest that gene delivery of PGC-1α exerts a significant neuroprotective effect following traumatic SCI, which could serve as a promising treatment for repair of the injured cord, and RhoA–ROCK pathway inhibition may partially underlie this neuroprotection.

AB  - Abstract
Psychological studies have indicated that males exhibit stronger preferences for physical attributes in the opposite gender, such as facial attractiveness, than females. However, whether gender differences in mate preference originate from differential brain activity remains unclear. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated the patterns of brain activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a region critical for the valuation of faces, in response to elderly male, elderly female, young male, and young female faces. During fMRI, male and female subjects were presented with a face and asked to rate its pleasantness. Following fMRI, the subjects were presented with pairs of faces and asked to select the face that they preferred. We analyzed the vmPFC activity during the pleasantness-rating task according to the gender of the face stimulus (male and female) and the age of the face stimulus (elderly and young). Consistent with the results of previous studies, the vmPFC activity parametrically coded the subjective value of faces. Importantly, the vmPFC activity was sensitive to physical attributes, such as the youthfulness and gender of the faces, only in the male subjects. These findings provide a possible neural explanation for gender differences in mate preference.

AB  - Abstract
Absence seizures arise from disturbances within the corticothalamocortical network, however the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying seizure generation arising from different genetic backgrounds are not fully understood. While recent experimental evidence suggests that changes in inhibitory microcircuits in the cortex may contribute to generation of the hallmark spike-wave discharges, it is still unclear if altered cortical inhibition is a result of interneuron dysfunction due to compromised glutamatergic excitation and/or changes in cortical interneuron number. The stargazer mouse model of absence epilepsy presents with a genetic deficit in stargazin, which is predominantly expressed in cortical parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons, and involved in the trafficking of glutamatergic AMPA receptors. Hence, in this study we examine changes in (1) the subunit-specific expression of AMPA receptors which could potentially result in a loss of excitation onto cortical PV+ interneurons, and (2) PV+ neuron density that could additionally impair cortical inhibition. Using Western blot analysis we found subunit-specific alterations in AMPA receptor expression in the stargazer somatosensory cortex. Further analysis using confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that although there are no changes in cortical PV+ interneuron number, there is a predominant loss of GluA1 and 4 containing AMPA receptors in PV+ neurons in stargazers compared to non-epileptic controls. Taken together, these data suggest that the loss of AMPA receptors in PV+ neurons could impair their feed-forward inhibitory output, ultimately altering cortical network oscillations, and contribute to seizure generation in stargazers. As such the feed-forward inhibitory interneurons could be potential targets for future therapeutic intervention for some absence epilepsy patients.

AB  - Abstract
Spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 (SCA-3) is a rare disease but it is the most frequent type within the autosomal dominant inherited ataxias. The disease lacks an effective treatment to alleviate major symptoms and to modify disease progression. Our recent findings that endocannabinoid receptors and enzymes are significantly altered in the post-mortem cerebellum of patients affected by autosomal-dominant hereditary ataxias suggest that targeting the endocannabinoid signaling system may be a promising therapeutic option. Our goal was to investigate the status of the endocannabinoid signaling system in a transgenic mouse model of SCA-3, in the two CNS structures most affected in this disease – cerebellum and brainstem. These animals exhibited progressive motor incoordination, imbalance, abnormal gait, muscle weakness, and dystonia, in parallel to reduced in vivo brain glucose metabolism, deterioration of specific neuron subsets located in the dentate nucleus and pontine nuclei, small changes in microglial morphology, and reduction in glial glutamate transporters. Concerning the endocannabinoid signaling, our data indicated no changes in CB2 receptors. By contrast, CB1 receptors increased in the Purkinje cell layer, in particular in terminals of basket cells, but they were reduced in the dentate nucleus. We also measured the levels of endocannabinoid lipids and found reductions in anandamide and oleoylethanolamide in the brainstem. These changes correlated with an increase in the FAAH enzyme in the brainstem, which also occurred in some cerebellar areas, whereas other endocannabinoid-related enzymes were not altered. Collectively, our results in SCA-3 mutant mice confirm a possible dysregulation in the endocannabinoid system in the most important brain structures affected in this type of ataxia, suggesting that a pharmacological manipulation addressed to correct these changes could be a promising option in SCA-3.

AB  - Abstract
Regrowth inhibitory molecules prevent axon regeneration in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS). RhoA, a small GTPase in the Rho family, is a key intracellular switch that mediates the effects of these extracellular regrowth inhibitors. The bacterial enzyme C3-ADP ribosyltransferase (C3) selectively and irreversibly inhibits the activation of RhoA and stimulates axon outgrowth and regeneration. However, effective intracellular delivery of the C3 protein in vivo is limited by poor cell permeability and a short duration of action. To address this, we have developed a gene therapy approach using viral vectors to introduce the C3 gene into neurons or neuronal progenitors. Our vectors deliver C3 in a cell-autonomous (endogenous) or a cell-nonautonomous (secretable/permeable) fashion and promote in vitro process outgrowth on inhibitory chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan substrate. Further conditional control of our vectors was achieved via the addition of a Tet-On system, which allows for transcriptional control with doxycycline administration. These vectors will be crucial tools for promoting continued axonal regeneration after CNS injuries or neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Abstract
The efficacy of opioids in patients with chronic neuropathic pain remains controversial. Although activation of δ-opioid receptors (DORs) in the brainstem reduces inflammation-induced persistent hyperalgesia, it is not effective under persistent neuropathic pain conditions and these clinical problems remain largely unknown. In this study, by using a chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve in rats, we found that in the brainstem nucleus raphe magnus (NRM), DORs emerged on the surface membrane of central synaptic terminals on day 3 after CCI surgery and disappeared on day 14. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors microinjected into the NRM in vivo increased the level of synaptosomal DOR protein and NRM infusion of DOR agonists producing an antinociceptive effect in a nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling-dependent manner. In vitro, in CCI rat slices incubated with HDAC inhibitors, DOR agonists significantly inhibited EPSCs. This effect was blocked by tyrosine receptor kinase A antagonists. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that NRM infusion of HDAC inhibitors in CCI rats increased the level of histone H4 acetylation at Ngf gene promoter regions. NGF was infused into the NRM or incubated CCI rat slices drove DORs to the surface membrane of synaptic terminals. Taken together, epigenetic upregulation of NGF activity by HDAC inhibitors in the NRM promotes the trafficking of DORs to pain-modulating neuronal synapses under neuropathic pain conditions, leading to δ-opioid analgesia. These findings indicate that therapeutic use of DOR agonists combined with HDAC inhibitors might be effective in chronic neuropathic pain managements.

AB  - Abstract
Spinal lamina I projection neurons serve as a major conduit by which noxious stimuli detected in the periphery are transmitted to nociceptive circuits in the brain, including the parabrachial nucleus (PB) and the periaqueductal gray (PAG). While neonatal spino-PB neurons are more than twice as likely to exhibit spontaneous activity compared to spino-PAG neurons, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear since nothing is known about the voltage-independent (i.e. ‘leak’) ion channels expressed by these distinct populations during early life. To begin identifying these key leak conductances, the present study investigated the role of classical inward-rectifying K+ (Kir2) channels in the regulation of intrinsic excitability in neonatal rat spino-PB and spino-PAG neurons. The data demonstrate that a reduction in Kir2-mediated conductance by external BaCl2 significantly enhanced intrinsic membrane excitability in both groups. Similar results were observed in spino-PB neurons following Kir2 channel block with the selective antagonist ML133. In addition, voltage-clamp experiments showed that spino-PB and spino-PAG neurons express similar amounts of Kir2 current during the early postnatal period, suggesting that the differences in the prevalence of spontaneous activity between the two populations are not explained by differential expression of Kir2 channels. Overall, the results indicate that Kir2-mediated conductance tonically dampens the firing of multiple subpopulations of lamina I projection neurons during early life. Therefore, Kir2 channels are positioned to tightly shape the output of the immature spinal nociceptive circuit and thus regulate the ascending flow of nociceptive information to the developing brain, which has important functional implications for pediatric pain.

AB  - Abstract
Gut microbiota colonization is a key event for host physiology that occurs early in life. Disruption of this process leads to altered brain development which ultimately manifests as changes in brain function and behaviour in adulthood. Studies using germ-free (GF) mice highlight the extreme impact on brain health that results from life without commensal microbes. However, the impact of microbiota disturbances occurring in adulthood is less studied. To this end, we depleted the gut microbiota of 10-week-old male SpragueDawley rats via chronic antibiotic treatment. Following this marked, sustained depletion of the gut bacteria, we investigated behavioural and molecular hallmarks of gut-brain communication. Our results reveal that depletion of the gut microbiota during adulthood results in deficits in spatial memory as tested by Morris water maze, increased visceral sensitivity and a greater display of depressive-like behaviours in the forced swim test. In tandem with these clear behavioural alterations we found changes in altered CNS serotonin concentration along with changes in the mRNA levels of corticotrophin releasing hormone receptor 1 and glucocorticoid receptor. Additionally, we found changes in the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a hallmark of altered microbiota-gut-brain axis signalling. In summary, this model of antibiotic-induced depletion of the gut microbiota can be used for future studies interested in the impact of the gut microbiota on host health without the confounding developmental influence of early-life microbial alterations.

AB  - Abstract
To save energy, the European directives from the Eco-design of Energy Using Products (2005/32/CE) have recommended the replacement of incandescent lamps by more economic devices such as Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs). However, the emission spectrum of these devices is enriched in blue radiations, known to be potentially dangerous to the retina. Recent studies showed that light exposure contributes to the onset of early stages of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Here, we investigate, in albinos and pigmented rats, the effects of different exposure protocols. Twenty-four hours exposure at high luminance was compared to a cyclic (dark/light) exposure at domestic levels for 1 week and 1 month, using different LEDs (Cold-white, blue and green), as well as fluorocompact bulbs and fluorescent tubes. The data suggest that the blue component of the white-LED may cause retinal toxicity at occupational domestic illuminance and not only in extreme experimental conditions, as previously reported. It is important to note that the current regulations and standards have been established on the basis of acute light exposure and do not take into account the effects of repeated exposure.

AB  - Abstract
Consciousness has been linked to the repertoire of brain states at various spatiotemporal scales. Anesthesia is thought to modify consciousness by altering information integration in cortical and thalamocortical circuits. At a mesoscopic scale, neuronal populations in the cortex form synchronized ensembles whose characteristics are presumably state-dependent but this has not been rigorously tested. In this study, spontaneous neuronal activity was recorded with 64-contact microelectrode arrays in primary visual cortex of chronically instrumented, unrestrained rats under stepwise decreasing levels of desflurane anesthesia (8%, 6%, 4%, and 2% inhaled concentrations) and wakefulness (0% concentration). Negative phases of the local field potentials formed compact, spatially contiguous activity patterns (CAPs) that were not due to chance. The number of CAPs was 120% higher in wakefulness and deep anesthesia associated with burst-suppression than at intermediate levels of consciousness. The frequency distribution of CAP sizes followed a power–law with slope −1.5 in relatively deep anesthesia (8–6%) but deviated from that at the lighter levels. Temporal variance and entropy of CAP sizes were lowest in wakefulness (76% and 24% lower at 0% than at 8% desflurane, respectively) but changed little during recovery of consciousness. CAPs categorized by K-means clustering were conserved at all anesthesia levels and wakefulness, although their proportion changed in a state-dependent manner. These observations yield new knowledge about the dynamic landscape of ongoing population activity in sensory cortex at graded levels of anesthesia. The repertoire of population activity and self-organized criticality at the mesoscopic scale do not appear to contribute to anesthetic suppression of consciousness, which may instead depend on large-scale effects, more subtle dynamic properties, or changes outside of primary sensory cortex.

AB  - Abstract
The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a key role in higher functions such as memory and attention. In order to demonstrate sensory responses in the mPFC, we used electrophysiological recordings of urethane-anesthetized rats to record somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) or auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) elicited by whisker deflections and click stimulation, respectively. Contralateral whisker stimulation or auditory stimuli were also applied to study sensory interference in the mPFC. Interference with other sensory stimuli or recent stimulation history reduced whisker responses in the infralimbic and prelimbic cortices of the ventral mPFC. This effect could be mediated by activation of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons since the effect was blocked by the P/Q calcium channel antagonist ω-agatoxin. In contrast, sensory interference or the recent stimulation history was not detected by the dorsal mPFC or the primary somatosensory cortex. Results obtained from retrograde tracer injections in the dorsal and ventral regions of the mPFC indicated that somatosensory and auditory sensory inputs may arrive at the dorsal mPFC through secondary sensory cortical areas, and through the insular and temporal cortical areas. The ventral mPFC may receive sensory information through the strong anatomical connections between the dorsal and ventral mPFC areas. In conclusion, results suggest mPFC plays an important role in sensory processing, which may have important implications in attentional and memory processes.

Thrombin and activated protein C (aPC) bound to the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) both activate protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) generating either harmful or protective signaling respectively. In the present study we examined the localization of PAR-1 and EPCR and thrombin activity in Schwann glial cells of normal and crushed peripheral nerve and in Schwannoma cell lines. In the sciatic crush model nerves were excised 1 h, 1, 4, and 7 days after the injury. Schwannoma cell lines produced high levels of prothrombin which is converted to active thrombin and expressed both EPCR and PAR-1 which co-localized. In the injured sciatic nerve thrombin levels were elevated as early as 1 h after injury, reached their peak 1 day after injury which was significantly higher (24.4 ± 4.1 mU/ml) compared to contralateral uninjured nerves (2.6 ± 7 mU/ml, t-test p &lt; 0.001) and declined linearly reaching baseline levels by day 7. EPCR was found to be located at the microvilli of Schwann cells at the node of Ranvier and in cytoplasm surrounding the nucleus. Four days after sciatic injury, EPCR levels increased significantly (57,785 ± 16602AU versus 4790 ± 1294AU in the contralateral uninjured nerves, p &lt; 0.001 by t-test) mainly distal to the site of injury, where axon degeneration is followed by proliferation of Schwann cells which are diffusely stained for EPCR. EPCR seems to be located to cytoplasmic component of Schwann cells and not to compact myelin component, and is highly increased following injury.

AB  - Abstract
We investigated hemispheric asymmetries in categorization of face gender by means of a divided visual field paradigm, in which female and male faces were presented unilaterally for 150 ms each. A group of 60 healthy participants (30 males) and a male split-brain patient (D.D.C.) were asked to categorize the gender of the stimuli. Healthy participants categorized male faces presented in the right visual field (RVF) better and faster than when presented in the left visual field (LVF), and female faces presented in the LVF than in the RVF, independently of the participants’ sex. Surprisingly, the recognition rates of D.D.C. were at chance levels – and significantly lower than those of the healthy participants – for both female and male faces presented in the RVF, as well as for female faces presented in the LVF. His performance was higher than expected by chance – and did not differ from controls – only for male faces presented in the LVF. The residual right-hemispheric ability of the split-brain patient in categorizing male faces reveals an own-gender bias lateralized in the right hemisphere, in line with the rightward own-identity and own-age bias previously shown in split-brain patients. The gender-contingent hemispheric dominance found in healthy participants confirms the previously shown right-hemispheric superiority in recognizing female faces, and also reveals a left-hemispheric superiority in recognizing male faces, adding an important evidence of hemispheric imbalance in the field of face and gender perception.

AB  - Abstract
Experiments on the adult visual cortex of cats, ferrets and monkeys have revealed organized spatial relationships between multiple feature maps which can also be reproduced by the Kohonen and elastic net self-organization models. However, attempts to apply these models to simulate the temporal kinetics of monocular deprivation (MD) during the critical period, and their effects on the spatial arrangement of feature maps, have led to conflicting results. In this study, we performed MD and chronic imaging in the ferret visual cortex during the critical period of ocular dominance (OD) plasticity. We also used the Kohonen model to simulate the effects of MD on OD and orientation map development. Both the experiments and simulations demonstrated two general parameter-insensitive findings. Specifically, our first finding demonstrated that the OD index shift resulting from MD, and its subsequent recovery during binocular vision (BV), were both nonlinear, with a significantly stronger shift occurring during the initial period. Meanwhile, spatial reorganization of feature maps led to globally unchanged but locally shifted map patterns. In detail, we found that the periodicity of OD and orientation maps remained unchanged during, and after, deprivation. Relationships between OD and orientation maps remained similar but were significantly weakened due to OD border shifts. These results indicate that orthogonal gradient relationships between maps may be preset and are only mildly modifiable during the critical period. The Kohonen model was able to reproduce these experimental results, hence its role is further extended to the description of cortical feature map dynamics during development.

AB  - Abstract
Muscle fatigue modifies the gain between motor command magnitude and the mechanical muscular response. In other words, post-fatigue, central drives to the muscles must increase to maintain a particular submaximum mechanical output. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that this modified gain can be predicted by the central nervous system (CNS) during discrete ballistic movements. In two separate experiments, subjects were required to perform shoulder flexions in standing and sitting positions at submaximum target peak accelerations. They were assisted with visual feedback informing them on their performance after each trial. Shoulder flexions were performed before and after fatiguing protocols of the focal muscles. Acceleration signals, focal and postural muscle electromyograms (EMGs) were recorded. The results demonstrated that participants were able to reach with precision the target acceleration during the first movements post-fatigue at the cost of significant increase in focal motor command magnitude. Decreased variance of peak accelerations associated with increased focal command variability was observed post-fatigue. During the standing experiment, postural muscle EMGs revealed that anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) scaled to focal movement acceleration post-fatigue. All these results support that fatigue effects are taken into account during movement planning. Indeed, given that no feedback could enable participants to adjust acceleration during movement, this capacity to anticipate fatigue effects is the exclusive result of feedforward processes. To account for this prediction capacity, we discuss the role of fatigue-related modifications in sensory inputs from the working muscles.

AB  - Abstract
Non-medical use of amphetamine (AMPH) among adolescents is prevalent, which is problematic given the potential consequences of developmental drug exposure on brain function and behavior. Previously we found in adult male rats that AMPH exposure starting before puberty induces a persistent decrease in dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) function in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Here we investigated if this dysfunction was associated with changes in D1R expression in the mPFC and nucleus accumbens (NAc). We also determined if starting drug exposure well before or near the onset of puberty would influence AMPH-induced changes in D1R expression and behavior. Male and female Sprague–Dawley rats were treated once every other day (10 injections total) with saline or 3 mg/kg AMPH (i.p.) from either postnatal day (P) 27 to 45 (pre-puberty groups; Pre-P) or P37 to 55 (peri-puberty groups; Peri-P). After 1, 7 and 21 days of withdrawal, sucrose preference tests were performed to assess anhedonia. Exploratory behavior was studied in an open-field arena and on an elevated plus maze (EPM). Rats were then sacrificed for Western blot analysis of D1R expression. We found that AMPH withdrawal induced decreases in sucrose preference that persisted in rats with Peri-P onset treatment. Pre-P onset AMPH exposure led to increased open-arm exploration in the EPM test, as well as a decreased D1R level in the mPFC but not NAc. Our results demonstrated that AMPH exposure starting at different developmental stages resulted in distinct neurobehavioral abnormalities, suggesting an important role of exposure timing in drug-induced plasticity.

AB  - Abstract
This study sought to determine the effects of chronic low back pain (LBP) on the cortical evoked potentials, muscle activation, and kinematics of postural responses to perturbations of standing balance. Thirteen subjects with chronic, recurrent, non-specific LBP and 13 subjects without LBP participated. The subjects responded to unpredictably timed postural perturbations while standing on a platform that randomly rotated either “toes up” or “toes down”. Electroencephalography (EEG) was used to calculate the negative peak (N1) and subsequent positive peak (P2) amplitudes of the perturbation-evoked cortical potentials. Passive-marker motion capture was used to calculate joint and center-of-mass (CoM) displacements. Surface electromyography was used to record muscle onset latencies. Questionnaires assessed pain, interference with activity, fear of activity, and pain catastrophizing. Results demonstrated that subjects with LBP exhibited significantly larger P2 potentials, delayed erector spinae, rectus abdominae, and external oblique onset latencies, as well as smaller trunk extension yet larger trunk flexion, knee flexion, and ankle dorsiflexion displacements compared to subjects without LBP. For the subjects with LBP, CoM displacements significantly and positively correlated with knee displacements as well as activity interference and fear scores. The P2 potentials significantly and negatively correlated with CoM displacements as well as activity interference, catastrophizing, and fear scores. These results demonstrate that people with LBP exhibit altered late-phase cortical processing of postural perturbations concomitant with altered kinematic and muscle responses, and these cortical and postural response characteristics correlate with each other as well as with clinical reports of pain-related fears and activity interference.

AB  - Abstract
Motor map reorganization is believed to be one mechanism underlying rehabilitation-induced functional recovery. Although the ipsilesional secondary motor area has been known to reorganize motor maps and contribute to rehabilitation-induced functional recovery, it is unknown how the secondary motor area is reorganized by rehabilitative training. In the present study, using skilled forelimb reaching tasks, we investigated neural network remodeling in the rat rostral forelimb area (RFA) of the secondary motor area during 4 weeks of rehabilitative training. Following photothrombotic stroke in the caudal forelimb area (CFA), rehabilitative training led to task-specific recovery and motor map reorganization in the RFA. A second injury to the RFA resulted in reappearance of motor deficits. Further, when both the CFA and RFA were destroyed simultaneously, rehabilitative training no longer improved task-specific recovery. In neural tracer studies, although rehabilitative training did not alter neural projection to the RFA from other brain areas, rehabilitative training increased neural projection from the RFA to the lower spinal cord, which innervates the muscles in the forelimb. Double retrograde tracer studies revealed that rehabilitative training increased the neurons projecting from the RFA to both the upper cervical cord, which innervates the muscles in the neck, trunk, and part of the proximal forelimb, and the lower cervical cord. These results suggest that neurons projecting to the upper cervical cord provide new connections to the denervated forelimb area of the spinal cord, and these new connections may contribute to rehabilitation-induced task-specific recovery and motor map reorganization in the secondary motor area.

AB  - Abstract
There are no effective neuroprotectant drugs for acute cerebral ischemia. Serine racemase (SR) synthesizes d-serine, which is involved in N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-induced neurotoxicity. Recently, SR deletion was reported to protect against focal cerebral ischemia. However, regulatory mechanisms controlling SR-activity in the neurovascular unit (NVU) during cerebral ischemia remain to be clarified. We investigated the effects of SR inhibition on neurovascular protection after ischemia. The SR inhibitor phenazine methosulfate (PMS) alleviated neuronal damage in an ex vivo ischemic model (oxygen glucose deprivation [OGD]) using primary neuronal cultures, and in an in vivo mouse model of ischemia (middle cerebral artery occlusion [MCAO]). Ischemic preconditioning (IP) and PMS-treatment inhibited SR phosphorylation after ischemia ex vivo. In addition, SR phosphorylation after MCAO was also decreased in PMS-treated mice. Reductions in regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) after MCAO were improved by administration of PMS. Treatment with PMS increased phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the ischemic core and penumbra region. In neuron-endothelial cell co-cultures, PMS promoted nitric oxide production after OGD. These findings indicate that SR inhibition acts as a neuroprotectant in the NVU and ameliorant of CBF abnormalities post-stroke. Thus, pharmacologic SR inhibition has potential clinical applications.

AB  - Abstract
Zinc is a central actor in regulating stem cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the adult brain. High levels of vesicular zinc are found in the presynaptic terminals. It has been demonstrated that high levels of vesicular zinc are localized in the presynaptic terminals of the granule cells of the dentate gyrus (DG) and that neurogenesis occurs in the subgranular zone (SGZ). Furthermore, zinc chelation reduces hippocampal neurogenesis in pathological conditions such as hypoglycemia, epilepsy and traumatic brain injury. Here we test the effects of zinc plus cyclo-(His-Pro) (CHP) treatment on neurogenesis in the adult SGZ. In order to increase brain zinc, Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats, aged 5 weeks, were given zinc plus CHP (ZC, 27 mg/kg) orally available once per day for 2 weeks. BrdU was intraperitoneally injected 2 times per day for 4 consecutive days starting 1 week after initial ZC treatment. Neurogenesis was analyzed by BrdU, Ki67 and doublecortin (DCX) immunostaining. The number of progenitor cells and immature neurons were significantly increased in the DG following 2 weeks of ZC treatment. Hippocampal vesicular zinc content was evaluated with TSQ staining. Vesicular TSQ fluorescent intensity was seen to increase in the mossy fiber area at 2 weeks after ZC treatment. The present study demonstrates that zinc supplementation by ZC treatment increases hippocampal neurogenesis and levels of vesicular zinc. These findings provide evidence in support of the essential role of zinc in modulating hippocampal neurogenesis.

AB  - Abstract
TAK-063 is a selective phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) inhibitor that produces potent antipsychotic-like and pro-cognitive effects at 0.3 mg/kg (26% PDE10A occupancy in rats) or higher in rodents through the balanced activation of the direct and indirect pathways of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). In this study, we evaluated the specific binding of TAK-063 using in vitro autoradiography (ARG) and the modulation of brain activity using pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). [3H]TAK-063 significantly accumulated in the caudate—putamen (CPu), ventral pallidum (VP), substantia nigra (SN), hippocampus (Hipp), and amygdala (Amy), but not in the frontal cortex (Fcx), brainstem (Bs), or cerebellum (Cb) in an ARG study using rat brain sections. [3H]TAK-063 accumulation in the CPu was more than eighteen-fold higher than that in the Hipp and Amy. TAK-063 at 0.3 mg/kg increased the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the striatum and Amy, and decreased it in the Fcx in a phMRI study with anesthetized rats. TAK-063 at 0.3 mg/kg significantly reduced the ketamine-induced increase in EEG gamma power both in awake and anesthetized rats. TAK-063 at 0.2 mg/kg (35% PDE10A occupancy in monkeys) also reduced the ketamine-induced increase in EEG gamma power in awake monkeys. In line with the EEG data, TAK-063 at 0.3 mg/kg reversed the ketamine-induced BOLD signal changes in the cortex, Bs, and Cb in a phMRI study with anesthetized rats. These data suggest that TAK-063 at about 30% PDE10A occupancy modulates activities of multiple brain regions through activation of neuronal circuits in rats and monkeys.

AB  - Abstract
In quadrupeds, acute lateral hemisection of the spinal cord (LHS) severely impairs postural functions, which recover over time. Postural limb reflexes (PLRs) represent a substantial component of postural corrections in intact animals. The aim of the present study was to characterize the effects of acute LHS on two populations of spinal neurons (F and E) mediating PLRs. For this purpose, in decerebrate rabbits, responses of individual neurons from L5 to stimulation causing PLRs were recorded before and during reversible LHS (caused by temporal cold block of signal transmission in lateral spinal pathways at L1), as well as after acute surgical LHS at L1. Results obtained after Sur-LHS were compared to control data obtained in our previous study.

We found that acute LHS caused disappearance of PLRs on the affected side. It also changed a proportion of different types of neurons on that side. A significant decrease and increase in the proportion of F- and non-modulated neurons, respectively, was found. LHS caused a significant decrease in most parameters of activity in F-neurons located in the ventral horn on the lesioned side and in E-neurons of the dorsal horn on both sides. These changes were caused by a significant decrease in the efficacy of posture-related sensory input from the ipsilateral limb to F-neurons, and from the contralateral limb to both F- and E-neurons. These distortions in operation of postural networks underlie the impairment of postural control after acute LHS, and represent a starting point for the subsequent recovery of postural functions.

AB  - Abstract
How gravity influences neural control of arm movements remains under debate. We tested three alternative interpretations suggested by previous research: (1) that muscular control includes two components, tonic which compensates for gravity and phasic which produces the movement; (2) that there is a tendency to exploit gravity to reduce muscle effort; and (3) that there is a tendency to use a trailing pattern of joint control during which either the shoulder or elbow is rotated actively and the other joint rotates predominantly passively, and to exploit gravity for control of the passively rotated joint. A free-stroke drawing task was performed that required production of center-out strokes within a circle while selecting stroke directions randomly. The circle was positioned in the horizontal, sagittal, and frontal plane. The arm joints freely rotated in space. In each plane, the distribution of the strokes across directions was non-uniform. Directional histograms were built and their peaks were used to identify preferred movement directions. The directional preferences were especially pronounced in the two vertical planes. The upward directions were most preferred. To test the three interpretations, we used a kinetic analysis that determined the role of gravitational torque in the production of movement in the preferred directions. The results supported the third interpretation and provided evidence against the first and second interpretation. The trailing pattern has been associated with reduced neural effort for joint coordination, and therefore, we conclude that the major tendency with respect to gravity is to exploit it for simplification of joint coordination.

AB  - Abstract
A subpopulation of olivary pretectal nucleus (OPN) neurons fire action potentials in a rhythmic manner with an eruption of activity occurring approximately every two minutes. These infra-slow oscillations depend critically on functional retinal input and are subject to modulation by light. Interestingly, the activity of photoreceptors is necessary for the emergence of the rhythm and while classic photoreceptors (rods and cones) are necessary in darkness and dim light, melanopsin photoreceptors are indispensable in bright light. Using pharmacological and electrophysiological approaches in vivo, we show that also blocking retinal gap junctions (GJs), which are expressed by multitude of retinal cells, leads to the disruption of oscillatory activity in the rat OPN. Intravitreal injection of carbenoxolone (CBX) quenched oscillations in a concentration-dependent manner with 1 mM being ineffective, 5 mM showing partial and 20 mM showing complete effectiveness in disrupting oscillations. Moreover, the most effective CBX concentration depressed cone-mediated light-induced responses of oscillatory neurons suggesting that CBX is also acting on targets other than GJs. In contrast, intravitreal injection of meclofenamic acid (MFA, 20 mM) led to disruption of the rhythm but did not interfere with cone-mediated light-induced responses of oscillatory neurons, implying that MFA is more specific toward GJs than CBX, as suggested before. We conclude that electrical coupling between various types of retinal cells and resultant synchronous firing of retinal ganglion cells is necessary for the generation of infra-slow oscillations in the rat OPN.

AB  - Abstract
We previously showed that magnesium sulfate (MS) has systemic antinociceptive and local peripheral pronociceptive effects. The role of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) in the mechanism of action of MS has not been investigated in detail. The aim of this study was to explore the participation of TRP channels in the pronociceptive action of MS in rats after its intraplantar injection. The paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) to mechanical stimuli was measured by the electronic von Frey test. Drugs that were tested were either co-administered with an isotonic pH-unadjusted or pH-adjusted solution of MS intraplantarily, or to the contralateral paw to exclude systemic effects. We found that the subcutaneous administration of both pH-adjusted (7.4) and pH-unadjusted (about 6.0) isotonic (6.2% w/v in water) solutions of MS induce the pain at the injection site. The pH-unadjusted MS solution-induced mechanical hyperalgesia decreased in a dose-dependent manner as a consequence of co-injection of capsazepine, a selective TRPV1 antagonist (20, 100 and 500 pmol/paw), RN-1734, a selective TRPV4 antagonist (1.55, 3.1 and 6.2 μmol/paw), HC-030031, a selective TRPA1 antagonist (5.6, 28.1 and 140 nmol/paw), and amiloride hydrochloride, a non-selective ASIC inhibitor (0.83, 2.5 and 7.55 μmol/paw). In pH-adjusted MS-induced hyperalgesia, the highest doses of TRPV1, TRPV4 and TRPA1 antagonists displayed effects that were, respectively, either similar, less pronounced or delayed in comparison to the effect induced by administration of the pH-unadjusted MS solution; the ASIC antagonist did not have any effect. These results suggest that the MS-induced local peripheral mechanical hyperalgesia is mediated via modulation of the activity of peripheral TRPV1, TRPV4, TRPA1 and ASICs. Specific local inhibition of TRP channels represents a novel approach to treating local injection-related pain.

AB  - Abstract
Reactive astrocytosis and the subsequent glial scar is ubiquitous to injuries of the central nervous system, especially spinal cord injury (SCI) and primarily serves to protect against further damage, but is also a prominent inhibitor of regeneration. Manipulating the glial scar by targeting chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) has been the focus of much study as a means to improve axon regeneration and subsequently functional recovery. In this study we investigate the ability of small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivered by a non-viral polymer vector to silence the rate-limiting enzyme involved in CSPG synthesis. Gene expression of this enzyme, xylosyltransferase-1, was silenced by 65% in Neu7 astrocytes which conferred a reduced expression of CSPGs. Furthermore, conditioned medium taken from treated Neu7s, or co-culture experiments with dorsal root ganglia (DRG) showed that siRNA treatment resulted in a more permissive environment for DRG neurite outgrowth than treatment with chondroitinase ABC alone. These results indicate that there is a role for targeted siRNA therapy using polymeric vectors to facilitate regeneration of injured axons following central nervous system injury.

AB  - Abstract
The frequency of intrusive saccades during maintenance of active visual fixation has been used as a measure of sustained visual attention in studies of healthy subjects as well as of neuropsychiatric patient populations. In this study, the mechanism that generates intrusive saccades during active visual fixation was investigated in a population of young healthy men performing three sustained fixation tasks (fixation to a visual target, fixation to a visual target with visual distracters, and fixation straight ahead in the dark). Markov Chain modeling of inter-saccade intervals (ISIs) was utilized. First- and second-order Markov modeling provided indications for the existence of a non-random pattern in the production of intrusive saccades. Accordingly, the system of intrusive saccade generation may operate in two “attractor” states, one in which intrusive saccades occur at short consecutive ISIs and another in which intrusive saccades occur at long consecutive ISIs. These states might correspond to two distinct states of the attention system, one of low focused – high distractibility and another of high focused – low distractibility, such as those proposed in the adaptive gain theory for the control of attention by the noradrenergic system in the brain. To the authors knowledge, this is the first time that Markov Chain modeling has been applied to the analysis of the ISIs of intrusive saccades.

AB  - Abstract
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)-based genotyping using microarray platform is now frequently used to detect copy number variants (CNVs) in the human genome. Here, we report CNVs identified using Illumina Human Omni 2.5 M oligonucleotide microarrays in 11 multiplex families with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) referred to Autism Research and Treatment Center (ART) and Madinah Maternity and Children Hospital (MMCH). Of the 11 families, 22 patients with ASD (all males) and their parents, were recruited for the present study. In total, 43 individuals were genotyped with high-resolution array. Abnormal microarray results were seen in all 22 patients with ASD. A total of 17 shared CNVs were selected for further analysis. Out of these 17 CNVs, we discovered one novel CNV, previously not described, and 16 recurrent CNVs that overlap with the genomic imbalances defined in the autism database, autism chromosome rearrangement database and database of genomic variants. Recurrent CNVs include 11 common and 5 rare CNVs. All rare CNVs are duplications except a 16-kb deletion on chr2q36.3. Rare gain of copy numbers includes a 2-kb duplication on chr9q21.13, overlapping duplications of 107 kb and 181 kb on chrXp22.33 in 2 different families and a 10-kb duplication on chr18q21.13. A novel loss of copy number on chr3q23 was found in four ASD cases. This CNV results in deletion of intron 2 of calsyntenin 2 (CLSTN2) encoding synaptic protein calsyntenin 2. CLSTN2 is expressed exclusively in the brain, with high levels occurring in cortical gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons and in medial temporal lobe regions. These results verify the diagnostic relevance of genome-wide small common and rare CNVs and provide further evidence of the high diagnostic yield of microarray for genetic testing in children with ASD.

AB  - Abstract
The insular cortex (IC) plays a principal role in the regulation of pain processing. Although opioidergic agonists depress cortical excitatory synaptic transmission, little is known about opioidergic roles in inhibitory synaptic transmission. In the IC, the opioid receptors differentially regulate the excitatory propagation: agonists of the mu (MOR), delta (DOR), and kappa (KOR) exhibit suppressive, facilitative, and little effects, respectively. Thus, we aimed to examine the effects of opioid receptor agonists on unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents (uIPSCs) in the IC. Pyramidal and GABAergic neurons in the rat IC were recorded by a multiple whole-cell patch-clamp technique. [D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]-Enkephalin acetate salt (DAMGO), an MOR agonist, reduced uIPSC amplitude by 74% in fast-spiking GABAergic interneuron (FS)→FS connections without a significant effect on FS→pyramidal cell (Pyr) connections. These effects of DAMGO were also observed in non-FS→FS and non-FS→Pyr connections: DAMGO reduced the uIPSC amplitude in non-FS→FS but not in non-FS→Pyr connections. DAMGO-induced depression of uIPSCs was blocked by the MOR antagonist, D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2. The DOR agonist, [D-Pen2,5]-Enkephalin hydrate (DPDPE), reduced uIPSC amplitude by 39% in FS→FS and by 49% in FS→Pyr connections, which was antagonized by the DOR antagonist, naltrindole. However, DPDPE had little effect on non-FS→FS/Pyr connections. (±)-trans-U-50488 methanesulfonate salt (U50488), a KOR agonist, had little effect on uIPSC in FS→FS/Pyr connections. These results suggest that MOR-induced uIPSC depression in FS→FS and non-FS→FS, but not FS→Pyr and non-FS→Pyr connections, results in the depression of excitatory propagation in the IC, which may be an underlying mechanism of the powerful analgesic effects of MOR agonists.

AB  - Abstract
It is known that anxiety (ANX) impairs action–perception coupling. This study tests whether this impairment could be associated with an alteration of the sensorimotor function. To this aim, the cortical activities underlying the sensorimotor function were recorded in twelve volunteers in a reach-to-grasp paradigm, in which the level of ANX and the position of a glass were manipulated. The experimental manipulation of the ANX-related somatosensory state was expected to prompt participants to underestimate their reaching-to-grasp capabilities while the sensorimotor-related oscillatory brain activities around the 6-Hz (θ) frequency over motor-related and parietal regions were expected to be modulated. We also investigated the oscillatory brain dynamics around the 11.5-Hz (fast-α) frequency as a neural hallmark of ANX manipulation induced by the breath-restriction. Results indeed showed that participants underestimated their reaching-to-grasp maximal performance. Concomittantly, θ-EEG synchronization over the motor cortex contralateral to the dominant hand was higher during glass presentation under breath-restriction condition (+20.1%; p &lt; 0.05), and when the glass was perceived as non-reachable (+20.0%; p &lt; 0.05). Fast-α-EEG desynchronization was reduced under breath-restriction (−37.7%; p &lt; 0.05). The results confirm that ANX-related impairment of action–perception coupling co-modulates with theta-sensorimotor rhythm. This finding is discussed as an altered “readiness state” in the reaching-related cortical network, while individuals are anxious.

AB  - Abstract
The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis undergoes critical developments during adolescence. Therefore, stressors experienced during this period potentially have long-term effects on adult HPA axis function. We hypothesized that adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure would affect adult HPA axis function, resulting in altered responses to an alcohol challenge in young adults or adults. To test these hypotheses, male rats were exposed to alcohol vapor for 6 h per day from post-natal day (PND) 28–42, then acutely challenged with alcohol intragastrically (3.2–4.5 g/kg) in young adults (PND 70) or adults (PND 90). Overall, we observed blunted HPA axis responses to an alcohol challenge due to AIE exposure. Specifically, AIE tended to inhibit the alcohol challenge-induced increase in plasma corticosterone (CORT) concentrations in young adult and adult rats. As well, AIE significantly blunted the alcohol challenge-induced arginine vasopressin (Avp) mRNA expression in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus of adult rats. Results of the present study are similar to what we have previously shown, that these changes in PVN responsiveness may result from AIE-induced alterations in adrenergic neurons in brain stem regions C1–C3 known to project to the PVN. AIE elevated the number of colocalized c-fos/phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT)-positive cell bodies in the C1 region of adult rats. Together, these data suggest that AIE exposure produces alterations in male HPA axis responsiveness to administration of an acute alcohol challenge that may be long-lasting.

AB  - Abstract
Traumatic events contribute to a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Identifying the neural mechanisms that affect the stress response may improve treatment for stress-related disorders. Neurogenesis, the production of neurons, occurs within the adult brain and disturbances in neurogenesis in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus have been linked to mood and anxiety disorders. Chronic stress models have mainly suggested correlations with stress reducing adult SGZ neurogenesis, whereas acute stress models and those with a naturalistic component that are also associated with long-lasting behavioral changes have produced inconsistent results. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to examine the effects of acute predator stress on adult neurogenesis. Predator stress involved a single 10-min unprotected rat to cat exposure that has previously been shown to produce contextual fear, hyperarousal, and anxiety-like behavior lasting at least 3 weeks. As expected, predator stress produced a stress response as detected by elevated corticosterone (CORT) levels immediately after stress. Despite this robust stress response, there was no significant difference between stressed and handled control rats in the number of proliferating or surviving cells as assessed by a 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine-immunoreactive (BrdU-IR) labeling 2 h or 4 weeks post-stress throughout the rostro-caudal axis of the SGZ, respectively. Additionally, 90% of 4-week-old BrdU-IR cells in both conditions expressed NeuN, suggesting no change in cell fate with stress exposure. Overall, these data give caution to the notion that acute predator stress can alter the production or survival of adult-generated cells.

AB  - Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a gradual loss of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) during aging. 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is one of the neurotoxins used widely to induce PD-like symptoms in PD animal models, including rodents and non-human primates. It has been reported that deletion of autophagy-related gene 7 (Atg7) in the brain results in a reduction of mDA neurons in adulthood. In this study, we used tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-Cre mice to generate conditional knockout (CKO) mice with the specific deletion of Atg7 in mDA neurons. Consistent with previous reports, adult Atg7 CKO mice contained fewer TH-positive mDA neurons compared with wild-type (WT) controls. TH-expressing neurons containing puncta-like structures with p62 and ubiquitin immunoreactivity were observed in the midbrain of Atg7 CKO mice but were not detected in control mice. However, MPTP-induced loss of mDA neurons was not observed in Atg7 CKO mice. Our results indicate that Atg7-involved autophagy is required not only for the survival of mDA neurons in the mouse brain, but also for MPTP-induced mDA neuron degeneration.

AB  - Abstract
The mesolimbic dopamine and opioid systems are postulated to influence the central control of physical activity motivation. We utilized selectively bred rats for high (HVR) or low (LVR) voluntary running behavior to examine (1) inherent differences in mu-opioid receptor (Oprm1) expression and function in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), (2) if dopamine-related mRNAs, wheel-running, and food intake are differently influenced by intraperitoneal (i.p.) naltrexone injection in HVR and LVR rats, and (3) if dopamine is required for naltrexone-induced changes in running and feeding behavior in HVR rats. Oprm1 mRNA and protein expression were greater in the NAc of HVR rats, and application of the Oprm1 agonist [D-Ala2, N-MePhe4, Gly-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) to dissociated NAc neurons produced greater depolarizing responses in neurons from HVR versus LVR rats. Naltrexone injection dose-dependently decreased wheel running and food intake in HVR, but not LVR, rats. Naltrexone (20 mg/kg) decreased tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA in the ventral tegmental area and Fos and Drd5 mRNA in NAc shell of HVR, but not LVR, rats. Additionally, lesion of dopaminergic neurons in the NAc with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) ablated the decrease in running, but not food intake, in HVR rats following i.p. naltrexone administration. Collectively, these data suggest the higher levels of running observed in HVR rats, compared to LVR rats, are mediated, in part, by increased mesolimbic opioidergic signaling that requires downstream dopaminergic activity to influence voluntary running, but not food intake.

AB  - Abstract
Face-recognition deficits, referred to with the term prosopagnosia (i.e., face blindness), may manifest during development in the absence of any brain injury (from here the term congenital prosopagnosia, CP). It has been estimated that approximately 2.5% of the population is affected by face-processing deficits not depending on brain lesions, and varying a lot in severity. The genetic bases of this disorder are not known. In this study we tested for genetic association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) and CP in a restricted cohort of Italian participants. We found evidence of an association between the common genetic variants rs53576 and rs2254298 OXTR SNPs and prosopagnosia. This association was also found when including an additional group of German individuals classified as prosopagnosic in the analysis. Our preliminary data provide initial support for the involvement of genetic variants of OXTR in a relevant cognitive impairment, whose genetic bases are still largely unexplored.

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can increase cortical excitability of a targeted brain area, which may affect endurance exercise performance. However, optimal electrode placement for tDCS remains unclear. We tested the effect of two different tDCS electrode montages for improving exercise performance. Nine subjects underwent a control (CON), placebo (SHAM) and two different tDCS montage sessions in a randomized design. In one tDCS session, the anodal electrode was placed over the left motor cortex and the cathodal on contralateral forehead (HEAD), while for the other montage the anodal electrode was placed over the left motor cortex and cathodal electrode above the shoulder (SHOULDER). tDCS was delivered for 10 min at 2.0 mA, after which participants performed an isometric time to exhaustion (TTE) test of the right knee extensors. Peripheral and central neuromuscular parameters were assessed at baseline, after tDCS application and after TTE. Heart rate (HR), ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), and leg muscle exercise-induced muscle pain (PAIN) were monitored during the TTE. TTE was longer and RPE lower in the SHOULDER condition (P &lt; 0.05). Central and peripheral parameters, and HR and PAIN did not present any differences between conditions after tDCS stimulation (P &gt; 0.05). In all conditions maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) significantly decreased after the TTE (P &lt; 0.05) while motor-evoked potential area (MEP) increased after TTE (P &lt; 0.05). These findings demonstrate that SHOULDER montage is more effective than HEAD montage to improve endurance performance, likely through avoiding the negative effects of the cathode on excitability.

AB  - Abstract
The mechanism underlying neuropathic pain (NP) is complex and has not been fully elucidated. The TWIK-related spinal cord K+ (TRESK) is the major background potassium current in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), we found that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal pathway were activated in spinal cord accompanied by TRESK down regulation in response to NP. Therefore, we investigated whether TRESK mediates inflammation and apoptosis by MAPK pathway in the spinal cord of NP rats. SNI rats exhibited reduced TRESK expression in DRG and spinal cord and higher sensitivity to mechanical stimuli but no effect on thermal stimuli. Intrathecal injections of TRESK overexpressing adenovirus alleviated mechanical allodynia, inhibited phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38, and decreased inflammatory reactions and apoptosis in the spinal cords of SNI rats. Down regulation of TRESK in DRG and spinal cord was detected in normal rats after intrathecal TRESK shRNA lentivirus injection, which induced mechanical allodynia but had no effect on pain thresholds for heat stimulation. Phosphorylated ERK and p38 were increased in the spinal cord. Intrathecal injection of an ERK antagonist (PD98059) and p38 antagonist (SB203580) prevented ERK and p38 activation in the spinal cord and mechanical allodynia induced by TRESK shRNA lentivirus. In conclusion, our study clearly demonstrated an important role for TRESK in NP and that TRESK regulation contributes to pain sensitivity mediates inflammation and apoptosis by ERK and p38 MAPK signaling in the spinal cord.

AB  - Abstract
The sodium bicarbonate co-transporter (NBC) is the major bicarbonate-dependent acid–base transporter in mammalian astrocytes and has been implicated in ischemic brain injury. A malfunction of astrocytes could have great impact on the outcome of stroke due to their participation in the formation of blood-brain barrier, synaptic transmission, and electrolyte balance in the human brain. Nevertheless, the role of NBC in the ischemic astrocyte death has not been well understood. In this work, we obtained skin biopsies from healthy human subjects and had their fibroblasts grown in culture and reprogrammed into human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). These hiPSCs were further differentiated into neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs) and then into human astrocytes. These astrocytes express GFAP and S100β and readily propagate calcium waves upon mechanical stimulation. Using pH-sensitive dye BCECF [2′,7′-bis-(carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein] and qPCR technique, we have confirmed that these astrocytes express functional NBC including electrogenic NBC (NBCe). In addition, astrocytes exposed to an ischemic solution (IS) that mimics the ischemic penumbral environment enhanced both mRNA and protein expression level of NBCe1 in astrocytes. Using IS and a generic NBC blocker S0859, we have studied the involvement of NBC in IS-induced human astrocytes death. Our results show that a 30 μM S0859 induced a 97.5 ± 1.6% (n = 10) cell death in IS-treated astrocytes, which is significantly higher than 43.6 ± 4.5%, (n = 10) in the control group treated with IS alone. In summary, a NBC blocker exaggerates IS-induced cell death, suggesting that NBC activity is essential for astrocyte survival when exposed to ischemic penumbral environment.

AB  - Abstract
Transcriptomic and proteomic approaches have separately proven effective at identifying novel mechanisms affecting addiction-related behavior; however, it is difficult to prioritize the many promising leads from each approach. A convergent secondary analysis of proteomic and transcriptomic results can glean additional information to help prioritize promising leads. The current study is a secondary analysis of the convergence of recently published separate transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of nucleus accumbens (NAc) tissue from rats subjected to environmental enrichment vs. isolation and cocaine self-administration vs. saline. Multiple bioinformatics approaches (e.g. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)) were used to interrogate these rich data sets. Although there was little correspondence between mRNA vs. protein at the individual target level, good correspondence was found at the level of gene/protein sets, particularly for the environmental enrichment manipulation. These data identify gene sets where there is a positive relationship between changes in mRNA and protein (e.g. glycolysis, ATP synthesis, translation elongation factor activity, etc.) and gene sets where there is an inverse relationship (e.g. ribosomes, Rho GTPase signaling, protein ubiquitination, etc.). Overall environmental enrichment produced better correspondence than cocaine self-administration. The individual targets contributing to mRNA and protein effects were largely not overlapping. As a whole, these results confirm that robust transcriptomic and proteomic data sets can provide similar results at the gene/protein set level even when there is little correspondence at the individual target level and little overlap in the targets contributing to the effects.

AB  - Abstract
Vitamin B12 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) are known to influence cognition. This study aims to examine if these nutrients affect the protein levels and gene expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the cortex and hippocampus in the second-generation offspring at 3 mo of age. Wistar rats were fed the following diets for two generations: Control (CON), vitamin B12 deficient (VBD), vitamin B12 deficient supplemented with n-3 PUFA (VBDO), vitamin B12 supplemented (VBS), vitamin B12 supplemented with n-3 PUFA (VBSO). The VEGF and NGF gene expression and protein levels in the hippocampus were lower (P ⩽ 0.01) in the VBD group as compared to the CON group while the VBDO group restored the VEGF and NGF gene expression (P ⩽ 0.01). The VBS group showed similar levels of NGF and VEGF to that of the CON group. However, the VBSO group demonstrated higher (P ⩽ 0.05) NGF gene expression and protein levels in the hippocampus and higher cortex NGF protein levels as compared to the CON group. In addition, VEGF (in hippocampus) and NGF (in cortex and hippocampus) protein levels were also higher (P ⩽ 0.05) in the VBSO group as compared to the VBS group. Our results indicate that the combined supplementation of vitamin B12 and n-3 PUFA improves NGF and maintains VEGF levels in the brain which may improve neurovascular function.

Background: The literature on the effects of nocebo on pain is sparse. The present experimental study investigated whether suggestions of nocebo hyperalgesia modified the startle response and whether increased startle contributed to the nocebo hyperalgesic effect. Methods: A design with four groups was employed; the participants were randomized into either a placebo group, a natural history group, or into two nocebo groups. The participants in the placebo and nocebo groups received suggestions of pain decrease or pain increase, together with a placebo or nocebo cream applied to the lower arm, respectively. Heat pain was induced by a PC-controlled thermode before and after the treatment. White noise was used to elicit startle responses. Startle was assessed by measuring eye blink electromyographic responses recorded from the right orbicularis oculi muscle. Results: The results showed that nocebo suggestions increased reports of pain and startle responses. Increased startle was significantly associated with the nocebo hyperalgesic response. Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that verbally induced expectations of increased pain engage cortical physiological defensive systems that in turn mediate the experience of increased pain.

AB  - Abstract
Propofol is a major intravenous anesthetic that facilitates GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory synaptic currents and modulates inward current (Ih), K+, and voltage-gated Na+ currents. This propofol-induced modulation of ionic currents changes intrinsic membrane properties and repetitive spike firing in cortical pyramidal neurons. However, it has been unknown whether propofol modulates these electrophysiological properties in GABAergic neurons, which express these ion channels at different levels. This study examined whether pyramidal and GABAergic neuronal properties are differentially modulated by propofol in the rat insular cortical slice preparation. We conducted multiple whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from pyramidal neurons and from GABAergic neurons, which were classified into fast-spiking (FS), low threshold spike (LTS), late-spiking (LS), and regular-spiking nonpyramidal (RSNP) neurons. We found that 100 μM propofol hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential and decreased input resistance in all types of neurons tested. Propofol also potently suppressed, and in most cases eliminated, repetitive spike firing in all these neurons. However, the potency of the propofol-induced changes in membrane and firing properties is particularly prominent in pyramidal neurons. Using a low concentration of propofol clarified this tendency: 30 μM propofol decreased the firing of pyramidal neurons but had little effect on GABAergic neurons. Pre-application of a GABAA receptor antagonist, picrotoxin (100 μM), diminished the propofol-induced suppression of neural activities in both pyramidal and FS neurons. These results suggest that GABAergic neurons, especially FS neurons, are less affected by propofol than are pyramidal neurons and that propofol-induced modulation of the intrinsic membrane properties and repetitive spike firing are principally mediated by GABAA receptor-mediated tonic currents

AB  - Abstract
The brain is a dynamic, flexible network that continuously reconfigures. However, the neural underpinnings of how state-dependent variability of dynamic functional connectivity (vdFC) relates to cognitive flexibility are unclear. We therefore investigated flexible functional connectivity during resting-state and task-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI and t-fMRI, resp.) and performed separate, out-of-scanner neuropsychological testing. We hypothesize that state-dependent vdFC between the frontoparietal network (FPN) and the default mode network (DMN) relates to cognitive flexibility. Seventeen healthy subjects performed the Stroop color word test and underwent t-fMRI (Stroop computerized version) and rs-fMRI. Time series were extracted from a cortical atlas, and a sliding window approach was used to obtain a number of correlation matrices per subject. vdFC was defined as the standard deviation of connectivity strengths over these windows. Higher task-state FPN–DMN vdFC was associated with greater out-of-scanner cognitive flexibility, while the opposite relationship was present for resting-state FPN–DMN vdFC. Moreover, greater contrast between task-state and resting-state vdFC related to better cognitive performance. In conclusion, our results suggest that not only the dynamics of connectivity between these networks is seminal for optimal functioning, but also that the contrast between dynamics across states reflects cognitive performance.

AB  - Abstract
Orexin neurons are known to augment the sympathetic control of cardiovascular function, however the role of orexin neurons in parasympathetic cardiac regulation remains unclear. To test the hypothesis that orexin neurons contribute to parasympathetic control we selectively expressed channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in orexin neurons in orexin-Cre transgenic rats and examined postsynaptic currents in cardiac vagal neurons (CVNs) in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV). Simultaneous photostimulation and recording in ChR2-expressing orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus resulted in reliable action potential firing as well as large whole-cell currents suggesting a strong expression of ChR2 and reliable optogenetic excitation. Photostimulation of ChR2-expressing fibers in the DMV elicited short-latency (ranging from 3.2 ms to 8.5 ms) postsynaptic currents in 16 out of 44 CVNs tested. These responses were heterogeneous and included excitatory glutamatergic (63%) and inhibitory GABAergic (37%) postsynaptic currents. The results from this study suggest different sub-population of orexin neurons may exert diverse influences on brainstem CVNs and therefore may play distinct functional roles in parasympathetic control of the heart.

AB  - Abstract
Coordinated activity in different sets of widely-projecting neurochemical systems characterize waking (W) and sleep (S). How and when this coordination is achieved during development is not known. We used embryos and newborns of a precocial bird species (chickens) to assess developmental activation in different neurochemical systems using cFos expression, which has been extensively employed to examine cellular activation during S and W in adult mammals. Similarly to adult mammals, newborn awake chicks showed significantly higher cFos expression in W-active hypocretin/orexin (H/O), serotonergic Dorsal Raphe, noradrenergic Locus Coeruleus and cholinergic Laterodorsal and Pedunculopontine Tegmental (Ch-LDT/PT) neurons when compared to sleeping chicks. cFos expression was significantly correlated both between these systems, and with the amount of W. S-active melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons showed very low cFos expression with no difference between sleeping and awake chicks, possibly due to the very short duration of S episodes. In embryonic chicks, cFos expression was low or absent across all five systems at embryonic day (E) 12. Unexpectedly, a strong activation was seen at E16 in H/O neurons. The highest activation of Ch-LDT/PT (also S-active) and MCH neurons was seen at E20. These data suggest that maturation of arousal systems is achieved soon after hatching, while S-control networks are active in late chick embryos.

The present study investigated the effects of (−)-sesamin on motor and memory deficits in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned mouse model of Parkinson’s disease (PD) with l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA). MPTP-lesioned (30 mg/kg/day, 5 days) mice showed deficits in memory including habit learning memory and spatial memory, which were further aggravated by daily treatment with 25 mg/kg l-DOPA for 21 days. However, daily treatment with (−)-sesamin (25 and 50 mg/kg) for 21 days ameliorated memory deficits in an MPTP-lesioned mouse model of PD treated with l-DOPA (25 mg/kg). Both (−)-sesamin doses reduced decreases in the retention latency time in the passive avoidance test, latency to fall of rotarod test and distance traveled in the open field test, and attenuated decreases in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunopositive cells, dopamine, and its metabolites in the substantia nigra-striatum. (−)-Sesamin reduced increases in the retention transfer latency time in the elevated plus-maze test and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) expression and reduced decreases in the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and cyclic AMP-response element binding protein (CREB) in the hippocampus. In contrast, daily treatment with 10 mg/kg l-DOPA for 21 days ameliorated memory deficits in MPTP-lesioned mice, and this effect was further improved by treatment with (−)-sesamin (25 and 50 mg/kg). These results suggest that (−)-sesamin protects against habit learning memory deficits by activating the dopamine neuronal system, while spatial memory deficits are decreased by its modulatory effects on the NMDAR-ERK1/2-CREB system. Accordingly, (−)-sesamin may act as an adjuvant phytonutrient for motor and memory deficits in patients with PD receiving l-DOPA.

The fingertip somatotopy in BA1 and BA3b of monkeys exhibits characteristic differences with a more discrete separation of the body parts in BA3b and a continuous orientation column-like structure in BA1. We present evidence for similar differences in the human somatotopy using BOLD fMRI for the investigations. Though the variability between the individual maps was large, we found a group-wide somatotopic representation in BA3b and BA1. The variability due to anatomical differences was small in our sample. This was demonstrated by comparing exact shortest distances in the individual brains and after nonlinear normalization to the group space template, for the removal of the individual anatomical variability. Distance mapping along Dijkstra paths was found to be a valid approximation to exact shortest paths only in the individual brains. The degree of fine-scale detail mapping was improved if valid surface distances instead of 3D Euclidean distances were applied. A further improvement was achieved by mapping the distances between all neighboring fingertips instead of only the outer fingertips. Taking into account all optimizations we found mirror symmetry of the somatotopy with respect to the interhemispheric gap.

AB  - Abstract
Epidemiological studies report that infarct size is decreased and stroke outcomes are improved in young females when compared to males. However, mechanistic insight is lacking. We posit that sex-specific differences in glial cell functions occurring immediately after ischemic stroke are a source of dichotomous outcomes. In this study we assessed astrocyte Ca2+ dynamics, aquaporin 4 (AQP4) polarity, S100β expression pattern, as well as, microglia morphology and phagocytic marker CD11b in male and female mice following 60 min of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion. We reveal sex differences in the frequency of intracellular astrocyte Ca2+ elevations (F(1,86) = 8.19, P = 0.005) and microglia volume (F(1,40) = 12.47, P = 0.009) immediately following MCA occlusion in acute brain slices. Measured in fixed tissue, AQP4 polarity was disrupted (F(5,86) = 3.30, P = 0.009) and the area of non-S100β immunoreactivity increased in ipsilateral brain regions after 60 min of MCA occlusion (F(5,86) = 4.72, P = 0.007). However, astrocyte changes were robust in male mice when compared to females. Additional sex differences were discovered regarding microglia phagocytic receptor CD11b. In sham mice, constitutively high CD11b immunofluorescence was observed in females when compared to males (P = 0.03). When compared to sham, only male mice exhibited an increase in CD11b immunoreactivity after MCA occlusion (P = 0.006). We posit that a sex difference in the presence of constitutive CD11b has a role in determining male and female microglia phagocytic responses to ischemia. Taken together, these findings are critical to understanding potential sex differences in glial physiology as well as stroke pathobiology which are foundational for the development of future sex-specific stroke therapies.

AB  - Abstract
Noradrenergic signaling, through the α2A and α2C adrenergic receptors modulates the cognitive and behavioral symptoms of disorders such as schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and addiction. However, it is unknown whether the α2B receptor has any significant role in CNS function. The present study elucidates the potential role of the α2B receptor in CNS function via the discovery and use of the first subtype-selective α2B antagonist (AGN-209419), and behavioral analyses of α-receptor knockout (KO) mice. Using AGN-209419 as radioligand, α2B receptor binding sites were identified within the olfactory bulb, cortex, thalamus, cerebellum, and striatum. Based on the observed expression patterns of α2 subtypes in the brain, we compared α2B KO, α2A KO and α2C KO mice behavioral phenotypes with their respective wild-type lines in anxiety (plus maze), compulsive (marble burying), and sensorimotor (prepulse inhibition) tasks. α2B KO mice exhibited increased marble burying and α2C KO mice exhibited an increased startle response to a pulse stimulus, but otherwise intact prepulse inhibition. To further explore compulsive behavior, we evaluated novelty-induced locomotor hyperactivity and found that α2B KO and α2C KO mice exhibited increased locomotion in the open field. Interestingly, when challenged with amphetamine, α2C KO mice increased activity at lower doses relative to either α2A KO or WT mice. However, α2B KO mice exhibited stereotypy at doses of amphetamine that were only locomotor stimulatory to all other genotypes. Following co-administration of AGN-209419 with low-dose amphetamine in WT mice, stereotypy was observed, mimicking the α2B KO phenotype. These findings suggest that the α2B receptor is involved in CNS behaviors associated with sensorimotor gating and compulsivity, and may be therapeutically relevant for disorders such as schizophrenia, ADHD, post-traumatic stress disorder, addiction, and obsessive compulsive disorder.

AB  - Abstract
Combinations of Ca2+ channel inhibitors have been proposed as an effective means to prevent excess Ca2+ flux and death of neurons and glia following neurotrauma in vivo. However, it is not yet known if beneficial outcomes such as improved viability have been due to direct effects on intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. Here, the effects of combinations of Lomerizine (Lom), 2,3-dioxo-7-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-quinoxalinyl]acetic acid monohydrate (YM872), 3,5-dimethyl-1-adamantanamine (memantine (Mem)) and/or adenosine 5′-triphosphate periodate oxidized sodium salt (oxATP) to block voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, Ca2+ permeable α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, NMDA receptors and purinergic P2X7 receptors (P2X7R) respectively, on Ca2+ concentration and viability of rat primary mixed cortical (MC) cultures exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) insult, were assessed. The contribution of ryanodine-sensitive intracellular stores to intracellular Ca2+ concentration was also assessed. Live cell calcium imaging revealed that a 30 min H2O2 insult induced a slow increase in intracellular Ca2+, in part from intracellular sources, associated with loss of cell viability by 6 h. Most combinations of inhibitors that included oxATP significantly decreased Ca2+ influx and increased cell viability when administered simultaneously with H2O2. However, reductions in intracellular Ca2+ concentration were not always linked to improved cell viability. Examination of the density of specific cell subpopulations demonstrated that most combinations of inhibitors that included oxATP preserved NG2+ non-oligodendroglial cells, but preservation of astrocytes and neurons required additional inhibitors. Olig2+ oligodendroglia and ED-1+ activated microglia/macrophages were not preserved by any of the inhibitor combinations. These data indicate that following H2O2 insult, limiting intracellular Ca2+ entry via P2X7R is generally associated with increased cell viability. Protection of NG2+ non-oligodendroglial cells by Ca2+ channel inhibitor combinations may contribute to observed beneficial outcomes in vivo.

AB  - Abstract
Compared to isometric activities, the neural basis of fatigue induced by repetitive tasks has been scarcely studied. Recently, we showed that during short-lasting repetitive tasks at the maximal possible rate (finger tapping for 10 and 30 s), tapping rate and maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force decrease at the end of finger tapping. We also observed larger silent periods (SP) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation during MVC post finger tapping. However, if SP were induced by cervicomedullary stimulation (CMS) they remained unchanged. This suggested a supraspinal origin of fatigue for repetitive tasks. Nevertheless, CMS SP only partially explore spinal excitability; therefore, to evaluate a spinal origin of fatigue it is essential to know the features of the CMS-evoked potentials (CMEP). Herein, we evaluated (n = 15) the amplitude of the CMEP during MVC executed immediately (no gap) after a short-lasting finger tapping task; we also evaluated the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) so that the amplitude of the CMEP was expressed as a function of the CMAP amplitude. Indices of fatigue obtained during finger tapping were compared with those obtained during short-lasting maximal isometric tasks. While indices of excitability increased initially in both tasks, they decreased with the isometric task only when the task was prolonged to 30 s. We suggest that the inability to maintain increased levels of spinal excitability during task execution is a neurophysiological mark of fatigue. Our results suggest that the origin of fatigue induced by brief and fast repetitive tasks is not spinal.

AB  - Abstract
The endocannabinoid system comprises receptors (CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors), enzymes (Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase [FAAH], which synthesizes the endocannabinoid anandamide), as well as the anandamide membrane transporter (AMT). Importantly, previous experiments have demonstrated that the endocannabinoid system modulates multiple neurobiological functions, including sleep. For instance, SR141716A (the CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist) as well as URB597 (the FAAH inhibitor) increase waking in rats whereas VDM-11 (the blocker of the AMT) enhances sleep in rodents. However, no further evidence is available regarding the neurobiological role of the endocannabinoid system in the homeostatic control of sleep. Therefore, the aim of the current experiment was to test if SR141716A, URB597 or VDM-11 would modulate the sleep rebound after sleep deprivation. Thus, these compounds were systemically injected (5, 10, 20 mg/kg; ip; separately each one) into rats after prolonged waking. We found that SR141716A and URB597 blocked in dose-dependent fashion the sleep rebound whereas animals treated with VDM-11 displayed sleep rebound during the recovery period. Complementary, injection after sleep deprivation of either SR141716A or URB597 enhanced dose-dependently the extracellular levels of dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (EP), serotonin (5-HT), as well as adenosine (AD) while VDM-11 caused a decline in contents of these molecules. These findings suggest that SR141716A or URB597 behave as a potent stimulants since they suppressed the sleep recovery period after prolonged waking. It can be concluded that elements of the endocannabinoid system, such as the CB1 cannabinoid receptor, FAAH and AMT, modulate the sleep homeostasis after prolonged waking.

AB  - Abstract
Human growth hormone (GH) displays promising protective effects in the central nervous system after damage caused by various insults. Current evidence suggests that these effects may involve N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function, a receptor that also is believed to play a role in opioid-induced neurotoxicity. The aims of the present study were to examine the acute toxic effects of methadone, an opioid receptor agonist and NMDA receptor antagonist, as well as to evaluate the protective properties of recombinant human GH (rhGH) on methadone-induced toxicity. Primary cortical cell cultures from embryonic day 17 rats were grown for 7 days in vitro. Cells were treated with methadone for 24 h and the 50% lethal dose was calculated and later used for protection studies with rhGH. Cellular toxicity was determined by measuring mitochondrial activity, lactate dehydrogenase release, and caspase activation. Furthermore, the mRNA expression levels of NMDA receptor subunits were investigated following methadone and rhGH treatment using quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis. A significant protective effect was observed with rhGH treatment on methadone-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and in methadone-induced LDH release. Furthermore, methadone significantly increased caspase-3 and -7 activation but rhGH was unable to inhibit this effect. The mRNA expression of the NMDA receptor subunit GluN1, GluN2a, and GluN2b increased following methadone treatment, as assessed by qPCR, and rhGH treatment effectively normalized this expression to control levels. We have demonstrated that rhGH can rescue cells from methadone-induced toxicity by maintaining mitochondrial function, cellular integrity, and NMDA receptor complex expression.

The present study explored the relationship between motor-preparatory electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, motivation, and motor performance (specifically premotor reaction time [RT]). Participants performed a RT task by squeezing a hand dynamometer in response to an auditory “go” signal. We recorded EEG and electromyography to index beta-suppression and premotor RT, respectively. Participants’ motivation on each trial was modulated by offering monetary incentives at different magnitudes. Mixed-effect linear regression models showed that monetary incentive predicted premotor RT when controlling for beta-suppression, and beta-suppression independently predicted premotor RT. Thus, it appears motivation and beta-suppression can facilitate motor performance independent of one another. A plausible explanation of this effect is that motivation can affect motor performance independent of the motor cortex by influencing subcortical motor circuitry.

AB  - Abstract
Uric acid is a naturally occurring, endogenous compound that impacts mental health. In particular, uric acid levels are associated with emotion-related psychopathology (e.g., anxiety and depression). Therefore, understanding uric acid’s impact on the brain would provide valuable new knowledge regarding neural mechanisms that mediate the relationship between uric acid and mental health. Brain regions including the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus underlie stress reactivity and emotion regulation. Thus, uric acid may impact emotion by modifying the function of these brain regions. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a psychosocial stress task to investigate the relationship between baseline uric acid levels (in saliva) and brain function. Results demonstrate that activity within the bilateral hippocampal complex varied with uric acid concentrations. Specifically, activity within the hippocampus and surrounding cortex increased as a function of uric acid level. The current findings suggest that uric acid levels modulate stress-related hippocampal activity. Given that the hippocampus has been implicated in emotion regulation during psychosocial stress, the present findings offer a potential mechanism by which uric acid impacts mental health.

AB  - Abstract
Orofacial pain conditions including temporomandibular disorder (TMD) and migraine are characterized by peripheral and central sensitization of trigeminal nociceptive neurons. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in promoting bidirectional signaling within the trigeminal system to mediate sensitization of primary nociceptive neurons. Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were injected intercisternally with CGRP or co-injected with the receptor antagonist CGRP8–37 or KT 5720, a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor. Nocifensive head withdrawal response to mechanical stimulation was investigated using von Frey filaments. Expression of PKA, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) in the spinal cord and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (P-ERK) in the ganglion was studied using immunohistochemistry. Some animals were co-injected with CGRP and Fast Blue dye and the ganglion was imaged using fluorescent microscopy. CGRP increased nocifensive responses to mechanical stimulation when compared to control. Co-injection of CGRP8–37 or KT 5720 with CGRP inhibited the nocifensive response. CGRP stimulated PKA and GFAP expression in the spinal cord, and P-ERK in ganglion neurons. Seven days post injection, Fast Blue was observed in ganglion neurons and satellite glial cells. Our results demonstrate that elevated levels of CGRP in the upper spinal cord promote sensitization of primary nociceptive neurons via a mechanism that involves activation of PKA centrally and P-ERK in ganglion neurons. Our findings provide evidence of bidirectional signaling within the trigeminal system that facilitate increased neuron-glia communication within the ganglion associated with trigeminal sensitization.

AB  - Abstract
Our previous studies have suggested a strong involvement of serotonergic innervations in epileptogenesis and associated memory impairment. Several studies have suggested that the modulation of 5-HT3 receptors could serve as a promising tool for the management of epilepsy and memory deficit. The present study was envisaged to confirm this hypothesis. In this study, kindling was induced in male Swiss Albino mice using a subconvulsive dose of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (35 mg/kg at 48 ± 2 h). Once the animals were kindled, they were treated with a vehicle, ondansetron (0.1, 0.5, 1 mg/kg/day; i.p.), m-chlorophenylbiguanide (m-CPBG) (1 mg/kg/day; i.p.), and ondansetron + m-CPBG for 20 days. On days 5, 10, 15, and 20, they were administered a PTZ challenging dose (35 mg/kg) to assess the seizure severity score; thereafter, memory was evaluated. After behavioral assessment on day 20, the animals were sacrificed and their brains were isolated to estimate cortical and hippocampal neurotransmitter levels (glutamate and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) by the high-performance liquid chromatography with the fluorescence detection method, and the nitrite level and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity by the microplate reader method). Ondansetron treatment significantly reduced the seizure severity and improved the acquisition performance in a dose-dependent manner. Neurochemical analysis suggested that ondansetron treatment significantly reduced the nitrite level and AChE activity in the cortex as well as in the hippocampus. The outcome of this study suggests the reduction in AChE activity and the nitrite level could be considered as protective mechanisms of ondansetron for amelioration of PTZ kindling and associated memory deficit.

Background: The unilaterally-lesioned 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat is one of the most commonly used experimental models of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here we investigated whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that is widely used in human PD research, has the potential to non-invasively detect macroscopic structural brain changes in the 6-OHDA rat in ways translatable to humans. Methods: We measured the gray matter (GM) composition in the unilateral 6-OHDA rat in comparison to sham animals using whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) – an unbiased MR image analysis technique. The number of nigral dopamine (DA) neurons and the density of their cortical projections were examined post-mortem using immunohistochemistry. Results: VBM revealed widespread bilateral changes in gray matter volume (GMV) on a topographic scale in the brains of 6-OHDA rats, compared to sham-operated rats. The greatest changes were in the lesioned hemisphere, which displayed reductions of GMV in motor, cingulate and somatosensory cortex. Histopathological results revealed dopaminergic cell loss in the substantia nigra (SN) and a denervation in the striatum, as well as in the frontal, somatosensory and cingulate cortices. Conclusion: Unilateral nigrostriatal 6-OHDA lesioning leads to widespread GMV changes, which extend beyond the nigrostriatal system and resemble advanced Parkinsonism. This study highlights the potential of structural MRI, and VBM in particular, for the system-level phenotyping of rodent models of Parkinsonism and provides a methodological framework for future studies in novel rodent models as they become available to the research community.

The dorsal diencephalic conduction system (DDC) is an important pathway of the brain reward circuitry, linking together forebrain and midbrain structures. The present work was aimed at describing the effect of a DDC lesion on the distribution of Fos-like immunoreactivity (FLIR) following intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) of the lateral hypothalamus (LH). Rats were implanted with monopolar electrodes and divided into three groups; the first two groups were trained to self-stimulate at the LH, whereas the third group received no stimulation and served as a control. Among the two groups that were trained for ICSS, one of them received a lesion at the DDC and was tested for ICSS on the subsequent 5 days. On the last day of testing, control rats were placed in operant chambers without receiving any stimulation, and the remaining rats were allowed to receive the stimulation for 1 h. All rats were then processed for FLIR. As previously shown, a lesion at the DDC resulted in significant attenuations of the rewarding effectiveness of LH stimulation. Results also show a higher FLIR in several reward-related areas following LH stimulation, especially in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the stimulation electrode. Compared to non-lesioned rats, lesioned animals had lower FLIR in certain brain regions, suggesting that those regions that were activated by the rewarding stimulation may be functionally interconnected with the DDC.

AB  - Abstract
Our series of rat experiments have shown that locomotor activity, arousal level, body and brown adipose tissue temperatures, heart rate and arterial pressure increase episodically in an integrated manner approximately every 100 min (ultradian manner). Although it has been proposed that the integrated ultradian pattern is a fundamental biological rhythm across species, there are no reports of the integrated ultradian pattern in species other than rats. The aim of the present study was to establish a mouse model using simultaneous recording of locomotor activity, eating behavior, body temperature, heart rate and arousal in order to determine whether their behavior and physiology are organized in an ultradian manner in normal (wild-type) mice. We also incorporated the same recording in prepro-orexin knockout (ORX-KO) mice to reveal the role of orexin in the brain mechanisms underlying ultradian patterning. The orexin system is one of the key conductors required for coordinating autonomic functions and behaviors, and thus may contribute to ultradian patterning. In wild-type mice, locomotor activity, arousal level, body temperature and heart rate increased episodically every 93 ± 18 min (n = 8) during 24 h. Eating was integrated into the ultradian pattern, commencing 23 ± 4 min (n = 8) after the onset of an electroencephalogram (EEG) ultradian episode. The integrated ultradian pattern in wild-type mice is very similar to that observed in rats. In ORX-KO mice, the ultradian episodic changes in locomotor activity, EEG arousal indices and body temperature were significantly attenuated, but the ultradian patterning was preserved. Our findings support the view that the ultradian pattern is common across species. The present results also suggest that orexin contributes to driving ultradian episodic changes, however, this neuropeptide is not essential for the generation of the ultradian pattern.

AB  - Abstract
The superior paraolivary nucleus (SPON) is a prominent structure in the mammalian auditory brainstem with a proposed role in encoding transient broadband sounds such as vocalized utterances. Currently, the source of excitatory pathways that project to the SPON and how these inputs contribute to SPON function are poorly understood. To shed light on the nature of these inputs, we measured evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in the SPON originating from the intermediate acoustic stria and compared them with the properties of EPSCs in the lateral superior olive (LSO) originating from the ventral acoustic stria during auditory development from postnatal day 5 to 22 in mice. Before hearing onset, EPSCs in the SPON and LSO are very similar in size and kinetics. After the onset of hearing, SPON excitation is refined to extremely few (2:1) fibers, with each strengthened by an increase in release probability, yielding fast and strong EPSCs. LSO excitation is recruited from more fibers (5:1), resulting in strong EPSCs with a comparatively broader stimulus–response range after hearing onset. Evoked SPON excitation is comparatively weaker than evoked LSO excitation, likely due to a larger fraction of postsynaptic GluR2-containing Ca2+-impermeable AMPA receptors after hearing onset. Taken together, SPON excitation develops synaptic properties that are suited for transmitting single events with high temporal reliability and the strong, dynamic LSO excitation is compatible with high rate-level sensitivity. Thus, the excitatory input pathways to the SPON and LSO mature to support different decoding strategies of respective coarse temporal and sound intensity information at the brainstem level.

AB  - Abstract
Dysfunction of N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) is believed to underlie some of the symptoms in schizophrenia, and non-competitive NMDAR antagonists (including phencyclidine (PCP)) are widely used as pharmacological schizophrenia models. Furthermore, mounting evidence suggests that impaired γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission contributes to the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Thus alterations in GABAergic interneurons have been observed in schizophrenia patients and animal models. Acute systemic administration of PCP increases levels of c-Fos in several cortical and subcortical areas, but whether such induction occurs in specific populations of GABAergic interneuron subtypes still remains to be established.

We performed an immunohistochemical analysis of the PCP-induced c-Fos-immunoreactivity (IR) in parvalbumin (PV) and calbindin (CB) interneuron subtypes in the cortex and thalamus of rats. A single dose of PCP (10 mg/kg, s.c.) significantly increased total number of c-Fos-IR in: (1) the prelimbic, infralimbic, anterior cingulate, ventrolateral orbital, motor, somatosensory and retrosplenial cortices as well as the nucleus accumbens (NAc), field CA1 of the hippocampus (CA1) field of hippocampus and mediodorsal thalamus (MD); (2) PV-IR cells in the ventrolateral orbitofrontal and retrosplenial cortices and CA1 field of hippocampus; and (3) CB-IR cells in the motor cortex.

Overall, our data indicate that PCP activates a wide range of cortical and subcortical brain regions and that a substantial part of this activation is present in GABAergic interneurons in certain regions. This suggests that the psychotomimetic effect of PCP may be mediated via GABAergic interneurons.

AB  - Abstract
Anticholinergic medications can exert their effects by acting on muscarinic receptors, which mediates the function of acetylcholine in the central nervous system. Acetylcholine plays a number of roles, particularly in regard to the control of muscle activity and normal cognitive functioning. Eighteen subjects were recruited into the human, double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-way crossover study. Pupil diameter and blink rate were assessed at rest while eye tracking technology recorded eye characteristics. Thereafter a cognitive task was performed, where pupil size and blink rate were once again measured. Assessments were performed pre-ingestion, 0.5 h and 2 h following the ingestion of a strong centrally acting anticholinergic (promethazine hydrochloride), a moderate centrally acting anticholinergic (hyoscine hydrobromide), an anticholinergic devoid of central effects (hyoscine butylbromide) and placebo. At rest, hyoscine hydrobromide was the only medication to increase pupil diameter and no drug intervention influenced blink rate. During performance of the cognitive task, hyoscine hydrobromide increased pupil diameter and promethazine increased blink rate. Promethazine was the only medication to influence the modified attention network test (ANT) by increasing the conflict effect and grand mean reaction time (RT). Pupil diameter and blink rate were both influenced by the central anticholinergics during performance of the cognitive test, thus highlighting the importance of central cholinergic pathways in the control of pupil diameter and blink rate. The collective effects of central anticholinergics on the modified ANT and on pupil diameter and blink rate during its performance, conveys the importance of central cholinergic pathways in cognitive function.

AB  - Abstract
In monkeys, motor intention in its different forms emerges from a parietal–frontal gradient of visual, eye and hand signals, containing discrete dominant domains. These are formed by areas sharing cortical connections and functional properties. Within this gradient, the combination of different inputs determines the tuning properties of neurons, while local and long cortico-cortical connections shape the structure and temporal delays of the network. The pathways linking similar functional domains in parietal and frontal cortex sculpt information processing systems related to different functions, all requiring eye-hand coordination. fMRI experiments show that similar gradients lay at the core of cognitive-motor control in humans as well. This eye-hand matrix provides a framework to address, within a unitary frame, not only basic forms of motor behavior, such as reaching and grasping, but also actions of increasing complexity, such as interception of moving targets, tool use, construction of complex objects, maze analysis and solution, among others. The organization of the cerebral cortex into functional gradients and domains, beyond frontal and parietal cortices, is common to other brain regions, such as prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, and does not support views of the parieto-frontal operations based on specific and strictly segregated eye and hand modules. These can only be found at the eye and hand motor output domains in the frontal cortex, that is in the frontal eye fields and in the primary motor cortex, respectively.

AB  - Abstract
Brain aging is marked by a decline in cognitive abilities and associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Recent studies have shown, neurogenesis continues into adulthood but is known to be decreasing during advancing age and these changes may contribute to cognitive alterations. Advances, which aim to promote better aging are of paramount importance. Dietary restriction (DR) is the only non-genetic intervention that reliably extends life- and health-span. Mechanisms of how and why DR and age affect neurogenesis are not well-understood, and have not been utilized much in the zebrafish, which has become a popular model to study brain aging and neurodegenerative disease due to widely available genetic tools. In this study we used young (8–8.5 months) and old (26–32.5 months) zebrafish as the model to investigate the effects of a short-term DR on actively proliferating cells. We successfully applied a 10-week DR to young and old fish, which resulted in a significant loss of body weight in both groups with no effect on normal age-related changes in body growth. We found that age decreased cell proliferation and increased senescence associated β-galactosidase, as well as shortened telomere lengths. In contrast, DR shortened telomere lengths only in young animals. Neither age nor DR changed the differentiation patterns of glial cells. Our results suggest that the potential effects of DR could be mediated by telomere regulation and whether these are beneficial or negative remains to be determined.

AB  - Abstract
Recent discussions on the ethics in animal experimentation instigate the refinement of methods used in Behavioral Neuroscience, particularly regarding fear/anxiety paradigms. We propose the Light Switch-Off Test (LSOT), based on the innate motivation to cease an aversive stimulus (bright light), displayed naturally by rodents in their habitat. Forty-six male adult Wistar rats were allocated into independent groups: control, diazepam at 1 or 2 mg/kg, and meta-Chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) at 0.5 or 1 mg/kg. The experimental box has two square compartments, separated by an acrylic portal. In each side of the box, there is a 40-W incandescent light bulb. After a habituation period in the box, 40 light stimuli (trials lasting up to 20 s each) are emitted at random intervals. By crossing compartments during the lighted period, the rat could switch-off the stimulus. Parameters observed are the number of switch-off responses (SORs), latency of SOR and intertrial locomotion. The SOR frequency was higher in rats treated with mCPP at 1 mg/kg, an anxiogenic drug, while diazepam at the doses used in this study did not produce effects. Animals exposed solely to the box for the length of the test did not respond in a false positive way. Therefore, the SOR represents a good index to measure the innate rodent fear of bright-lighten areas, once they react quickly in order to turn off the stimulus. Among its many advantages, the LSOT is a simple, replicable, non-invasive and minimally stressful procedure, since it does not expose animals to excessively aversive stimulus.

AB  - Abstract
Zellweger syndrome (ZS) is a peroxisome biogenesis disorder that involves significant neuropathology, the molecular basis of which is still poorly understood. Using a mouse model of ZS with brain-restricted deficiency of the peroxisome biogenesis protein PEX13, we demonstrated an expanded and morphologically modified brain mitochondrial population. Cultured fibroblasts from PEX13-deficient mouse embryo displayed similar changes, as well as increased levels of mitochondrial superoxide and membrane depolarization; this phenotype was rescued by antioxidant treatment. Significant oxidative damage to neurons in brain was indicated by products of lipid and DNA oxidation. Similar overall changes were observed for glial cells. In toto, these findings suggest that mitochondrial oxidative stress and aberrant mitochondrial dynamics are associated with the neuropathology arising from PEX13 deficiency.

AB  - Abstract
An acute brain insult can cause a spectrum of primary and secondary pathologies including increased risk for epilepsy, mortality and neurodegeneration. The endocannabinoid system, involved in protecting the brain against network hyperexcitability and excitotoxicity, is profoundly dysregulated by acute brain insults. We hypothesize that post-insult dysregulation of the endocannabinoid signaling may contribute to deleterious effects of an acute brain injury and potentiation of endocannabinoid transmission soon after an insult may reduce its pathological outcomes. Effects of an acute post-insult administration of the endocannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 on early seizure occurrence, animal mortality and hippocampal cell loss were studied in the lithium–pilocarpine status model. A single dose of WIN55,212-2 (5 mg/kg) administered four hours after the end of status epilepticus (SE) reduced the incidence of early seizures during the first two post-SE days though did not change their duration and latency. Brief 4–6-Hz spike–wave discharges appeared de novo in the latent post-SE period and the acute administration of WIN55,212-2 also reduced the incidence of the epileptiform events. A single dose of WIN55,212-2 administered soon after SE improved survival of animals and reduced cell loss in the dentate hilus but did not prevent appearance of spontaneous recurrent seizures in the chronic period. Thus, a brief pharmacological stimulation of the endocannabinoid system soon after a brain insult exerts beneficial effects on its pathological outcome though does not prevent epileptogenesis.

AB  - Abstract
This study examined the effect of neuron-endothelial coupling on the survival of neurons after ischemia and the possible mechanism underlying that effect. Whole-cell patch-clamp experiments were performed on cortical neurons cultured alone or directly cocultured with brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC). Propidium iodide (PI) and NeuN staining were performed to examine neuronal death following oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). We found that the neuronal transient outward potassium currents (IA) decreased in the coculture system, whereas the outward delayed-rectifier potassium currents (IK) did not. Sodium nitroprusside, a NO donor, enhanced BMEC-induced IA inhibition and nitro-l-arginine methylester, a NOS inhibitor, partially prevented this inhibition. Moreover, the neurons directly cocultured with BMEC showed more resistance to OGD-induced injury compared with the neurons cultured alone, and that neuroprotective effect was abolished by treatment with NS5806, an activator of the IA. These results indicate that vascular endothelial cells assist neurons to prevent hypoxic injury via inhibiting neuronal IA by production of NO in the direct neuron-BMEC coculture system. These results further provide direct evidence of functional coupling between neurons and vascular endothelial cells. This study clearly demonstrates that vascular endothelial cells play beneficial roles in the pathophysiological processes of neurons after hypoxic injury, suggesting that the improvement of neurovascular coupling or functional remodeling may become an important therapeutic target for preventing brain injury.

AB  - Abstract
Protective postural responses, including stepping, to recover equilibrium are critical for fall prevention and are impaired in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD) with freezing of gait (FoG). Improving protective postural responses through training may reduce falls in this population. However, motor learning, the basis of neurorehabilitation, is also impaired in people with PD and, in particular, people with PD who experience freezing. It is unknown whether people with PD who freeze can improve protective postural responses, and whether these improvements are similar to nonfreezers. Our goal was to assess whether people with freezing can improve protective postural responses and retain these improvements similarly to nonfreezers. Twenty-eight people with PD (13 freezers, 15 nonfreezers) were enrolled. Improvement in protective postural responses was assessed over the course of 25 forward and 25 backward support surface translations (delivered in pseudo-random order). Postural responses were re-assessed 24 h later to determine whether improvements were retained. People who freeze did not improve or retain improvement in protective postural responses as well as nonfreezers in our primary outcome variable, center of mass (COM) displacement after perturbations (post hoc across group assessments: freezers- p = 0.14 and nonfreezers- p = 0.001, respectively). However, other protective stepping outcomes, including margin of stability, step length, and step time, improved similarly across groups. Significant improvements were retained in both groups. In conclusion, people with PD who freeze exhibited reduced ability to improve protective postural responses in some, but not all, outcome variables. Additional training may be necessary to improve protective postural responses in people with PD who freeze.

AB  - Abstract
Objectives: Intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) is one of the most common causes of stroke worldwide and, in particular, has been implicated as a leading cause of recurrent ischemic stroke. We adapted a rat model of atherosclerosis to study brain intracranial atherosclerosis, and further investigated the effect of omega-3 fatty acids (O3FA) in attenuating development of ICAS. Materials and methods: Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into control normal-cholesterol or high-cholesterol diet groups with or without O3FA for up to 6 weeks. During the first 2 weeks, NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME, 3 mg/mL) was added to the drinking water of the high-cholesterol groups. The rats received supplementation with O3FA (5 mg/kg/day) by gavages. Blood lipids including low density lipoprotein (LDL), cholesterol (CHO), triglycerides (TG) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) were measured at 3 and 6 weeks. The lumen of middle cerebral artery (MCA) and the thickness of the vessel wall were assessed. Inflammatory molecular markers were assessed by Western blot. Results: A high-cholesterol diet exhibited a significant increase in the classic blood markers (LDL, CHO, and TG) for atherosclerosis, as well as a decrease in HDL. These markers were found to be progressively more severe with time. Lumen stenosis and intimal thickening were increased in MCA. O3FA showed attenuation of blood lipids with an absence of morphological changes. O3FA significantly reduced the inflammatory marker CD68 in MCA and prevented monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) expression in the brain. O3FA similarly decreased inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6), markers affiliated with monocyte activity in atherosclerosis. Furthermore, O3FA significantly inhibited the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), a marker for endothelial activation. Lastly, O3FA increased ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) protein expression via silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) activation, thus increasing cholesterol efflux from macrophages to HDL. Conclusions: Long-term O3FA dietary supplementation prevents the development of intracranial atherosclerosis. This O3FA effect appears to be mediated by its prevention of macrophage infiltration into the vessel wall, therefore reducing inflammation and intimal thickening. While similar effects in humans need to be determined, O3FA dietary supplement shows promising results in the prevention of ICAS.

AB  - Abstract
Although there is little overlap in core diagnostic criteria for ADHD and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), ASD symptoms are estimated to co-occur in children with ADHD in 20–50% of cases. As motor control deficits are common to both disorders, we investigated the impact of ASD symptoms on ocular motor control in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder-Combined Type (ADHD-CT), using a cued saccade paradigm sensitive to cerebellar ocular motor impairment in ASD. Basic saccade metrics (latency, velocity and accuracy), trial-to-trial variability, and main sequences relationships (saccade velocity for a given amplitude) were assessed, for 14 males with ADHD-CT and 14 typically developing (TD) males (aged 8–14, IQ &gt; 80). Our results revealed that saccade profiles of the ADHD-CT group showed a pattern of hypermetria and altered main sequence. As the cerebellum is crucially involved in the regulation of saccade parameters, we propose that this pattern of deficit in ADHD-CT is consistent with the widely reported morphological abnormalities in ocular motor vermis (cerebellar lobules VI-VII) in ADHD-CT and ASD.

AB  - Abstract
Brain neurons of the deep-diving hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) are known to be inherently hypoxia tolerant. Here, we have used in vitro field potential recordings in hippocampal slices to compare effects of severe hypoxia on synaptic transmission in hooded seals vs. non-diving mammals. Synaptic responses of mice (Mus musculus) to hypoxia were in accordance with previously published data. Hippocampal slices of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), an alternative large-mammal non-diving model, behaved in a similar way as mouse slices, in that synaptic activity disappeared rapidly without recovery after &gt;20 min in hypoxia. The synaptic activity of hooded seal slices decreased in hypoxia, but unlike mice and reindeer, it remained at &gt;30% of the normoxic amplitude throughout 3 h of severe hypoxia. Also, upon reoxygenation, the signal recovered to ∼50% of the pre-challenge (normoxic) amplitude. The AMPA-type glutamate receptor antagonist CNQX eliminated this signal, showing that it was not an artifact. Paired pulse facilitation (PPF), typically associated with increased presynaptic calcium (Ca2+) levels, was significantly reduced in the seal slices. We propose that the build-up of Ca2+ concentration is limited in seal presynaptic terminals, possibly due to a high Ca2+ buffering capacity, which could explain both the attenuated PPF and the remarkable neural hypoxia tolerance of this species. Although we found no significant hypoxia-induced upregulation of mRNA for the Ca2+ binding proteins calbindin d28k or parvalbumin in hooded seal hippocampal slices, a recent study reports very high transcript levels of the Ca2+ binding protein S100B in this species, which is in support of the hypothesis.

AB  - Abstract
Using an immunohistochemical technique, we mapped the immunoreactive structures containing methionine-enkephalin-Arg6-Gly7-Leu8 (Met-8) (a marker for the pro-enkephalin system) in the human diencephalon. Compared with previous studies, we observed a more widespread distribution of Met-8 in the human diencephalon. Met-8-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers exhibited a more widespread distribution in the hypothalamus than in the thalamus. We observed six populations of Met-8-immunoreactive cell bodies. These perikarya were observed in the paratenial thalamic nucleus, ventromedial and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei, lateral hypothalamic area, pallidohypothalamic nucleus and in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (posterior part). In the thalamus, Met-8-immunoreactive fibers were primarily observed in the midline region, whereas in the hypothalamus, these fibers were widely distributed. In general, a moderate/low density of Met-8-immunoreactive fibers was observed in the diencephalic nuclei. A moderate density was observed in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus, reuniens thalamic nucleus, lateral and medial geniculate nuclei, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (posterior part) and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. The present study is the first to demonstrate the presence of clusters of Met-8-immunoreactive cell bodies in the human thalamus and hypothalamus, the distribution of fibers containing neuropeptides in the hypothalamus and the presence of these fibers in several thalamic nuclei. This neuroanatomical study will serve to elucidate the physiological roles of Met-8 in future studies of the human diencephalon.

AB  - Abstract
Exogenous granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) has emerged as a drug candidate for improving the outcome after peripheral nerve injuries. We raised the question if exogenous G-CSF can improve nerve regeneration following a clinically relevant model – nerve transection and repair – in healthy and diabetic rats.

In short-term experiments, distance of axonal regeneration and extent of injury-induced Schwann cell death was quantified by staining for neurofilaments and cleaved caspase 3, respectively, seven days after repair. There was no difference in axonal outgrowth between G-CSF-treated and non-treated rats, regardless if healthy Wistar or diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats were examined. However, G-CSF treatment caused a significant 13% decrease of cleaved caspase 3-positive Schwann cells at the lesion site in healthy rats, but only a trend in diabetic rats. In the distal nerve segments of healthy rats a similar trend was observed.

In long-term experiments of healthy rats, regeneration outcome was evaluated at 90 days after repair by presence of neurofilaments, wet weight of gastrocnemius muscle, and perception of touch (von Frey monofilament testing weekly). The presence of neurofilaments distal to the suture line was similar in G-CSF-treated and non-treated rats. The weight ratio of ipsi-over contralateral gastrocnemius muscles, and perception of touch at any time point, were likewise not affected by G-CSF treatment.

In addition, the inflammatory response in short- and long-term experiments was studied by analyzing ED1 stainable macrophages in healthy rats, but in neither case was any attenuation seen at the injury site or distal to it.

G-CSF can prevent caspase 3 activation in Schwann cells in the short-term, but does not detectably affect the inflammatory response, nor improve early or late axonal outgrowth or functional recovery.

The recent development of organoid techniques, in which embryonic brain-like tissue can be grown from human or mouse stem cells in vitro offers the potential to transform the way in which brain development is studied. In this review, we summarize key aspects of the embryonic development of mammalian forebrains, focussing in particular on the cerebral cortex and highlight significant differences between mouse and primates, including human. We discuss recent work using cerebral organoids that has revealed key similarities and differences between their development and that of the brain in vivo. Finally, we outline the ways in which cerebral organoids can be used in combination with CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to unravel genetic mechanisms that control embryonic development of the cerebral cortex, how this can help us understand the causes of neurodevelopmental disorders and some of the key challenges which will have to be resolved before organoids can become a mainstream tool to study brain development.

AB  - Abstract
Trigeminal neuropathic pain is described as constant excruciating facial pain. The study goal was to investigate the role of nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) in a model of chronic orofacial neuropathic pain (CCI-ION). The study examines LC’s relationship to both the medullary dorsal horn receiving trigeminal nerve sensory innervation and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). LC is a major source of CNS noradrenaline (NA) and a primary nucleus involved in pain modulation. Although descending inhibition of acute pain by LC is well established, contribution of the LC to facilitation of chronic neuropathic pain is also reported. In the present study, a rat orofacial pain model of trigeminal neuropathy was induced by chronic constrictive injury of the infraorbital nerve (CCI-ION). Orofacial neuropathic pain was indicated by development of whisker pad mechanical hypersensitivity. Hypersensitivity was alleviated by selective elimination of NA neurons, including LC (A6 cell group), with the neurotoxin anti-dopamine-β-hydroxylase saporin (anti-DβH-saporin) microinjected either intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) or into trigeminal spinal nucleus caudalis (spVc). The GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline, administered directly into LC (week 8) inhibited hypersensitivity. This indicates a valence shift in which increased GABAA signaling ongoing in LC after trigeminal nerve injury paradoxically produces excitatory facilitation of the chronic pain state. Microinjection of NAα1 receptor antagonist, benoxathian, into mPFC attenuated whisker pad hypersensitivity, while NAα2 receptor antagonist, idazoxan, was ineffective. Thus, GABAA-mediated activation of NA neurons during CCI-ION can facilitate hypersensitivity through NAα1 receptors in the mPFC. These data indicate LC is a chronic pain generator.

AB  - Abstract
Ingestion of monosodium glutamate (MSG) has been shown to cause headaches in healthy individuals and trigger migraine-like headaches in migraine sufferers. We combined immunohistochemistry, in vivo electrophysiology, and laser Doppler recordings of dural vasculature to investigate the effect of systemic administration of MSG on the trigeminovascular pathway. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the expression of NMDA receptors on nerve fibers innervating dural blood vessels and excitatory amino acid transporter 2 on dural blood vessels. Systemic administration of MSG (50 mg/kg) evoked an increase in ongoing discharge in 5/6 spinal trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (SpVc) neurons with dural input recorded from male and female rats, respectively, as well as lowering their mechanical activation threshold. There were no sex-related differences in these effects of MSG. Neuronal discharge and mechanical sensitization were significantly attenuated by co-injection with the peripherally restricted NMDA receptor antagonist (2R)-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) in both sexes. Systemic administration of MSG induced a 24.5% and 20.6% increase in dural flux in male and female rats, respectively. These results suggest that MSG-induced headache is mediated by the activation of peripheral NMDA receptors and subsequent dural vasodilation. Peripheral NMDA receptors are a potential target for the development of new drugs to treat headaches.

AB  - Abstract
This experiment tested the hypothesis that interlimb transfer of motor performance depends on recruitment of motor control processes that are specialized to the hemisphere contralateral to the arm that is initially trained. Right-handed participants performed a single-joint task, in which reaches were targeted to 4 different distances. While the speed and accuracy was similar for both hands, the underlying control mechanisms used to vary movement speed with distance were systematically different between the arms: the amplitude of the initial acceleration profiles scaled greater with movement speed for the right-dominant arm, while the duration of the initial acceleration profile scaled greater with movement speed for the left-non-dominant arm. These two processes were previously shown to be differentially disrupted by left and right hemisphere damage, respectively. We now hypothesize that task practice with the right arm might reinforce left-hemisphere mechanisms that vary acceleration amplitude with distance, while practice with the left arm might reinforce right-hemisphere mechanisms that vary acceleration duration with distance. We thus predict that following right arm practice, the left arm should show increased contributions of acceleration amplitude to peak velocities, and following left arm practice, the right arm should show increased contributions of acceleration duration to peak velocities. Our findings support these predictions, indicating that asymmetry in interlimb transfer of motor performance, at least in the task used here, depends on recruitment of lateralized motor control processes.

AB  - Abstract
Anxiety disorders are more likely to occur in women than in men, usually emerge during adolescence and exhibit high comorbidity with alcohol use disorders (AUD). Adolescents with high levels of anxiety or heightened reactivity to stress may be at-risk for developing AUD. An approach to analyze if high levels of inborn anxiety predict greater ethanol drinking is to assess the latter variable in subjects classified as high- or low-anxiety responders. The present study assessed ethanol drinking in adolescent, female Wistar, rats classified as high-, low- or average-anxiety responders and exposed or not to restraint stress (RS, Exp. 1). Classification was made through a multivariate index derived from testing anxiety responses in an elevated plus maze and a light–dark box tests. RS was applied after animals had been initiated to ethanol drinking. Intake of sweetened ethanol was unaffected by level of anxiety response. Adolescents with high levels of inborn anxiety exhibited significantly higher intake of unsweetened ethanol than counterparts with standard levels of anxiety, yet this effect was inhibited by RS exposure. Experiment 2 assessed FOS immunoreactivity after RS. Stress induced a significant increase in FOS immunoreactivity at the paraventricular nucleus, yet this effect was unaffected by level of anxiety response. Female adolescents with high levels of basal anxiety may be at-risk for exhibiting increased predisposition for ethanol intake and preference. The study also indicates that stress may exert differential effects on adolescent ethanol intake as a function of the level of anxiety response.

AB  - Abstract
Several lines of evidence indicate group III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) have systemic anti-hyperalgesic effects. We hypothesized this could occur through modulation of TRP channels on nociceptors. This study used a multifaceted approach to examine the interaction between group III mGluRs (mGluR8) and transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) on cutaneous nociceptors in rats. Ca2+ imaging studies demonstrated co-localization and functional coupling of TRPA1 and mGluR8, since 1 μM (S)-3,4-dicarboxyphenylglycine (DCPG) (mGluR8 agonist) significantly reduced Ca2+ mobilization produced by 30 μM mustard oil (MO), a TRPA1 agonist. Behavioral studies demonstrated that 10 mM MO produced mechanical hypersensitivity when topically applied to the hind paw, significantly decreasing paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) from 15 g to 6 g. However, administration of 30 μM DCPG prior to 10 mM MO reversed this hypersensitivity such that PWT was not significantly different from baseline. At the single-fiber level, compared to vehicle, 30 μM MO significantly increased nociceptor activity and decreased mechanical threshold. However, 30 μM DCPG reversed both of these MO-induced effects. Furthermore, DCPG significantly reduced the number of MO-induced mechanically sensitive fibers. Inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) using Rp-cyclic 3′,5′-hydrogen phosphorothioate adenosine triethylammonium salt (RpCAMPS) (PKA inhibitor, 1 and 10 μM) significantly reduced MO-induced Ca2+ mobilization. Taken together, these results show that group III mGluRs negatively modulate TRPA1 activity on cutaneous nociceptors. Furthermore, it is likely that this modulation occurs intracellularly at the level of the cAMP/PKA pathway. This study demonstrates that group III agonists may be effective in the treatment of mechanical hypersensitivity which can develop as a result of inflammation, nerve injury, chemotherapy and other disease states.

AB  - Abstract
Resting-state networks (RSNs) refer to the spontaneous brain activity generated under resting conditions, which maintain the dynamic connectivity of functional brain networks for automatic perception or higher order cognitive functions. Here, Granger causal connectivity analysis (GCCA) was used to explore brain RSNs in the music frog (Babina daunchina) during different behavioral activity phases. The results reveal that a causal network in the frog brain can be identified during the resting state which reflects both brain lateralization and sexual dimorphism. Specifically (1) ascending causal connections from the left mesencephalon to both sides of the telencephalon are significantly higher than those from the right mesencephalon, while the right telencephalon gives rise to the strongest efferent projections among all brain regions; (2) causal connections from the left mesencephalon in females are significantly higher than those in males and (3) these connections are similar during both the high and low behavioral activity phases in this species although almost all electroencephalograph (EEG) spectral bands showed higher power in the high activity phase for all nodes. The functional features of this network match important characteristics of auditory perception in this species. Thus we propose that this causal network maintains auditory perception during the resting state for unexpected auditory inputs as resting-state networks do in other species. These results are also consistent with the idea that females are more sensitive to auditory stimuli than males during the reproductive season. In addition, these results imply that even when not behaviorally active, the frogs remain vigilant for detecting external stimuli.

AB  - Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality world-wide and can result in persistent cognitive, sensory and behavioral dysfunction. Understanding the time course of TBI-induced pathology is essential to effective treatment outcomes. We induced TBI in rats using an impact acceleration method and tested for sensorimotor skill and sensory sensitivity behaviors for two weeks to find persistently poor outcomes post-injury. At two weeks post-injury we made high resolution extracellular recordings from barrel cortex neurons, to simple and complex whisker deflections. We found that the supragranular suppression of neural firing (compared to normal) previously seen in the immediate post-TBI aftermath had spread to include suppression of input and infragranular layers at two weeks post-injury; thus, there was suppression of whisker-driven firing rates in all cortical layers to both stimulus types. Further, there were abnormalities in temporal response patterns such that in layers 3–5 there was a temporal broadening of response patterns in response to both whisker deflection stimulus types and in L2 a narrowing of temporal patterns in response to the complex stimulus. Thus, at two weeks post-TBI, supragranular hypo-excitation has evolved to include deep cortical layers likely as a function of progressive atrophy and neurodegeneration. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that TBI alters the delicate excitatory/inhibitory balance in cortex and likely contributes to temporal broadening of responses and restricts the ability to code for complex sensory stimuli.

AB  - Abstract
Despite advances in surgery, patients with nerve injuries frequently have functional deficits. We previously demonstrated in a rat model that daily electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) following peripheral nerve injury and repair enhances reinnervation, detectable as early as two weeks post-injury. In this study, we explain the enhanced early reinnervation observed with electrical stimulation. In two groups of rats, the tibial nerve was transected and immediately repaired. Gastrocnemius muscles were implanted with intramuscular electrodes for sham or muscle stimulation. Muscles were stimulated daily, eliciting 600 contractions for one hour/day, repeated five days per week. Sixteen days following nerve injury, muscles were assessed for functional reinnervation by motor unit number estimation methods using electromyographic recording. In a separate cohort of rats, surgical and electrical stimulation procedures were identical but muscles and distal nerve stumps were harvested for molecular analysis. We observed that stimulated muscles had significantly higher motor unit number counts. Intramuscular levels of brain-derived and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF and GDNF) mRNA were significantly upregulated in muscles that underwent daily electrical stimulation compared to those without stimulation. The corresponding levels of trophic factor mRNA within the distal stump were not different from one another, indicating that the intramuscular electrical stimulus does not modulate Schwann cell-derived trophic factor transcription. Stimulation over a three-month period maintained elevated muscle-derived GDNF but not BDNF mRNA. In conclusion, EMS elevates intramuscular trophic factor mRNA levels which may explain how EMS enhances neural regeneration following nerve injury.

AB  - Abstract
This study tested the hypothesis that the hypothalamus participates in the decompensatory phase of hemorrhage by measuring Fos immunoreactivity and by inhibiting neuronal activity in selected hypothalamic nuclei with lidocaine or cobalt chloride. Previously, we reported that inactivation of the arcuate nucleus inhibited, but did not fully prevent, the fall in arterial pressure evoked by hypotensive hemorrhage. Here, we report that hemorrhage (2.2 ml/100 g body weight over 20 min) induced Fos expression in a high percentage of cells in the paraventricular, supraoptic and arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus as shown previously. Lower densities of Fos immunoreactive cells were also found in the medial preoptic area (mPOA), anterior hypothalamus, lateral hypothalamus (LH), dorsomedial hypothalamus, ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and posterior hypothalamus. Bilateral injection of lidocaine (2%; 0.1 μl or 0.3 μl) or cobalt chloride (5 mM; 0.3 μl) into the tuberal portion of the LH immediately before hemorrhage was initiated reduced the magnitude of hemorrhagic hypotension and bradycardia significantly. Lidocaine injection into the VMH also attenuated the fall in arterial pressure and heart rate evoked by hemorrhage although inactivation of the mPOA or rostral LH was ineffective. These findings indicate that hemorrhage activates neurons throughout much of the hypothalamus and that a relatively broad area of the hypothalamus, extending from the arcuate nucleus laterally through the caudal VMH and tuberal LH, plays an important role in the decompensatory phase of hemorrhage.

AB  - Abstract
Despite the vast improvements of cell therapy in spinal cord injury treatment, no optimum protocol has been developed for application of neural stem/progenitor cells. In this regard, the present meta-analysis showed that the efficacy of the neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) transplantation depends mainly on injury model, intervention phase, transplanted cell count, immunosuppressive use, and probably stem cell source. Improved functional recovery post NSPC transplantation was found to be higher in transection and contusion models. Moreover, NSPC transplantation in acute phase of spinal injury was found to have better functional recovery. Higher doses (&gt;3 × 106 cell/kg) were also shown to be optimum for transplantation, but immunosuppressive agent administration negatively affected the motor function recovery. Scaffold use in NSPC transplantation could also effectively raise functional recovery.

AB  - Abstract
The thalamic reticular nucleus was investigated in one group of crocodilians, Caiman crocodilus. This neuronal aggregate is composed of two parts: a compact portion and a diffuse region made up of scattered cells within the forebrain bundles. In Caiman, both the lateral and medial forebrain bundles project to the telencephalon and the thalamic reticular nucleus is associated with each fiber tract. In the lateral forebrain bundle, the compact area is termed the nucleus of the dorsal peduncle (dorsal peduncular nucleus) while the diffuse part is called the perireticular area. In the medial forebrain bundle, the interstitial nucleus comprises one part of the compact area while another region without a specific neuronal label is also present. Similar to the perireticular cells of the lateral forebrain bundle, scattered cells are also present in the medial forebrain bundle. Morphological features of the thalamic reticular nucleus are revealed with stains for the following: fibers; cells; succinic acid dehydrogenase; and acetylcholinesterase. Regardless of which dorsal thalamic nucleus was injected, a localized region of the thalamic reticular nucleus contained retrogradely labeled cells and anterogradely labeled axons and terminals. This grouping was termed clusters and was felt to represent the densest interconnection between the dorsal thalamus and the reticular nucleus. Using clusters as an index of interconnections, the reticular nucleus was divided into sectors, each of which was associated with a specific dorsal thalamic nucleus. An organization similar to that found in Caiman is present in other sauropsids as well as in mammals. These data suggest that a thalamic reticular nucleus is present in all amniotes and has morphological properties similar to those described in this analysis. Lastly, a hypothesis is presented to explain how the external shape of the reticular nucleus in Caiman might be transformed into the homologous area in a representative bird and mammal.

AB  - Abstract
The processing of nociceptive, visual, vibrotactile, thermal and acoustic stimuli during sleep has been extensively investigated in the past. Recently, interest has focused on the impact of olfactory stimulation on sleep. In contrast to all other sensory systems, olfactory stimulation does not lead to an increased arousal frequency, regardless of hedonicity and concentration. The impact of the second chemosensory system, gustation, on sleep however has not been investigated to date.

Twenty-one normosmic and normogeusic volunteers of both genders, aged 19–33 years, participated in the trial. Stimulation was performed with a gustometer using the following aqueous solutions: saccharose 20% (sweet), sodium chloride (NaCl) 7.5% (salty), citrate 5% (sour), and quinine 0.02% (bitter). A tasteless solution was used as negative control. Capsaicin, a strong trigeminal stimulus, served as positive control. Primary outcome was arousal frequency per stimulus in each sleep stage, as assessed with polysomnography.

The frequency of arousals decreased in deeper sleep stages (N1: 211 arousals of 333 stimuli = 63%, N2: 676/2728 = 25%, N3: 43/1378 = 3%, REM: 57/1010 = 6%). Statistically significant differences in terms of arousal frequency were found in N2 between the negative control and NaCl 100 μl (p &lt; 0.001), saccharose 100 μl, citrate 50 μl &amp; 100 μl, and quinine 100 μl (p &lt; 0.05). Capsaicin led to complete awakenings in 94% of stimuli (30/32).

These results demonstrate that gustatory stimulation during sleep induces arousals depending on stimulus intensity and sleep stage, which is different to olfactory stimulation and may be related to differences in central processing of the two chemosensory systems.

AB  - Abstract
Interneurons are inhibitory neurons, which protect neural tissue from excessive excitation. They are interconnected with glutamatergic pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex and regulate their function. Particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), interneurons have been strongly implicated in regulating pathological states which display deficits in the PFC. The aim of this study is to investigate the adaptations in the adult glutamatergic system, when defects in interneuron development do not allow adequate numbers of interneurons to reach the cerebral cortex. To this end, we used a mouse model that displays ∼50% fewer cortical interneurons due to the Rac1 protein loss from Nkx2.1/Cre expressing cells (Rac1 conditional knockout (cKO) mice), to examine how the developmental loss of interneurons may affect basal synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity and neuronal morphology in the adult PFC. Despite the decrease in the number of interneurons, basal synaptic transmission, as examined by recording field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) from layer II networks, is not altered in the PFC of Rac1 cKO mice. However, there is decreased paired-pulse ratio (PPR) and decreased long-term potentiation (LTP), in response to tetanic stimulation, in the layer II PFC synapses of Rac1 cKO mice. Furthermore, expression of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) subunits is decreased and dendritic morphology is altered, changes that could underlie the decrease in LTP in the Rac1 cKO mice. Finally, we find that treating Rac1 cKO mice with diazepam in early postnatal life can reverse changes in dendritic morphology observed in non-treated Rac1 cKO mice. Therefore, our data show that disruption in GABAergic inhibition alters glutamatergic function in the adult PFC, an effect that could be reversed by enhancement of GABAergic function during an early postnatal period.

AB  - Abstract
Loss of cholinergic neurons in the mesencephalic locomotor region, comprising the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) and the cuneiform nucleus (CnF), is related to gait disturbances in late stage Parkinson’s disease (PD). We investigate the effect of anterior or posterior cholinergic lesions of the PPN on gait-related motor behavior, and on neuronal network activity of the PPN area and basal ganglia (BG) motor loop in rats.

Anterior PPN lesions, posterior PPN lesions or sham lesions were induced by stereotaxic microinjection of the cholinergic toxin AF64-A or vehicle in male Sprague–Dawley rats. First, locomotor activity (open field), postural disturbances (Rotarod) and gait asymmetry (treadmill test) were assessed. Thereafter, single-unit and oscillatory activities were measured in the non-lesioned area of the PPN, the CnF and the entopeduncular nucleus (EPN), the BG output region, with microelectrodes under urethane anesthesia. Additionally, ECoG was recorded in the motor cortex.

Injection of AF64-A into the anterior and posterior PPN decreased cholinergic cell counts as compared to naive controls (P &lt; 0.001) but also destroyed non-cholinergic cells. Only anterior PPN lesions decreased the front limb swing time of gait in the treadmill test, while not affecting other gait-related parameters tested. Main electrophysiological findings were that anterior PPN lesions increased the firing activity in the CnF (P &lt; 0.001). Further, lesions of either PPN region decreased the coherence of alpha (8–12 Hz) band between CnF and motor cortex (MCx), and increased the beta (12–30 Hz) oscillatory synchronization between EPN and the MCx.

Lesions of the PPN in rats had complex effects on oscillatory neuronal activity of the CnF and the BG network, which may contribute to the understanding of the pathophysiology of gait disturbance in PD.

AB  - Abstract
It is claimed that a correlation exists between disturbance of circadian rhythms by factors such as alteration of normal light–dark cycle and the development of addiction. However, the exact mechanisms involved in this relationship are not much understood. Here we have studied the effect of constant light on morphine voluntary consumption and withdrawal symptoms and also investigated the involvement of Per1, Per2 and dopamine D1 receptor in these processes. Male wistar rats were kept under standard (LD) or constant light (LL) conditions for one month. The plasma concentration of melatonin was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Real-time PCR was used to determine the mRNA expression of Per1, Per2 and dopamine D1 receptor in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. Morphine preference (50 mg/L) was evaluated in a two-bottle-choice paradigm for 10 weeks and withdrawal symptoms were recorded after administration of naloxone (3 mg/kg). One month exposure to constant light resulted in a significant decrease of melatonin concentration in the LL group. In addition, mRNA levels of Per2 and dopamine D1 receptor were up-regulated in both the striatum and prefrontal cortex of the LL group. However, expression of Per1 gene was only up-regulated in the striatum of LL rats in comparison to LD animals. Furthermore, after one month exposure to constant light, morphine consumption and preference ratio and also severity of naloxone-induced withdrawal syndrome were significantly greater in LL animals. It is concluded that exposure to constant light by up-regulation of Per2 and dopamine D1 receptor in the striatum and prefrontal cortex and up-regulation of Per1 in the striatum and the possible involvement of melatonin makes animals vulnerable to morphine preference and addiction.

AB  - Abstract
Dopamine (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play a key role in the neurobiological basis of goal-directed behaviors and addiction. Morphine (MOR) withdrawal induces acute and long-term changes in the morphology and physiology of VTA DA cells, but the mechanisms underlying these modifications are poorly understood.

Because of their predictive value, computational models are a powerful tool in neurobiological research, and are often used to gain further insights and deeper understanding on the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the development of various psychiatric disorders.

Here we present a biophysical model of a DA VTA neuron based on 3D morphological reconstruction and electrophysiological data, showing how opiates withdrawal-driven morphological and electrophysiological changes could affect the firing rate and discharge pattern.

The model findings suggest how and to what extent a change in the balance of GABA/GLU inputs can take into account the experimentally observed hypofunction of VTA DA neurons during acute and prolonged withdrawal, whereas morphological changes may play a role in the increased excitability of VTA DA cell to opiate administration observed during opiate withdrawal.

AB  - Abstract
When the human brain encounters a conflict, performance is often impaired. Two tasks that are widely used to induce and measure conflict-related interference are the Eriksen flanker task, whereby the visual target stimulus is flanked by congruent or incongruent distractors, and the Simon task, where the location of the required spatial response is either congruent or incongruent with the location of the target stimulus. Interestingly, both tasks share the characteristic of inducing response conflict but only the flanker task induces stimulus conflict. We used a non-invasive brain stimulation technique to explore the role of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in dealing with conflict in the Eriksen flanker and Simon tasks. In different sessions, participants received anodal, cathodal, or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) (2 mA, 20 min) on the right DLPFC while performing these tasks. The results indicate that cathodal tDCS over the right DLPFC increased the flanker interference effect while having no impact on the Simon effect. This finding provides empirical support for the role of the right DLPFC in stimulus–stimulus rather than stimulus–response conflict, which suggests the existence of multiple, domain-specific control mechanisms underlying conflict resolution. In addition, methodologically, the study also demonstrates the way in which brain stimulation techniques can reveal subtle yet important differences between experimental paradigms that are often assumed to tap into a single process.

AB  - Abstract
The activity of the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) neurons conveys the bulk of the output of the cerebellum. To generate these motor signals, DCN neurons integrate synaptic inputs with their own spontaneous activity. We have previously reported that N-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels modulate the spontaneous activity of the majority of juvenile DCN neurons in vitro. Specifically, pharmacologically blocking N-type Ca2+ channels increases their firing rate causing DCN cells to burst. Adult DCN neurons however, behaved differently. To further investigate this change, we have studied here the effect of cadmium on the firing rate of DCN neurons in acute cerebellar slices obtained from adult (&gt;2 months old) or juvenile (12–21 days old) rats and mice. Strikingly, and in contrast to juvenile DCN cells, cadmium did not affect the pacemaking of adult DCN cells. The activity of Purkinje cells (PCs) however was transformed into high-frequency bursting, regardless the age. Further, we questioned whether these findings could be due to an artifact associated with the added difficulty of preparing adult DCN slices. Hence we proceeded to examine the spontaneous activity of DCN neurons in anesthetized juvenile and adult rats and mice in vivo. When cadmium was injected into the DCN in vivo no significant change in firing rate was observed, conversely to most juvenile DCN neurons which showed high-frequency bursts after cadmium injection. In these same animals, PCs pacemaking showed no developmental difference. Thus our results demonstrate a remarkable age-dependent functional modification in the regulation of DCN neurons pacemaking.

The stochastic resonance (SR) is a phenomenon of nonlinear systems in which the addition of an intermediate level of noise improves the response of such system. Although SR has been studied in isolated hair cells and in the bullfrog sacculus, the occurrence of this phenomenon in the vestibular system in development is unknown. The purpose of the present study was to explore for the existence of SR via natural mechanical-stimulation in the hair cell-vestibular primary afferent transmission. In vitro experiments were performed on the posterior semicircular canal of the chicken inner ear during development. Our experiments showed that the signal-to-noise ratio of the afferent multiunit activity from E15 to P5 stages of development exhibited the SR phenomenon, which was characterized by an inverted U-like response as a function of the input noise level. The inverted U-like graphs of SR acquired their higher amplitude after the post-hatching stage of development. Blockage of the synaptic transmission with selective antagonists of the NMDA and AMPA/Kainate receptors abolished the SR of the afferent multiunit activity. Furthermore, computer simulations on a model of the hair cell – primary afferent synapse qualitatively reproduced this SR behavior and provided a possible explanation of how and where the SR could occur. These results demonstrate that a particular level of mechanical noise on the semicircular canals can improve the performance of the vestibular system in their peripheral sensory processing even during embryonic stages of development.

Recent experimental and modeling studies on the lateral amygdala (LA) have implicated intrinsic excitability and competitive synaptic interactions among principal neurons (PNs) in the formation of auditory fear memories. The present modeling studies, conducted over an expanded range of intrinsic excitability in the network, revealed that only excitable PNs that received tone inputs participate in the competition. Strikingly, the number of model PNs integrated into the fear memory trace remained constant despite the much larger range considered, and model runs highlighted several conditioning-induced tone responsive characteristics of the various PN populations. Furthermore, these studies showed that although excitation was important, disynaptic inhibition among PNs is the dominant mechanism that keeps the number of plastic PNs stable despite large variations in the network’s excitability. Finally, we found that the overall level of inhibition in the model network determines the number of projection cells integrated into the fear memory trace.

AB  - Abstract
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social cognition, disordered communication, restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. Furthermore, abnormalities in basic motor control, skilled motor gestures, and motor learning, are common in ASD. These characteristics have been attributed to a possible defect in the pre- and postnatal development of specific neural networks including the dentate-thalamo-cortical pathway, which is involved in motor learning, automaticity of movements, and higher cognitive functions.

The current study utilized custom diolistic labeling and unbiased stereology to characterize morphological alterations in neurons of the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum in developing rat pups exposed to abnormally high levels of the serotonergic agonist 5-methyloxytryptamine (5-MT) pre-and postnatally. Occurring in as many as 30% of autistic subjects, developmental hyperserotonemia (DHS) is the most consistent neurochemical finding reported in autism and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of ASD. This exposure produced dramatic changes in dendritic architecture and synaptic features. We observed changes in the dendritic branching morphology which did not lead to significant differences (p &gt; 0.5) in total dendritic length. Instead, DHS groups presented with dendritic trees that display changes in arborescence, that appear to be short reaching with elaborately branched segments, presenting with significantly fewer (p &gt; 0.001) dendritic spines and a decrease in numeric density when compared to age-matched controls. These negative changes may be implicated in the neuropathological and functional/behavioral changes observed in ASD, such as delays in motor learning, difficulties in automaticity of movements, and deficits in higher cognitive functions.

AB  - Abstract
Biases in facial expression recognition can be reduced successfully using feedback-based training tasks. Here we investigate with event-related potentials (ERPs) at which stages of stimulus processing emotion-related modulations are influenced by training. Categorization of subtle facial expressions (morphed from neutral to happy, sad or surprise) was trained with correct-response feedback on each trial. ERPs were recorded before and after training while participants categorized facial expressions without response feedback. Behavioral data demonstrated large improvements in categorization of subtle facial expression which transferred to new face models not used during training. ERPs were modulated by training from 450 ms post-stimulus onward, characterized by a more gradual increase in P3b/Late Positive Potential (LPP) amplitude as expression intensity increased. This effect was indistinguishable for faces used for training and for new faces. It was proposed that training elicited a more fine-grained analysis of facial information for all subtle expressions, resulting in improved recognition and enhanced emotional motivational salience (reflected in P3b/LPP amplitude) of faces previously categorized as expressing no emotion.

AB  - Abstract
Studies on perceptual decision-making showed that manipulating the proportion of target and non-target stimuli affects the behavioral performance. Tasks with high frequency of targets are associated to faster response times (RTs) conjunctively to higher number of errors (reflecting a response bias characterized by speed/accuracy trade-off) when compared to conditions with low frequency of targets. Electroencephalographic studies well described modulations of post-stimulus event-related potentials as effect of the stimulus probability; in contrast, in the present study we focused on the pre-stimulus preparatory activities subtending the response bias. Two versions of a Go/No-go task characterized by different proportion of Go stimuli (88% vs. 12%) were adopted. In the task with frequent go trials, we observed a strong enhancement in the motor preparation as indexed by the Bereitschaftspotential (BP, previously associated with activity within the supplementary motor area), faster RTs, and larger commission error rate than in the task with rare go trials. Contemporarily with the BP, a right lateralized prefrontal negativity (lateral pN, previously associated with activity within the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) was larger in the task with rare go trial. In the post-stimulus processing stage, we confirmed that the N2 and the P3 components were larger for rare trials, irrespective of the Go/No-go stimulus category. The increase of activities recorded in the preparatory phase related to frequency of targets is consistent with the view proposed in accumulation models of perceptual decision for which target frequency affects the subjective baseline, reducing the distance between the starting-point and the response boundary, which determines the response speed.

AB  - Abstract
Hypertension is associated with neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive impairment. Several studies using spontaneous hypertensive rats to study the effect of hypertension on memory performance and adult hippocampal neurogenesis have reached inconsistent conclusions. The contradictory findings may be related to the genetic variability of spontaneous hypertensive rats due to the conventional breeding practices. The objective of this study is to examine the effect of hypertension on hippocampal structure and function in isogenic mice. Hypertension was induced by the ‘2 kidneys, 1 clip’ method (2K1C) which constricted one of the two renal arteries. The blood pressures of 2K1C mice were higher than the sham group on post-operation day 7 and remained high up to day 28. Mice with 2K1C-induced hypertension had impaired long-term, but not short-term, memory. Dendritic complexity of CA1 neurons and hippocampal neurogenesis were reduced by 2K1C-induced hypertension on post-operation day 28. Furthermore, 2K1C decreased the levels of hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor, while blood vessel density and activation status of astrocytes and microglia were not affected. In conclusion, hypertension impairs hippocampus-associated long-term memory, dendritic arborization and neurogenesis, which may be caused by down-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathways.

AB  - Abstract
Protein 14-3-3 is a reliable marker of rapid neuronal damage, specifically increased in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (sCJD) patients. Its detection is usually performed by Western Blot (WB), prone to methodological issues. Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of a recently developed quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) assay for 14-3-3γ, in comparison with WB and other neurodegeneration markers. CSF samples from 145 patients with suspicion of prion disease, later classified as definite sCJD (n = 72) or Non-prion diseases (Non-CJD; n = 73) comprised our population. 14-3-3 protein was determined by WB and ELISA. Total Tau (t-Tau) and phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau) were also evaluated. Apolipoprotein E gene (ApoE) and prionic protein gene (PRNP) genotyping was assessed. ELISA 14-3-3γ levels were significantly increased in sCJD compared to Non-CJD patients (p &lt; 0.001), showing very good accuracy (AUC = 0.982; sensitivity = 97%; specificity = 94%), and matching WB results in 81% of all cases. It strongly correlated with t-Tau and p-Tau (p &lt; 0.0001), showing slightly higher specificity (14-3-3 WB – 63%; Tau – 90%; p-Tau/t-Tau ratio – 88%). From WB inconclusive results (n = 44), ELISA 14-3-3γ correctly classified 41 patients. Additionally, logistic regression analysis selected ELISA 14-3-3γ as the best single predictive marker for sCJD (overall accuracy = 93%). ApoE and PRNP genotypes did not influence ELISA 14-3-3γ levels. Despite specificity for 14-3-3γ isoform, ELISA results not only match WB evaluation but also help discrimination of inconclusive results. Our results therefore reinforce this assay as a single screening test, allowing higher sample throughput and unequivocal results.

AB  - Abstract
GLE1 mutations cause lethal congenital contracture syndrome 1 (LCCS1), a severe autosomal recessive fetal motor neuron disease, and more recently have been associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The gene encodes a highly conserved protein with an essential role in mRNA export. The mechanism linking Gle1 function to motor neuron degeneration in humans has not been elucidated, but increasing evidence implicates abnormal RNA processing as a key event in the pathogenesis of several motor neuron diseases. Homozygous gle1−/− mutant zebrafish display various aspects of LCCS, showing severe developmental abnormalities including motor neuron arborization defects and embryonic lethality. A previous gene expression study on spinal cord from LCCS fetuses indicated that oligodendrocyte dysfunction may be an important factor in LCCS. We therefore set out to investigate the development of myelinating glia in gle1−/− mutant zebrafish embryos. While expression of myelin basic protein (mbp) in hindbrain oligodendrocytes appeared relatively normal, our studies revealed a prominent defect in Schwann cell precursor proliferation and differentiation in the posterior lateral line nerve. Other genes mutated in LCCS have important roles in Schwann cell development, thereby suggesting that Schwann cell deficits may be a common factor in LCCS pathogenesis. These findings illustrate the potential importance of glial cells such as myelinating Schwann cells in motor neuron diseases linked to RNA processing defects.

AB  - Abstract
Epigallo-catechin-3-gallate (EGCG), found in the leaves of Camellia sinensis (green tea), has antioxidant- and scavenger-functions and acts neuroprotectively. It has been publicized as anti-aging remedy but data on potential cellular mechanisms are scarce. Recent studies claimed that EGCG specifically promotes neural precursor cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus of C57Bl/6 mice, without changes at the level of immature and mature new neurons. We here analyzed the effects of EGCG on adult hippocampal neurogenesis in male Balb/C mice and saw a different pattern. Two weeks of treatment with EGCG (0, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg) showed a dose–response curve that peaked at 2.5 mg/kg of EGCG with significantly increased cell survival without affecting cell proliferation but decreasing apoptotic cells. Also, EGCG increased the population of doublecortin-(DCX)-expressing cells that comprises the late intermediate progenitor cells (type-2b and -3) as well as immature neurons. After EGCG treatment, the young DCX-positive neurons showed more elaborated dendritic trees. EGCG also significantly increased net neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus and increased the hippocampal levels of phospho-Akt. Ex vivo, EGCG exerted a direct effect on survival and neuronal differentiation of adult hippocampal precursor cells, which was absent, when PI3K, a protein upstream of Akt, was blocked. Our results thus support a pro-survival and a pro-neurogenic role of EGCG. In the context of the conflicting published results, however, potential genetic modifiers must be assumed. These might help to explain the overall variability of study results with EGCG. Our data do indicate, however, that natural compounds such as EGCG can in principle modulate brain plasticity.

AB  - Abstract
The metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) regulates neurogenesis in the brain, but the effect of mGluR5 on retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) remains unknown. In this study, we found that mGluR5 promoted the proliferation of rat RPCs with activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI-3-K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in vitro. The mGluR5 agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine hydrate (DHPG) increased the cellular viability in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, whereas the mGluR5 antagonist 6-methyl-2-(phenylethynyl)pyridine hydrochloride (MTEP) had the opposite effect, as shown by 3-((2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl)pyridine hydrochloride (MTT) assay. Treatment with DHPG (100 μM) also promoted the proliferation of RPCs, as indicated by 5-Bromo-2-deoxyUridine (BrdU) staining and flow cytometry, and likewise, MTEP (100 μM) and mGluR5 knockdown abolished the action of mGluR5 activity. Western blot demonstrated that the activation of mGluR5 enhanced the expression of Cyclin D1 and the phosphorylation level of PKC however, MTEP or mGluR5 knockdown also abrogated the effect of DHPG on RPCs. Furthermore, we found that activation of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) and protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathways was involved in the proliferation of RPC. After DHPG treatment, the levels of both p-ERK1/2 and p-AKT increased in a time-dependent manner. Then we used MTEP, mGluR5 knockdown, the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 and the AKT inhibitor LY294002 to pretreat the cells, and all of them clearly eliminated the influence of DHPG. These results demonstrated that mGluR5 regulates neurogenesis in RPCs through the MAPK and PI-3-K signaling pathways, and these findings may motivate a pharmacological study investigating a potential mechanism for the treatment of retinal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

Background: The increase in corticospinal excitability in response to anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) may contribute to decrease neuromuscular fatigability. Objective: This study investigated the effects of a-tDCS on neuromuscular fatigability in relation with changes in corticospinal excitability. Methods: Eleven adults participated in two experimental sessions consisting of two submaximal voluntary contractions (35% maximal torque) performed to failure, one hour apart with the right elbow flexor muscles. Sham stimulation (90 s) and a-tDCS (10 min) were applied in two separate sessions 10 min prior to the second fatiguing contraction. Corticospinal excitability was assessed by recording motor-evoked potential (MEP), elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex, in biceps brachii, brachioradialis and triceps brachii during the first (C1) and second (C2) fatiguing contractions. The silent period (SP) in electromyogramme (EMG) that followed MEP was also recorded for biceps brachii and brachioradialis. Results: Time to failure was briefer for C2 than C1 in both experimental sessions, but the decrease was less pronounced after a-tDCS (−14.4 ± 12.7%) than sham stimulation (−23.3 ± 11.9%; p = 0.04). MEP amplitude (+9.7 ± 4.0%) and SP duration (+22.5 ± 12.8%) in biceps brachii and brachioradialis increased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) during C1 and C2, but to a similar extent in both sessions (p &gt; 0.05). A similar result was observed for MEP amplitude in triceps brachii. No association was found between changes in time to task failure of C2 and corticospinal excitability. Conclusion: The reduced neuromuscular fatigability induced by a-tDCS does not rely on changes in the excitability of the corticospinal pathway of both agonist and antagonist muscles.

AB  - Abstract
The basal ganglia, a network of subcortical structures, play a critical role in movements, sleep and mental behavior. Basal ganglia disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease affect sleep. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) to treat motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease can ameliorate sleep disturbances. Our series of previous studies lead the hypothesis that dopamine, acting on D2 receptors on the striatopallidal terminals, enhances activity in the globus pallidus externa (GPe) and promotes sleep. Here, we tested if DBS in the GPe promotes sleep in rats. We found that unilateral DBS (180 Hz at 100 μA) in the GPe in rats significantly increased both non-rapid eye movement and rapid eye movement sleep compared to sham DBS stimulation. The EEG power spectrum of sleep induced by DBS was similar to that of the baseline sleep, and sleep latency was not affected by DBS. The GPe is potentially a better site for DBS to treat both insomnia and motor disorders caused by basal ganglia dysfunction.

AB  - Abstract
The angiotensin II (ANGII) receptor AT1 plays an important role in the control of hydromineral balance, mediating the dipsogenic and natriorexigenic effects and neuroendocrine responses of ANGII. While estradiol (E2) is known to modulate several actions of ANGII in the brain, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of the interaction between E2 and ANGII and its physiological role in the control of body fluids remain unclear. We investigated the influence of E2 (40 μg/kg) pretreatment and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cell signaling on the dipsogenic and natriorexigenic effects, as well as the neuroendocrine responses to angiotensinergic central stimulation in ovariectomized rats (OVX). We showed that the inhibitory effect of E2 on ANGII-induced water and sodium intake requires the ERK1/2 and JNK signaling pathways. On the other hand, E2 pretreatment prevents the ANGII-induced phosphorylation of ERK and JNK in the lamina terminalis. E2 therapy decreased oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) secretion and decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei (SON and PVN, respectively). We found that the AVP secretion induced by ANGII required ERK1/2 signaling, but OT secretion did not involve ERK1/2 signaling. Taken together, these results demonstrate that E2 modulates ANGII-induced water and sodium intake and AVP secretion by affecting the ERK1/2 and JNK pathways in the lamina terminalis and ERK1/2 signaling in the hypothalamic nuclei (PVN and SON) in OVX rats.

The subplate (SP) plays important roles in developmental and functional events in the neocortex, such as thalamocortical and corticofugal projection, cortical oscillation generation and corticocortical connectivity. Although accumulated evidence indicates that SP interneurons are crucial for SP function, the molecular composition of SP interneurons as well as their developmental profile and distribution remain largely unclear. In this study, we systematically investigated dynamic development of SP thickness and chemical marker expression in SP interneurons in distinct cortical regions during the first postnatal month. We found that, although the relative area of the SP in the cerebral cortex significantly declined with postnatal development, the absolute thickness did not change markedly. We also found that somatostatin (SOM), the ionotropic serotonin receptor 3A (5HT3AR), and parvalbumin (PV) reliably identify three distinct non-overlapping subpopulations of SP interneurons. The SOM group, which represents ∼30% of total SP interneurons, expresses neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and calbindin (CB) and colocalizes entirely with neuropeptide Y (NPY). The 5HT3AR group, which accounts for ∼60% of the total interneuronal population, expresses calretinin (CR) and GABA-A receptor subunit delta (GABAARδ). The PV group accounts for ∼10% of total SP interneurons and coexpressed GABAARδ. Moreover, distinct interneuron subtypes show characteristic temporal and spatial distribution in the SP. nNOS+ interneurons in the SP increase from the anterior motor cortex to posterior visual cortex, while CR+ and CB+ interneurons the opposite. Interestedly, the majority of GABAARδ+ neurons in SP are non-GABAergic neurons in contrast to other cortical layers. These findings clarify and extend our understanding of SP interneurons in the developing cerebral cortex and will underpin further study of SP function.

AB  - Abstract
Previous studies in our laboratory showed that the organization and heterogeneous molecular composition of extracellular matrix is associated with the variable cytoarchitecture, connections and specific functions of the vestibular nuclei and two related areas of the vestibular neural circuits, the inferior olive and prepositus hypoglossi nucleus. The aim of the present study is to reveal the organization and distribution of various molecular components of extracellular matrix in the red nucleus, a midbrain premotor center. Morphologically and functionally the red nucleus is comprised of the magno- and parvocellular parts, with overlapping neuronal population. By using histochemical and immunohistochemical methods, the extracellular matrix appeared as perineuronal net, axonal coat, perisynaptic matrix or diffuse network in the neuropil. In both parts of the red nucleus we have observed positive hyaluronan, tenascin-R, link protein, and lectican (aggrecan, brevican, versican, neurocan) reactions. Perineuronal nets were detected with each of the reactions and the aggrecan showed the most intense staining in the pericellular area. The two parts were clearly distinguished on the basis of neurocan and HAPLN1 expression as they have lower intensity in the perineuronal nets of large cells and in the neuropil of the magnocellular part. Additionally, in contrast to this pattern, the aggrecan was heavily labeled in the magnocellular region sharply delineating from the faintly stained parvocellular area. The most characteristic finding was that the appearance of perineuronal nets was related with the neuronal size independently from its position within the two subdivisions of red nucleus. In line with these statements none of the extracellular matrix molecules were restricted exclusively to the magno- or parvocellular division. The chemical heterogeneity of the perineuronal nets may support the recently accepted view that the red nucleus comprises more different populations of neurons than previously reported.

Older adults use a different muscle strategy to cope with postural instability, in which they ‘co-contract’ the muscles around the ankle joint. It has been suggested that this is a compensatory response to age-related proprioceptive decline however this view has never been assessed directly. The current study investigated the association between proprioceptive acuity and muscle co-contraction in older adults. We compared muscle activity, by recording surface electromyography (EMG) from the bilateral tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius medialis (GM) muscles, in young (aged 18–34) and older adults (aged 65–82) during postural assessment on a fixed and sway-referenced surface at age-equivalent levels of sway. We performed correlations between muscle activity and proprioceptive acuity, which was assessed using an active contralateral matching task. Despite successfully inducing similar levels of sway in the two age groups, older adults still showed higher muscle co-contraction. A stepwise regression analysis showed that proprioceptive acuity measured using variable error was the best predictor of muscle co-contraction in older adults. However, despite suggestions from previous research, proprioceptive error and muscle co-contraction were negatively correlated in older adults, suggesting that better proprioceptive acuity predicts more co-contraction. Overall, these results suggest that although muscle co-contraction may be an age-specific strategy used by older adults, it is not to compensate for age-related proprioceptive deficits.

AB  - Abstract
In rat paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVT) neurons, activation of low-threshold calcium (Ca2+) channels triggers a low-threshold spike (LTS) which may be followed by slow afterpotentials that can dramatically influence action potential patterning. Using gluconate-based internal recording solutions, we investigated the properties of a LTS-induced slow afterdepolarization (sADP) observed in a subpopulation of PVT neurons recorded in brain slice preparations. This LTS-induced sADP required T-type Ca2+ channel opening, exhibited variable magnitudes between neurons and a voltage dependency with a maximum near −50 mV. The area under the sADP remained stable during control monitoring, but displayed gradual suppression in media where strontium replaced Ca2+. The sADP was suppressed following bath application of 2-APB or ML204, suggesting engagement of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC)-like channels. Further investigation revealed a reversible suppression during bath applications of membrane permeable cannabinoid receptor (CBR) blockers rimonabant, AM630 or SR144528 suggesting the presence of both CB1Rs and CB2Rs. Similar results were achieved by intracellular, but not bath application of the membrane impermeant CB1R blocker hemopressin, suggesting an intracellular localization of CB1Rs. Data from pharmacologic manipulation of endocannabinoid biosynthetic pathways suggested 2-arachidonlyglycerol (2-AG) as the endogenous cannabinoid ligand, derived via hydrolysis of diacylglycerol (DAG), with the latter formed from the pathway involving phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase D and phosphatic acid phosphohydrolase. The sADP suppression observed during recordings with pipettes containing LY294002, a PI3-kinase inhibitor, suggested a role for PI3kinase in the translocation of these TRPC-like channels to the plasma membrane. Drug-induced attenuation of the availability of 2-AG influences the number of action potentials that surmount the LTS evoked in PVT neurons, implying an ongoing intracellular CBR modulation of neuronal excitability during LTS-induced bursting behavior.

AB  - Abstract
Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a sporadic neurodegenerative disease. The major pathological hallmark of MSA is the accumulation of α-synuclein in oligodendrocytes. In contrast to Parkinson’s disease no definitive familial etiology for MSA has been determined. Yet, there is a growing body of evidence that perturbation of transcriptional processes leads to MSA pathology. Here we present the results of the first ribosomal-depleted strand-specific RNA-sequencing profile of the MSA brain frontal cortex tissue. Among the 123 differentially expressed genes over 50% were categorized as putative long intervening non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs). Along with the dysregulation of the non-coding portion of the transcriptome, the expression of protein coding genes was also affected, including serpin peptidase inhibitor, clade A (alpha-1 antiproteinase, antitrypsin), member 3 (SERPINA3), interleukin 1 receptor-like 1 (IL1RL1) and hemoglobin, beta (HBB). Also of interest was the alternative splicing of SNCA, along with the presence of an antisense transcript overlapping the 3′ exon of SNCA. Moreover, we demonstrate widespread antisense transcription throughout the frontal cortex that is largely not affected by MSA-specific neurodegenerative process. MSA causes a large disruption of lincRNAs in the human brain along with protein coding genes related to iron metabolism and immune response regulation. Most of the lincRNAs specific for MSA were novel. Hence our study uncovers another level of complexity in transcriptional pathology of MSA.

AB  - Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation and deposition of plaques of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide in the brain. Growing epidemiological and experimental studies have shown that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) exerts neuroprotection against AD. However, the underlying mechanisms of the action remain unclear. Since Aβ clearance plays a crucial role in Aβ balance in the brain, the aim of the present study was to investigate potential effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on Aβ1–40, the major soluble oligomeric form of Aβ, clearance via transport across blood–brain barrier (BBB) mediated by low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) (efflux) and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) (influx) and peripheral uptake by liver mediated by LRP1. We identified colocalization of LRP1 and RAGE at BBB of mice, established an in vitro BBB model by culturing monolayer mouse brain microvascular endothelial cell line (bEnd.3) cells under hypoxia and observed that 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment enhanced Aβ1–40 efflux across the BBB model and uptake by HepG2 cells. After 1,25(OH)2D3 exposure, LRP1 expression was increased significantly both in vivo and in vitro, and RAGE expression was reduced in the in vitro BBB model but not in microvascular endothelial cells of mice hippocampus. Additionally, we explored the correlation between the corresponding effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 and its nuclear hormone receptor vitamin D receptor (VDR) level. We found that VDR expression was upregulated after 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment both in vivo and in vitro. Collectively, our finding that 1,25(OH)2D3 reduces cerebral Aβ1–40 level by increasing Aβ1–40 brain-to-blood efflux and peripheral uptake through regulating LRP1 and RAGE could shed light on the mechanism of 1,25(OH)2D3 neuroprotection against AD. And the action of 1,25(OH)2D3 might be associated with the VDR pathway.

AB  - Abstract
Dexras1 is a novel GTPase that acts at a confluence of signaling mechanisms associated with psychiatric and neurological disease including NMDA receptors, NOS1AP and nNOS. Recent work has shown that Dexras1 mediates iron trafficking and NMDA-dependent neurodegeneration but a role for Dexras1 in normal brain function or psychiatric disease has not been studied. To test for such a role, mice with germline knockout (KO) of Dexras1 were assayed for behavioral abnormalities as well as changes in NMDA receptor subunit protein expression. Because Dexras1 is up-regulated during stress or by dexamethasone treatment, we included measures associated with emotion including anxiety and depression. Baseline anxiety-like measures (open field and zero maze) were not altered, nor were depression-like behavior (tail suspension). Measures of memory function yielded mixed results, with no changes in episodic memory (novel object recognition) but a significant decrement on working memory (T-maze). Alternatively, there was an increase in pre-pulse inhibition (PPI), without concomitant changes in either startle amplitude or locomotor activity. PPI data are consistent with the direction of change seen following exposure to dopamine D2 antagonists. An examination of NMDA subunit expression levels revealed an increased expression of the NR2A subunit, contrary to previous studies demonstrating down-regulation of the receptor following antipsychotic exposure (Schmitt et al., 2003) and up-regulation after exposure to isolation rearing (Turnock-Jones et al., 2009). These findings suggest a potential role for Dexras1 in modulating a selective subset of psychiatric symptoms, possibly via its interaction with NMDARs and/or other disease-related binding-partners. Furthermore, data suggest that modulating Dexras1 activity has contrasting effects on emotional, sensory and cognitive domains.

AB  - Abstract
Much of the current understanding of epilepsy mechanisms has been built on data recorded with one or a few electrodes from temporal lobe slices of normal young animals stimulated with convulsants. Mechanisms of adult, extratemporal, neocortical chronic epilepsy have not been characterized as much. A more advanced understanding of epilepsy mechanisms can be obtained by recording epileptiform discharges simultaneously from multiple points of an epileptic focus so as to define their sites of initiation and pathways of spreading. Brain slice recordings can characterize epileptic mechanisms in a simpler, more controlled preparation than in vivo. Yet, the intrinsic hyper-excitability of a chronic epileptic focus may not be entirely preserved in slices following the severing of connections in slice preparation. This study utilizes recordings of multiple electrode arrays to characterize which features of epileptic hyper-excitability present in in vivo chronic adult neocortical epileptic foci are preserved in brain slices.

After tetanus toxin somatosensory cortex injections, adult rats manifest chronic spontaneous epileptic discharges both in the injection site (primary focus) and in the contralateral side (secondary focus). We prepared neocortical slices from these epileptic animals. When perfused with 4-Aminopyridine in a magnesium free medium, epileptic rat slices exhibit higher voltage discharges and broader spreading than control rat slices. Rates of discharges are similar in slices of epileptic and normal rats, however. Ictal and interictal discharges are distributed over most cortical layers, though with significant differences between primary and secondary foci.

A chronic neocortical epileptic focus in slices does not show increased spontaneous pacemakers initiating epileptic discharges but shows discharges with higher voltages and broader spread, consistent with an enhanced synchrony of cellular and synaptic generators over wider surfaces.

AB  - Abstract
Typical abused drug-induced behavioral changes are ordinarily mediated by the mesolimbic dopaminergic system and even the phenotypes of behavior are different from each other. However, the mechanisms that underlie the behavioral changes induced by these abused drugs have not yet been elucidated. The present study was designed to investigate the mechanisms that underlie how abused drugs induce distinct behavioral changes using neurochemical as well as behavioral techniques in rats. Methamphetamine (2 mg/kg) more potently increased dopamine release from the striatum more than that from the nucleus accumbens. In contrast, the administration of morphine (10 mg/kg) produced a significant increase in the release of dopamine from the nucleus accumbens, but not the striatum, which is accompanied by a decrease in the release of GABA in the ventral tegmental area. These findings indicate that morphine and methamphetamine differentially regulate dopaminergic systems to produce behavioral changes, even though both drugs have abuse potential through activation of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic stress is associated with a plethora of cognitive symptoms such as emotional dysregulation and impaired executive function that have been attributed to modifications in neuroanatomy in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and hippocampus (HPC). While many studies have examined stress-induced changes in neuronal morphology, synaptic plasticity, and cellular function, there has been little investigation into persistent changes in gene expression that may be responsible for the maintenance of these changes. This study exposed adult rats to a chronic stressor and then examined changes in mRNA gene expression in the OFC, mPFC and HPC following a two-week withdrawal period. mRNA bio-sequencing results revealed sex- and region-dependent changes. Surprisingly the greatest changes in gene expression were found in the OFC, and similar to anatomical studies, analysis of gene changes with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software demonstrated that the mPFC and OFC exhibited contrasting activation of canonical pathways and functional networks. The HPC demonstrated the largest degree of sex-dependent change in gene expression. In general, chronic stress induced persistent changes in gene expression in the three brain regions we examined and these changes could be associated with the commonly reported cognitive symptoms. The current study highlights the region- and sex-dependent nature of the brain’s response to chronic stress and the difficulty we face when attempting to develop treatment options.

AB  - Abstract
Background: Animal models of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonism have been widely used for schizophrenia research. Less is known whether these models are associated with macroscopic brain structural changes that resemble those in clinical schizophrenia. Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to measure brain structural changes in rats subjected to repeated administration of MK801 in a regimen (daily dose of 0.2 mg/kg for 14 consecutive days) known to be able to induce schizophrenia-like cognitive impairments. Results: Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) revealed significant gray matter (GM) atrophy in the hippocampus, ventral striatum (vStr) and cortex. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) demonstrated microstructural impairments in the corpus callosum (cc). Histopathological results corroborated the MRI findings. Limitations: Treatment-induced behavioral abnormalities were not measured such that correlation between the brain structural changes observed and schizophrenia-like behaviors could not be established. Conclusion: Chronic MK801 administration induces MRI-observable brain structural changes that are comparable to those observed in schizophrenia patients, supporting the notion that NMDAR hypofunction contributes to the pathology of schizophrenia. Imaging-derived brain structural changes in animal models of NMDAR antagonism may be useful measurements for studying the effects of treatments and interventions targeting schizophrenia.

Background and purpose: The initial steps in the cascade leading to cell death are still unknown because of the limitations of the existing methodology, strategy, and modalities used. Methods: Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) was used to measure dynamic molecular changes of phosphatidylcholine (PC) species in the rat hippocampus after transient global ischemia (TGI) for 6 min. Fresh frozen sections were obtained after euthanizing the rats on Days 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, and 21. Histopathology and IMS of adjacent sections compared morphological and molecular changes, respectively. Results: Histopathological changes were absent immediately after TGI (at Day 1, superacute phase). At Days 2–21 after TGI (from subacute to chronic phases), histopathology revealed neuronal death associated with gliosis, inflammation, and accumulation of activated microglia in CA1. IMS detected significant molecular changes after TGI in the same CA1 domain: increase of PC (diacyl-16:0/22:6) in the superacute phase and increase of PC (diacyl-16:0/18:1) in the subacute to chronic phases. Conclusions: Histopathology and IMS can provide comprehensive and complementary information on cell death mechanisms in the hippocampal CA1 after global ischemia. IMS provided novel data on molecular changes in phospholipids immediately after TGI. Increased level of PC (diacyl-16:0/22:6) in the pyramidal cell layer of hippocampal CA1 prior to the histopathological change may represent an early step in delayed neuronal death mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract
Depression is a common neuropsychiatric disorder which has been associated with a wide range of structural and functional changes within specific brain regions. Ginsenoside Rg1 has been shown to exert a number of neuroprotective effects as demonstrated in various in vivo and in vitro studies. However, little information is available regarding the site and mechanisms of ginsenoside Rg1 in promoting antidepressant effects. The present study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective and ameliorating effects of ginsenoside Rg1 on depression-like behavior as induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). The results showed that CUMS was effective in producing depression-like behaviors in rats as indicated by decreased responses in sucrose preference and forced swim tests which were associated with ultrastructural changes in neurons within the amygdala. Moreover, levels of PKA and CREB phosphorylation and the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were decreased in the amygdala of CUMS rats. Remarkably, chronic ginsenoside Rg1 (40 mg/kg, i.p., 5 weeks) treatment significantly ameliorated these behavioral and biochemical alterations associated with CUMS-induced depression. Taken together, the results of the present study demonstrate that ginsenoside Rg1 exhibits antidepressant-like effects against CUMS-induced depression. This amelioration of depression-like behaviors by ginsenoside Rg1 appears to be mediated, at least in part, by a CREB-regulated increase of BDNF expression in the amygdala of rats. Therefore, these findings reveal the therapeutic potential of ginsenoside Rg1 for use in clinical trials in the treatment of depression.

AB  - Abstract
A current hypothesis regarding the mechanism of antidepressant (AD) action suggests the involvement of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Consistent with this hypothesis, the receptor for BDNF (and neurotrophin 4/5 (NT-4/5)), Tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB), is activated in rodents by treatment with classical AD drugs. Vagal nerve stimulation (VNS), a therapy for treatment resistant depression (TRD), also activates TrkB in rodents. However, the role of this receptor in the therapeutic effects of VNS is unclear. In the current study, the involvement of TrkB in the effects of VNS was investigated in rats using its inhibitor, K252a. Anxiolytic-like and AD-like effects were analyzed using the novelty suppressed feeding test (NSFT) and forced swim test (FST), respectively. K252a blocked the anxiolytic-like effect of chronic VNS treatment and the AD-like effect of acute VNS treatment. By contrast, blocking TrkB did not prevent either the anxiolytic-like or AD-like effect of chronic treatment with desipramine (DMI), a selective noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor; it did, however, block the acute effect of DMI in the FST. To examine whether the activation of TrkB caused by either VNS or DMI is ligand-dependent, use was made of TrkB-Fc, a molecular scavenger for ligands of TrkB. Intraventricular administration of TrkB-Fc blocked the acute activation of TrkB induced by either treatment, indicating that treatment-induced activation of this receptor is ligand-dependent. The behavioral results highlight differences in the involvement of TrkB in the chronic effects of an AD drug and a stimulation therapy as well as its role in acute versus chronic effects of DMI.

AB  - Abstract
Repetitive acute intermittent hypoxia (rAIH) increases growth/trophic factor expression in respiratory motor neurons, thereby eliciting spinal respiratory motor plasticity and/or neuroprotection. Here we demonstrate that rAIH effects are not unique to respiratory motor neurons, but are also expressed in non-respiratory, spinal alpha motor neurons and upper motor neurons of the motor cortex. In specific, we used immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence to assess growth/trophic factor protein expression in spinal sections from rats exposed to AIH three times per week for 10 weeks (3 × wAIH). 3 × wAIH increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), its high-affinity receptor, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), and phosphorylated TrkB (pTrkB) immunoreactivity in putative alpha motor neurons of spinal cervical 7 (C7) and lumbar 3 (L3) segments, as well as in upper motor neurons of the primary motor cortex (M1). 3 × wAIH also increased immunoreactivity of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), the high-affinity VEGFA receptor (VEGFR-2) and an important VEGF gene regulator, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). Thus, rAIH effects on growth/trophic factors are characteristic of non-respiratory as well as respiratory motor neurons. rAIH may be a useful tool in the treatment of disorders causing paralysis, such as spinal injury and motor neuron disease, as a pretreatment to enhance motor neuron survival during disease, or as preconditioning for cell-transplant therapies.

AB  - Abstract
Developmental ethanol (EtOH) exposure can lead to long-lasting cognitive impairment, hyperactivity, and emotional dysregulation among other problems. In healthy adults, sleep plays an important role in each of these behavioral manifestations. Here we explored circadian rhythms (activity, temperature) and slow-wave sleep (SWS) in adult mice that had received a single day of EtOH exposure on postnatal day 7 and saline littermate controls. We tested for correlations between slow-wave activity and both contextual fear conditioning and hyperactivity. Developmental EtOH resulted in adult hyperactivity within the home cage compared to controls but did not significantly modify circadian cycles in activity or temperature. It also resulted in reduced and fragmented SWS, including reduced slow-wave bout duration and increased slow-wave/fast-wave transitions over 24-h periods. In the same animals, developmental EtOH exposure also resulted in impaired contextual fear conditioning memory. The impairment in memory was significantly correlated with SWS fragmentation. Furthermore, EtOH-treated animals did not display a post-training modification in SWS which occurred in controls. In contrast to the memory impairment, sleep fragmentation was not correlated with the developmental EtOH-induced hyperactivity. Together these results suggest that disruption of SWS and its plasticity are a secondary contributor to a subset of developmental EtOH exposure’s long-lasting consequences.

AB  - Abstract
Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is associated with increased preference for palatable foods. The hedonic response to sweet taste, modulated by the nucleus accumbens μ-opioid-receptors, may be involved. We investigated hedonic responses and receptor levels in IUGR and Control animals. From pregnancy day 10, Sprague–Dawley dams received either an ad libitum (Control), or a 50% food restricted (FR) diet. At birth, pups were cross-fostered, and nursed by Adlib fed dams. The hedonic response was evaluated at 1 day after birth and at 90 days of life, by giving sucrose solution or water and analyzing the hedonic facial responses (within 60 s). Control pups exposed either to water or sucrose resolved their hedonic responses after 16 and 18 s, respectively, while FR hedonic responses to sucrose persisted over 20 s. FR pups had deceased phospho-μ-opioid-receptor (p = 0.009) and reduced phosphor:total mu opioid receptor ratio compared to controls pups (p = 0.003). In adults, there was an interaction between group and solution at the end of the evaluation (p = 0.044): Control decreased the response after sucrose solution, FR did not change over time. There were no differences in phosphorylation of μ-opioid-receptor in adults. These results demonstrate IUGR newborn rats exhibit alterations in hedonic response accompanied by a decrease in μ-opioid-receptor phosphorylation, though these alterations do not persist at 3 months of age. Opioid system alterations in early life may contribute to the development of preference for highly palatable foods and contribute to rapid weight gain and obesity in IUGR offspring.

AB  - Abstract
Early intermittent cortical activity is thought to play a crucial role in the growth of neuronal network development, and large scale brain networks are known to provide the basis for higher brain functions. Yet, the early development of the large scale synchrony in cortical activations is unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the early intermittent cortical activations seen in the human scalp EEG show a clear developmental course during the last trimester of pregnancy, the period of intensive growth of cortico-cortical connections. We recorded scalp EEG from altogether 22 premature infants at post-menstrual age between 30 and 44 weeks, and the early cortical synchrony was quantified using recently introduced activation synchrony index (ASI). The developmental correlations of ASI were computed for individual EEG signals as well as anatomically and mathematically defined spatial subgroups. We report two main findings. First, we observed a robust and statistically significant increase in ASI in all cortical areas. Second, there were significant spatial gradients in the synchrony in fronto-occipital and left-to-right directions. These findings provide evidence that early cortical activity is increasingly synchronized across the neocortex. The ASI-based metrics introduced in our work allow direct translational comparison to in vivo animal models, as well as hold promise for implementation as a functional developmental biomarker in future research on human neonates.

AB  - Abstract
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an established technique that can modulate excitability of the motor cortex and corticospinal tract, beyond the duration of the stimulation itself. More recently, a newer repetitive technique, known as I-wave periodicity TMS (iTMS) has been purported to show increases in corticospinal excitability following at least 10 min of iTMS duration. The aim of this study was to use a systematic review to search the literature from January 2000 to October 2015 with regard to corticospinal outcomes following iTMS intervention. We also rated the quality of studies and assessed the risk of bias by applying the Downs and Black checklist and the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool respectively. From an initial yield of 144, 11 studies were included. Studies were found to be of moderate quality, however a high risk of bias was identified. Despite these issues, evidence from the studies presented in this review so far indicates that iTMS is effective in increasing corticospinal excitability. However, further studies are required from other groups to validate the findings to date. Additional research is required to reduce the variability in corticospinal excitability and also to functional outcomes along with corticospinal excitability following iTMS.

AB  - Abstract
Polyglutamine expansion in the protein ATAXIN-1 (ATXN1) causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1), an inherited neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor deficits, cognitive impairment and depression. Although ubiquitously expressed, mutant ATXN1 causes neurodegeneration primarily in the cerebellum, which is responsible for the observed motor deficits. The role of ATXN1 outside of the cerebellum and the causes of cognitive deficits and depression in SCA1 are less understood. In this study, we demonstrate a novel role of ATXN1 in the hippocampus as a regulator of adult neurogenesis. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is the process of generating new hippocampal neurons and is linked to cognition and mood. We found that loss of ATXN1 causes a decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis in ATXN1 null (Atxn1−/−) mice. This decrease was caused by reduced proliferation of neural precursors in the hippocampus of Atxn1−/− mice, and persisted even when Atxn1−/− hippocampal neural precursors were removed from their natural environment and grown in vitro, suggesting that ATXN1 affects proliferation in a cell-autonomous manner. Moreover, expression of ATXN1 with a pathological polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in wild-type neural precursor cells inhibited their proliferation.

Our data establish a novel role for ATXN1 in the hippocampus as an intrinsic regulator of precursor cell proliferation, and suggest a mechanism by which polyQ expansion and loss of ATXN1 affect hippocampal function, potentially contributing to cognitive deficits and depression. These results indicate that while depletion of ATXN1 is a promising therapeutic approach to treat the cerebellar aspects of SCA1, this approach should be employed with caution given the potential for side effects on hippocampal function with loss of wild-type ATXN1.

AB  - Abstract
In simultaneous bimanual movements, interference between the hands is always a possibility, particularly when movements are spatially incongruent. In a previous study using bimanual target-directed movements and abrupt visual feedback perturbation of one hand, I showed asymmetric interference from the dominant to the nondominant hand. The signature of that interference reflected the directional control strength of the dominant hand, supporting a recent theory of functional lateralization of arm movements, and extending it to a bimanual context. Nondominant-to-dominant interference was not observed in this task. The current study in healthy young adults used a bimanual paradigm in which one hand had to adapt to a gradual visuomotor perturbation, while the other hand operated under kinesthetic control, without visual feedback. In this arrangement, the kinesthetically guided hand provides a canvas on which the visually guided, and perturbed hand can ‘paint’ its interference. Results of this study showed two patterns of interference: in some participants the nonvisible hand deviated in the same direction (isodirectional) relative to the perturbed hand, in others it mirrored the direction (anisodirectional) of the perturbed hand. In isodirectional participants, dominant-to-nondominant and nondominant-to-dominant hand interference was symmetrical and relatively weak, whereas there was strong nondominant-to-dominant hand interference in anisodirectional participants, suggesting interference in the form of endpoint accuracy control strength of the nondominant hand. Based on these findings, the study discusses potential mechanisms enabling the nondominant hand to exert this control strength onto the dominant hand.

AB  - Abstract
A sound interrupted by silence is perceived as discontinuous. However, when high-intensity noise is inserted during the silence, the missing sound may be perceptually restored and be heard as uninterrupted. This illusory phenomenon is called auditory induction. Recent electrophysiological studies have revealed that auditory induction is associated with the primary auditory cortex (A1). Although experimental evidence has been accumulating, the neural mechanisms underlying auditory induction in A1 neurons are poorly understood. To elucidate this, we used both experimental and computational approaches. First, using an optical imaging method, we characterized population responses across auditory cortical fields to sound and identified five subfields in rats. Next, we examined neural population activity related to auditory induction with high temporal and spatial resolution in the rat auditory cortex (AC), including the A1 and several other AC subfields. Our imaging results showed that tone-burst stimuli interrupted by a silent gap elicited early phasic responses to the first tone and similar or smaller responses to the second tone following the gap. In contrast, tone stimuli interrupted by broadband noise (BN), considered to cause auditory induction, considerably suppressed or eliminated responses to the tone following the noise. Additionally, tone-burst stimuli that were interrupted by notched noise centered at the tone frequency, which is considered to decrease the strength of auditory induction, partially restored the second responses from the suppression caused by BN. To phenomenologically mimic the neural population activity in the A1 and thus investigate the mechanisms underlying auditory induction, we constructed a computational model from the periphery through the AC, including a nonlinear dynamical system. The computational model successively reproduced some of the above-mentioned experimental results. Therefore, our results suggest that a nonlinear, self-exciting system is a key element for qualitatively reproducing A1 population activity and to understand the underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract
The dual task (DT) paradigm has been used to investigate decrements in balance performance while walking and standing in fall prevention studies with older adults. However, there are inconsistent findings whether balance performance decreases or increases in DT situations. Following different theoretical models (e.g. limited resource hypothesis or cross domain competition model), these inconsistent findings can be explained by task settings and task complexity. We compared DT performance in an executive control task (Stroop test) while standing and walking to analyze which theoretical model would fit our data best. Twenty-eight persons (&gt;65 years) were examined under single task (ST) and DT conditions for standing (sway length and sway velocity) and walking (step length, step width (SW), peak forces of the heel, mid- and forefoot).

SW increased from ST to DT conditions, and step length decreased significantly. Maximum forces of the forefoot were reduced whereas the maximum forces of the midfoot increased. Additionally, correct answers of the Stroop test decreased from the ST baseline condition to DT walking. No correlations were found between DT costs (performance decrements) of standing and walking.

For both conditions (standing and walking), the limited resources hypothesis fits best. Moreover, not all modified gait variables could be defined as negative DT costs. Increased SW and decreased step length might be used to compensate influences on lateral stability while demands on motor-cognitive resources increase. Further, drawing conclusions from a standing task for walking conditions might lead to misinterpretations.

AB  - Abstract
Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disease with severe neurological symptoms due to blockage of signal conduction in affected axons. Spontaneous remyelination via endogenous progenitors is limited and eventually fails. Recent reports showed that forced expression of some transcription factors within the brain converted somatic cells to neural progenitors and neuroblasts. Here, we report the effect of valproic acid (VPA) along with forced expression of Oct4 transcription factor on lysolecithin (LPC)-induced experimental demyelination.

Mice were gavaged with VPA for one week, and then inducible Oct4 expressing lentiviral particles were injected into the lateral ventricle. After one-week induction of Oct4, LPC was injected into the optic chiasm. Functional remyelination was assessed by visual-evoked potential (VEP) recording. Myelination level was studied using FluoroMyelin staining and immunohistofluorescent (IHF) against proteolipid protein (PLP). IHF was also performed to detect Oct4 and SSEA1 as pluripotency markers and Olig2, Sox10, CNPase and PDGFRα as oligodendrocyte lineage markers.

One week after injection of Oct4 expressing vector, pluripotency markers SSEA1 and Oct4 were detected in the rims of the 3rd ventricle. LPC injection caused extensive demyelination and significantly delayed the latency of VEP wave. Animals pre-treated with VPA + Oct4 expressing vector, showed faster recovery in the VEP latency and enhanced myelination. Immunostaining against oligodendrocyte lineage markers showed an increased number of Sox10+ and myelinating cells. Moreover, transdifferentiation of some Oct4-transfected cells (GFP+ cells) to Olig2+ and CNPase+ cells was confirmed by immunostaining.

One-week administration of VPA followed by one-week forced expression of Oct4 enhanced myelination by converting transduced cells to myelinating oligodendrocytes. This finding seems promising for enhancing myelin repair within the adult brains.

AB  - Abstract
Detecting others’ action errors plays a critical role in social life. Studies indicate that executing action errors and observing other’s errors activate a specific cerebral system specialized for performance monitoring and detecting mismatches between an internal model of the action and the executed/observed one. Such a system may be particularly important for highly skilled performance. By recording electro-encephalographic (EEG) activity in expert pianists, non-pianist musicians and musically naïve individuals while they observed correct or incorrect mute piano sequences, we explored the link between sensorimotor expertise, the ability to detect another’s erroneous action (indexed by positivity error, Pe) and action simulation (indexed by mu frequency suppression). Superior error detection in pianists was paralleled by a larger Pe, hinting at the selective activation of the parietal error-monitoring system in visuo-motor experts. Moreover, only in pianists did action observation induce left lateralized mu suppression in the 10–12 Hz band, reflecting somatotopic sensorimotor simulation. A mediation analysis showed that mu suppression and performance (indexed by d′) were mediated by Pe amplitude, indicating that the higher the simulation, the higher the sensitivity to errors for large Pe amplitude. This study shows that specific electrocortical indices link motor simulation and detection of errors in the actions of others.

AB  - Abstract
The early pathways underlying the active electric sense of the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus involve three parallel processing streams. An array of tuberous electroreceptors distributed over the skin provides inputs to the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL), forming the basis for three topographic maps: LS (lateral segment), CLS (centrolateral segment), and CMS (centromedial segment). In addition, each map receives topographically preserved inputs from a direct feedback pathway. How this feedback contributes to the distinct spatiotemporal filtering properties of ELL pyramidal neurons across maps is not clear. We used an in vitro approach to characterize short-term plasticity (STP) in the direct feedback synapses onto pyramidal neurons in each map. Our findings indicated that the dynamics of STP varied across maps in a manner that was consistent with the temporal filtering properties of pyramidal neurons in vivo. Using a modeling approach, we found that the STP of direct feedback synapses in CMS was best described by a simple facilitation–depression model. On the other hand, STP in LS was best described by synaptic facilitation with a use-dependent recovery rate. These results suggest that differential regulation of overlapping STP processes in feedback pathways can contribute to the functional specialization of topographic sensory maps.

AB  - Abstract
Protection of substantia nigra (SN) dopaminergic (DA) neurons by neurotrophic factors (NTFs) is one of the promising strategies in Parkinson’s disease (PD) therapy. A major clinical challenge for NTF-based therapy is that NTFs need to be delivered into the brain via invasive means, which often shows limited delivery efficiency. The nose to brain pathway is a non-invasive brain drug delivery approach developed in recent years. Of particular interest is the finding that intranasal insulin improves cognitive functions in Alzheimer’s patients. In vitro, insulin has been shown to protect neurons against various insults. Therefore, the current study was designed to test whether intranasal insulin could afford neuroprotection in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-based rat PD model. 6-OHDA was injected into the right side of striatum to induce a progressive DA neuronal lesion in the ipsilateral SN pars compact (SNc). Recombinant human insulin was applied intranasally to rats starting from 24 h post lesion, once per day, for 2 weeks. A battery of motor behavioral tests was conducted on day 8 and 15. The number of DA neurons in the SNc was estimated by stereological counting. Our results showed that 6-OHDA injection led to significant motor deficits and 53% of DA neuron loss in the ipsilateral side of injection. Treatment with insulin significantly ameliorated 6-OHDA-induced motor impairments, as shown by improved locomotor activity, tapered/ledged beam-walking performance, vibrissa-elicited forelimb-placing, initial steps, as well as methamphetamine-induced rotational behavior. Consistent with behavioral improvements, insulin treatment provided a potent protection of DA neurons in the SNc against 6-OHDA neurotoxicity, as shown by a 74.8% increase in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons compared to the vehicle group. Intranasal insulin treatment did not affect body weight and blood glucose levels. In conclusion, our study showed that intranasal insulin provided strong neuroprotection in the 6-OHDA rat PD model, suggesting that insulin signaling may be a novel therapeutic target in broad neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Population-based studies have demonstrated that children with a history of febrile seizure (FS) perform better than age-matched controls at hippocampus-dependent memory tasks. Here, we report that FSs induce two distinct structural reorganizations in the hippocampus and bidirectionally modify future learning abilities in an age-dependent manner. Compared with age-matched controls, adult mice that had experienced experimental FSs induced by hyperthermia (HT) on postnatal day 14 (P14-HT) performed better in a cognitive task that requires dentate granule cells (DGCs). The enhanced memory performance correlated with an FS-induced persistent increase in the density of large mossy fiber terminals (LMTs) of the DGCs. The memory enhancement was not observed in mice that had experienced HT-induced seizures at P11 which exhibited abnormally located DGCs in addition to the increased LMT density. The ectopic DGCs of the P11-HT mice were abolished by the diuretic bumetanide, and this pharmacological treatment unveiled the masked memory enhancement. Thus, this work provides a novel basis for age-dependent structural plasticity in which FSs influence future brain function.

We used an autologous thromboembolic rat stroke model to assess the additive effects of these treatments for reducing the deleterious effects of hyperglycolysis post-stroke in which reperfusion is induced with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA).

Methods: Sprague–Dawley rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion with an autologous embolus. One hour after occlusion, rt-PA was administered alone or with NBO (60%), EtOH (1.0 g/kg), TH (33 °C), either singly or in combination. Infarct volume and neurological deficit were assessed at 24 h after rt-PA-induced reperfusion with or without other treatments. The extent of hyperglycolysis, as determined by cerebral glucose and lactate levels was evaluated at 3 and 24 h after rt-PA administration. At the same time points, expressions of glucose transporter 1 (Glut1), glucose transporter 3 (Glut3), phosphofructokinase1 (PFK-1), and lactate dehydrogenase were (LDH) measured by Western blotting.

Results: Following rt-PA in rats with thromboembolic stroke, NBO combined with TH or EtOH most effectively decreased infarct volume and neurological deficit. As compared to rt-PA alone, EtOH or TH but not NBO monotherapies significantly reduced post-stroke hyperglycolysis. The increased utilization of glucose and production of lactate post-stroke was prevented most effectively when NBO was combined with either EtOH or TH after reperfusion with rt-PA, as shown by the significantly decreased Glut1, Glut3, PFK-1, and LDH levels.

Conclusions: In a rat thromboembolic stroke model, both EtOH and TH used individually offer neuroprotection after the administration of rt-PA. While NBO monotherapy does not appear to be effective, it significantly potentiates the efficacy of EtOH and TH. The similar neuroprotection and underlying mechanisms pertaining to the attenuation of hyperglycolysis provided by EtOH or TH in combination with NBO suggest a possibility of substituting EtOH for TH. Thus a combination of NBO and EtOH, which are widely available and easily used, could become a novel and effective neuroprotective strategy in the clinical setting.

AB  - Abstract
The mesocorticolimbic dopamine system, originating in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is normally constrained by GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition. Accumulating evidence indicates that long-term potentiation of GABAergic synapses (LTPGABA) in VTA dopamine neurons plays an important role in the actions of drugs of abuse, including ethanol.

We previously showed that a single infusion of glycine into the VTA of rats strongly reduces ethanol intake for 24 h. In the current study, we examined the effect of glycine on the electrophysiological activities of putative dopamine VTA neurons in midbrain slices from ethanol-naïve rats. We report here that a 15-min exposure to 10 μM glycine prevented trains of high-frequency stimulation (HFS) from producing LTPGABA, which was rescued by the glycine receptor (GlyR) antagonist strychnine. Glycine also concentration-dependently decreased the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs). By contrast, glycine pretreatment did not prevent potentiation of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) during a continuous exposure to the nitric oxide (NO) donor, SNAP (S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine), or a brief exposure to 10 μM glycine and 10 μM NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate), an agonist of NMDA-type glutamate receptors. Thus, the blockade of LTPGABA by glycine is probably resulted from suppressing glutamate release by activating the GlyRs on the glutamatergic terminals. This effect of glycine may contribute to the reduction in ethanol intake induced by intra-VTA glycine observed in vivo.

AB  - Abstract
Birth weight predicts the lifetime risk for psychopathology suggesting that the quality of fetal development influences the predisposition for mental disorders. The connectivity and synaptic network of the hippocampus are implicated in depression, schizophrenia and anxiety. We thus examined the underlying molecular adaptations in the hippocampus as a function of the fetal conditions associated with low birth weight. We used tissues from the non-human primate, Macaca fascicularis, to identify changes in hippocampal gene expression early in postnatal development associated with naturally occurring low compared with normal birth weight. Microarrays were used to analyze gene expression and DNA methylation in the hippocampus of five low- and five normal-birth weight neonates. Real-time PCR was employed to validate differentially expressed genes. Birth weight associated with altered global transcription in the hippocampus. Hierarchical clustering of gene expression profiles from 24,154 probe sets grouped all samples except one by their birth weight status. Differentially expressed genes were enriched in biological processes associated with neuronal projection, positive regulation of transcription and apoptosis. About 4% of the genes with differential expression co-varied with DNA methylation levels. The data suggest that low birth weight is closely associated with hippocampal gene expression with a small epigenetic underpinning by DNA methylation in neonates. The data also provide a potential molecular basis for the developmental origin of an enhanced risk for mental disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Microglia, the resident immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS), constantly survey the surrounding neural parenchyma and promptly respond to brain injury. Activation of purinergic receptors such as P2Y12 receptors (P2Y12R) in microglia has been implicated in chemotaxis toward ATP that is released by injured neurons and astrocytes. Activation of microglial P2Y12R elicits outward potassium current that is associated with microglial chemotaxis in response to injury. This study aimed at investigating the identity of the potassium channel implicated in microglial P2Y12R-mediated chemotaxis following neuronal injury and understanding the purinergic signaling pathway coupled to the channel. Using a combination of two-photon imaging, electrophysiology and genetic tools, we found the ATP-induced outward current to be largely dependent on P2Y12R activation and mediated by G-proteins. Similarly, P2Y12R-coupled outward current was also evoked in response to laser-induced single neuron injury. This current was abolished in microglia obtained from mice lacking P2Y12R. Dissecting the properties of the P2Y12R-mediated current using a pharmacological approach revealed that both the ATP and neuronal injury-induced outward current in microglia was sensitive to quinine (1 mM) and bupivacaine (400 μM), but not tetraethylammonium (TEA) (10 mM) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) (5 mM). These results suggest that the quinine/bupivacaine-sensitive potassium channels are the functional effectors of the P2Y12R–mediated signaling in microglia activation following neuronal injury.

AB  - Abstract
Diabetes during the pregnancy period impairs hippocampal development, and is associated with neurocognitive and neurobehavioral problems in the offspring. Synaptogenesis is one of the most important events in the development of the nervous system, and is known as a mechanism by which the memory process takes place. Synaptophysin (SYP) is an integral membrane protein of synaptic vesicles in the hippocampus involved also in learning and memory. The present study aimed to examine the effects of maternal diabetes on the expression and distribution pattern of SYP, as a marker of synaptogenesis, in the developing rat hippocampus using Immunofluorescence staining and real-time PCR. Wistar female rats were maintained as diabetic from a week before pregnancy through parturition and male offspring was euthanized at postnatal day (P) 0, 7, and 14. Our results showed a significant down-regulation in mRNA expression of SYP in the offspring born to diabetic animals at P7, and P14 (P ⩽ 0.05 each). Regarding to the density of SYP expressing hippocampal neurons, we found a marked decrease in the distribution pattern of SYP in all hippocampal subfields of Streptozotocin (STZ)-D group rat neonates, especially in one and two weeks of age (P ⩽ 0.05 each). Moreover, the results revealed no significant changes in either gene expression or distribution pattern of SYP – positive neurons in insulin-treated group compared with the controls. The present study demonstrated that diabetes in pregnancy has negative impacts on synaptogenesis in the offspring’s hippocampus. Furthermore, the rigid maternal glycaemia control by insulin treatment in most cases normalized these effects.

AB  - Abstract
Prenatal exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been exploited to simulate brain disorder in animal model. Prenatal LPS-exposure has shown elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the early stages of the postnatal period. This study determines the effect of prenatal LPS-exposure on oxidative stress (OS) in the distinct brain regions in the early postnatal stages. LPS (50 μg/kg, i.p.) and water for injection (100 μl, i.p.) were given to the experimental (n = 5) and control (n = 5) group of pregnant Swiss albino mice respectively on gestational day (GD)-16 and 17. Animals were decapitated on postnatal day (PnD) – 1, 7, 14 and 21 to assay levels of oxidative markers from 6 distinct brain regions. When compared with the control, prenatal LPS-exposure alters levels of OS markers: (i) on PnD-1, glutathione (GSH) level is raised and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity is dropped, (ii) on PnD-7, advanced oxidation of protein product (AOPP) level is elevated, (iii) on PnD-14, lipid peroxidation (MDA) and activity of catalase (CAT) are enhanced, (iv) on PnD-21, increased MDA continued. The hippocampus (HC) and cerebellum (CB) were mostly susceptible to OS in the early postnatal development. Levels of MDA and activity of CAT enzyme were increased on PnD-14 in the cortex, HC and CB. Except MDA, all OS markers recovered and returned to the level of control animals on PnD-21. Taken together, these results suggest that prenatal LPS-exposure induces age- and region-specific OS in the early postnatal stage.

AB  - Abstract
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release to nerve terminals in the central nervous system is crucial in synaptic transmission and neuronal plasticity. However, BDNF release peripherally from primary afferent neurons has not been investigated. In the present study, we show that BDNF is synthesized by primary afferent neurons located in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in rat, and releases to spinal nerve terminals in response to depolarization or visceral inflammation. In two-compartmented culture that separates DRG neuronal cell bodies and spinal nerve terminals, application of 50 mM K+ to either the nerve terminal or the cell body evokes BDNF release to the terminal compartment. Inflammatory stimulation of the visceral organ (e.g. the urinary bladder) also facilitates an increase in spontaneous BDNF release from the primary afferent neurons to the axonal terminals. In the inflamed viscera, we show that BDNF immunoreactivity is increased in nerve fibers that are immuno-positive to the neuronal marker PGP9.5. Both BDNF and pro-BDNF levels are increased, however, pro-BDNF immunoreactivity is not expressed in PGP9.5-positive nerve-fiber-like structures. Determination of receptor profiles in the inflamed bladder demonstrates that BDNF high affinity receptor TrkB and general receptor p75 expression levels are elevated, with an increased level of TrkB tyrosine phosphorylation/activity. These results suggest a possibility of pro-proliferative effect in the inflamed bladder. Consistently we show that the proliferation marker Ki67 expression levels are enhanced in the inflamed organ. Our results imply that in vivo BDNF release to the peripheral organ is an important event in neurogenic inflammatory state.

AB  - Abstract
Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common heritable single gene cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). FMR1-KO mice mimic the etiology and phenotypic manifestations of FXS. Neuroanatomical changes in specific brain regions have been reported in clinical settings and in preclinical models. FMR1-KO mice have been generated in different strains including C57Bl/6 (B6) and FVB. Mice on different genetic backgrounds have stable yet distinct behavioral phenotypes that may lead to unique gene–strain interactions on brain structure. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have examined FMR1 knockout male mice on a B6 and found few differences compared to wild-type mice. Here, we examine brain volumes in FMR1 knockout male mice on a FVB background using high resolution (multi-channel 7.0 Tesla) MRI. We observe multiple differences in the neuroanatomy of male FMR1-/y mice on a FVB background. Significantly larger relative volume (% total brain volume) differences were found in major white matter structures throughout the brain. In addition, there were changes in areas associated with fronto-striatal circuitry and other regions. Functional and structural connectivity differences are often seen in human ASD, and therefore, this increased white matter seen in the FMR1-KO-FVB could be highlighting a structural over-connectivity, which could lead to some of the behavioral abnormalities seen with the FMR1-KO-FVB mice. Furthermore, these results highlight the importance of genetic strain contribution to brain structure.

AB  - Abstract
Recent experiments have shown that sexual interactions prior to cell proliferation cause an increase in neurogenesis in adult male rats. Because adult neurogenesis is critical for some forms of memory, we hypothesized that sexually induced changes in neurogenesis may be involved in mate recognition. Sexually naive adult male rats were either exposed repeatedly to the same sexual partner (familiar group) or to a series of novel sexual partners (unfamiliar group), while control males never engaged in sexual interactions. Ovariectomized female rats were induced into estrus every four days. Males were given two injections of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (200 mg/kg) to label proliferating cells, and the first sexual interactions occurred three days later. Males in the familiar and unfamiliar groups engaged in four, 30-min sexual interactions at four-day intervals, and brain tissue was collected the day after the last sexual interaction. Immunohistochemistry followed by microscopy was used to quantify BrdU-labeled cells. Sexual interactions with unfamiliar females caused a significant reduction in neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus compared to males that interacted with familiar females and compared to the control group. The familiar group showed no difference in neurogenesis compared to the control group. Males in the familiar group engaged in significantly more sexual behavior (ejaculations and intromissions) than did males in the unfamiliar group, suggesting that level of sexual activity may influence neurogenesis levels. In a second experiment, we tested whether this effect was unique to sexual interactions by replicating the entire procedure using anestrus females. We found that interactions with unfamiliar anestrus females reduced neurogenesis relative to the other groups, but this effect was not statistically significant. In combination, these results indicate that interactions with unfamiliar females reduce adult neurogenesis and the effect is stronger for sexual interactions than for social interactions.

AB  - Abstract
Cognitive and sensorimotor processes are both needed for successful planning of footsteps during complex gait situations, but the interaction between these factors during motor planning, as well as their response to dopaminergic treatment is poorly understood in Parkinson’s disease (PD). In the current study, we evaluated walking and gaze behaviors of individuals with PD while planning an approach toward an obstacle to be stepped over. The obstacle clearance task was completed both ON and OFF dopaminergic medication by individuals with Parkinson’s disease (n = 20) and compared to healthy age-matched control participants (n = 19), as well as with and without an auditory digit monitoring dual task. In this novel protocol of synchronized gaze and gait data collection, each trial was split into an early and late phase prior to the obstacle, providing a unique opportunity to examine dopamine-dependent planning deficits in PD. Interestingly, only patients in the OFF medication state showed greater deceleration in the late phase (i.e., just before the obstacle) (F(1,37) = 45.42, p &lt; 0.001), as well as an increase in step time variability (also in this late phase) with the additional demands of a dual task (F(2,74) = 3.49, p = 0.035). Only gait deceleration between approaching phases improved with dopaminergic treatment (F(1,18) = 59.20; p &lt; 0.001). Although groups showed different walking behaviors, gaze behaviors were the same for all participants, in that they planned for the obstacle more so in the early phase (p &lt; 0.05), and fixations were reduced across participants with the presence of the dual task (p &lt; 0.001). Surprisingly, the gaze behavior of the PD OFF group showed no interactions with phase or condition suggesting that the deceleration and increased variability when approaching an obstacle is the result of a greater demand for online sensory feedback that cannot be compensated for with visual strategies. We conclude that dopamine influences planning by limiting sensorimotor processing capacity, especially in the presence of increased cognitive demand in PD.

AB  - Abstract
The ability to adjust movement timing is essential in daily life. Explorations of the underlying neural mechanisms have reported a gradual increase or decrease in neuronal activity prior to self-timed movements within the cortico-basal ganglia loop. Previous studies in both humans and animals have shown that endogenous dopamine (DA) plays a modulatory role in self-timing. However, the specific site of dopaminergic regulation remains elusive because the systemic application of DA-related substances can directly alter both cortical and subcortical neuronal activities. To investigate the role of striatal DA in self-timing, we locally injected DA receptor agonists or antagonists into the striatum of two female monkeys (Macaca fuscata) while they performed two versions of the memory-guided saccade (MS) task. In the conventional, triggered MS task, animals made a saccade to the location of a previously flashed visual cue in response to the fixation point offset. In the self-timed MS task, monkeys were rewarded for making a self-initiated saccade within a predetermined time interval following the cue. Infusion of a small amount of a D1 or D2 antagonist led to early saccades in the self-timed, but not the triggered MS tasks, while infusion of DA agonists produced no consistent effect. We also found that local administration of nicotinic but not muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonists and antagonists altered the timing of self-initiated saccades. Our data suggest that the timing of self-initiated movements may be regulated by the balance of signals in the direct and indirect basal ganglia pathways, as well as that between both hemispheres of the brain.

AB  - Abstract
Structural plasticity of dendritic spines, which underlies higher brain functions including learning and memory, is dynamically regulated by the actin cytoskeleton and its associated proteins. Drebrin A is an F-actin-binding protein preferentially expressed in the brain and localized in the dendritic spines of mature neurons. Isoform conversion from drebrin E to drebrin A and accumulation of the latter in dendritic spines occurs during synapse maturation. We have previously demonstrated that drebrin A plays a pivotal role in spine morphogenesis and plasticity. However, it is unclear whether drebrin A plays a specific role in processes required for structural plasticity, and whether drebrin E can substitute in this role. To answer these questions, we analyzed mutant mice (named DAKO mice), in which isoform conversion from drebrin E to drebrin A is disrupted. In DAKO mouse brain, drebrin E continues to be expressed throughout life instead of drebrin A. Electrophysiological studies using hippocampal slices revealed that long-term potentiation of CA1 synapses was impaired in adult DAKO mice, but not in adolescents. In parallel with this age-dependent impairment, DAKO mice exhibited impaired hippocampus-dependent fear learning in an age-dependent manner; the impairment was evident in adult mice, but not in adolescents. In addition, histological investigation revealed that the spine length of the apical dendrite of CA1 pyramidal cells was significantly longer in adult DAKO mice than in wild-type mice. Our data indicate that the roles of drebrin E and drebrin A in brain function are different from each other, that the isoform conversion of drebrin is critical, and that drebrin A is indispensable for normal synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent fear memory in the adult brain.

Extracts of Asparagus cochinchinensis (AC) have antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and immunostimulant effects. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying the effects of AC have not been sufficiently explored. Thus we performed in vivo and in vitro experiments to further characterize potential therapeutic effects and to clarify the underlying mechanisms.

In the tail suspension test immobility time was significantly reduced after administration of AC which suggests antidepressant-like activity without effect on body core temperature. Moreover, in animals pretreated with AC infarct size after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery was reduced. In vitro experiments confirmed neuroprotective effects. Total saponin obtained from AC significantly inhibited H2O2-induced cell death in cultured cortical neurons. The survival-promoting effect by AC saponins was partially blocked by inhibitors for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ErK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase Akt (PI3K/Akt) cascades, both of which are known as survival-promoting signaling molecules. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Scr homology-2 (SH2) domain-containing phosphatase 2 (Shp-2) was induced by AC, and the protective effect of AC was abolished by NSC87877, an inhibitor for Shp-2, suggesting an involvement of Shp-2 mediated intracellular signaling in AC saponins. Moreover, AC-induced activation of pShp-2 and ErK1/2 were blocked by NSC87877 indicating that activation of these signaling pathways was mediated by the Shp-2 signaling pathway.

These effects appear to be associated with activation of the Shp-2, ErK1/2 and Akt signaling pathways. Our results suggest that AC has antidepressant-like and neuroprotective (reducing infarct size) effects and that activation of pShp-2 and pErK1/2 pathways may be involved in the effects.

AB  - Abstract
Prothymosin alpha (ProTα) has robustness roles against brain and retinal ischemia or serum-starvation stress. In the ProTα sequence, the active core 30-amino acid peptide/P30 (a.a.49–78) is necessary for the original neuroprotective actions against ischemia. Moreover, the 9-amino acid peptide sequence/P9 (a.a.52–60) in P30 still shows neuroprotective activity against brain and retinal ischemia, though P9 is less potent than P30. As the previous structure–activity relationship study for ProTα may not be enough, the possibility still exists that any sequence smaller than P9 retains potent neuroprotective activity. When different P9- and P30-related peptides were intravitreally injected 24 h after retinal ischemia in mice, the 6-amino acid peptide/P6 (NEVDEE, a.a.51–56) showed potent protective effects against ischemia-induced retinal functional deficits, which are equipotent to the level of P30 peptide in electroretinography (ERG) and histological damage in Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining. Further studies using ERG and HE staining suggested that intravitreal or intravenous (i.v.) injection with modified P6 peptide/P6Q (NEVDQE) potently inhibited retinal ischemia-induced functional and histological damage. In an immunohistochemical analysis, the ischemia-induced loss of retinal ganglion, bipolar, amacrine and photoreceptor cells were inhibited by a systemic administration with P6Q peptide 24 h after the ischemic stress. In addition, systemic post-treatment with P6Q peptide significantly inhibited retinal ischemia-induced microglia and astrocyte activation in terms of increased ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) intensity, respectively, as well as their morphological changes, increased number and migration. Thus, this study demonstrates the therapeutic significance of modified P6 peptide P6Q (NEVDQE) derived from 6-amino acid peptide (P6) in ProTα against ischemic damage.

AB  - Abstract
In the spinal dorsal horn (DH), nerve injury activates microglia and induces neuropathic pain. Several studies clarified an involvement of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the microglial activation. However, the origin of ATP together with the release mechanism is unclear. Recent in vitro study revealed that an ATP marker, quinacrine, in lysosomes was released from neurite terminal of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons to extracellular space via lysosomal exocytosis. Here, we demonstrate a possibility that the lysosomal ingredient including ATP released from DRG neurons by lysosomal-exocytosis is an additional source of the glial activation in DH after nerve injury. After rat L5 spinal nerve ligation (SNL), mRNA for transcription factor EB (TFEB), a transcription factor controlling lysosomal activation and exocytosis, was induced in the DRG. Simultaneously both lysosomal protein, LAMP1- and vesicular nuclear transporter (VNUT)-positive vesicles were increased in L5 DRG neurons and ipsilateral DH. The quinacrine staining in DH was increased and co-localized with LAMP1 immunoreactivity after nerve injury. In DH, LAMP1-positive vesicles were also co-localized with a peripheral nerve marker, Isolectin B4 (IB4) lectin. Injection of the adenovirus encoding mCherry-LAMP1 into DRG showed that mCherry-positive lysosomes are transported to the central nerve terminal in DH. These findings suggest that activation of lysosome synthesis including ATP packaging in DRG, the central transportation of the lysosome, and subsequent its exocytosis from the central nerve terminal of DRG neurons in response to nerve injury could be a partial mechanism for activation of microglia in DH. This lysosome-mediated microglia activation mechanism may provide another clue to control nociception and pain.

AB  - Abstract
A plethora of studies have indicated that enriched environment (EE) paradigm provokes plastic and morphological changes in astrocytes with accompanying increments of their density and positively affects the behavior of rodents. We also previously documented that EE could be employed to preclude several behavioral abnormalities, mainly cognitive deficits, attributed to postnatal N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist (MK-801) treatment, as a rodent model of schizophrenia (SCH) aspects. Given this, the current study quantitatively investigated the number of cells, presumed to be astrocytes, expressing two astroglia-associated proteins (S100B and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)) by immunohistochemistry in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), along with anxiety and passive avoidance (PA) learning behaviors by utilizing elevated plus maze (EPM) and shuttle-box tests, in MK-801-treated male wistar rats submitted to EE and non-EE rats. Following a treatment regime of sub-chronic MK-801 (1.0 mg/kg i.p. daily for five consecutive days from postnatal day (P) 6), S-100B-positive cells and anxiety level were markedly increased, while the GFAP-positive cells and PA learning were notably attenuated. The trend of diminished GFAP-immunopositive cells and elevated S100B-immunostained cells in the PFC was reversed in the SCH-like rats by exposure of animals to EE, commencing from birth up to the time of experiments on P28–85. Additionally, EE exhibited an ameliorating effect on the behavioral abnormalities evoked by MK-801. Overall, present findings support that improper astrocyte functioning and behavioral changes, reminiscent of the many facets of SCH, occur consequential to repetitive administration of MK-801 and that raising rat pups in an EE mitigates these alterations.

AB  - Abstract
Dystroglycan (DG) is widely expressed in various tissues, and throughout the cerebral microvasculature. It consists of two subunits, α-DG and β-DG, and the cleavage of the latter by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 underlies a number of physiological and pathological processes. However, the involvement of MMP-2/-9-mediated β-DG cleavage in cerebral ischemia remains uncertain. In astrocytes, DG is crucial for maintaining the polarization of aquaporin-4 (AQP4), which plays a role in the regulation of cytotoxic and vasogenic edema. The present study aimed to explore the effects of MMP-2/-9-mediated β-DG cleavage on AQP4 polarization and brain edema in acute cerebral ischemia. A model of cerebral ischemia was established via permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) in male C57BL/6 mice. Western blotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemical staining, immunofluorescent staining, electron microscopy, and light microscopy were used. Captopril was applied as a selective MMP-2/-9 inhibitor. Recombinant mouse MMP (rmMMP)-2 and -9 were used in an in vitro cleavage experiment. The present study demonstrated evidence of β-DG cleavage by MMP-2/-9 in pMCAO mouse brains; this cleavage was implicated in AQP4 redistribution and brain edema in cerebral ischemia. In addition, captopril exacerbated cytotoxic edema and ameliorated vasogenic edema at 24 h after pMCAO, and alleviated brain edema and neurological deficit at 48 h and 72 h. In conclusion, this study provides novel insight into the effects of MMP-2/-9-mediated β-DG cleavage in acute cerebral ischemia. Such findings might facilitate the development of a therapeutic strategy for the optimization of MMP-2/-9 targeted treatment in cerebral ischemia.

AB  - Abstract
It is known that adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) is released along with the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) from motor nerve terminals. At mammalian neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), we have previously demonstrated that ATP is able to decrease ACh secretion by activation of P2Y receptors coupled to pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/o protein. In this group, the receptor subtypes activated by adenine nucleotides are P2Y12 and P2Y13. Here, we investigated, by means of pharmacological and immunohistochemical assays, the P2Y receptor subtype that mediates the modulation of spontaneous and evoked ACh release in mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations. First, we confirmed that the preferential agonist for P2Y12–13 receptors, 2-methylthioadenosine 5′-diphosphate trisodium salt hydrate (2-MeSADP), reduced MEPP frequency without affecting MEPP amplitude as well as the amplitude and quantal content of end-plate potentials (EPPs). The effect on spontaneous secretion disappeared after the application of the selective P2Y12–13 antagonists AR-C69931MX or 2-methylthioadenosine 5′-monophosphate triethylammonium salt hydrate (2-MeSAMP). 2-MeSADP was more potent than ADP and ATP in reducing MEPP frequency. Then we demonstrated that the selective P2Y13 antagonist MRS-2211 completely prevented the inhibitory effect of 2-MeSADP on MEPP frequency and EPP amplitude, whereas the P2Y12 antagonist MRS-2395 failed to do this. The preferential agonist for P2Y13 receptors inosine 5′-diphosphate sodium salt (IDP) reduced spontaneous and evoked ACh secretion and MRS-2211 abolished IDP-mediated modulation. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed the presence of P2Y13 but not P2Y12 receptors at the end-plate region. Disappearance of P2Y13 receptors after denervation suggests the presynaptic localization of the receptors. We conclude that, at motor nerve terminals, the Gi/o protein-coupled P2Y receptors implicated in presynaptic inhibition of spontaneous and evoked ACh release are of the subtype P2Y13. This study provides new insights into the types of purinergic receptors that contribute to the fine-tuning of cholinergic transmission at mammalian neuromuscular junction.

AB  - Abstract
It has been suggested that synapse-associated protein of 97-kDa molecular weight (SAP97) is a susceptibility factor for childhood and adult neuropsychiatric disorders. SAP97 is a scaffolding protein that shares direct and indirect binding partners with the Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) gene product, a gene with strong association with neuropsychiatric disorders. Here we investigated the possibility that these two proteins converge upon a common molecular pathway. Since DISC1 modifies Wnt/β-catenin signaling via changes in glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) phosphorylation, we asked if SAP97 impacts Wnt/β-catenin signaling and GSK3β phosphorylation. We find that SAP97 acts as inhibitor of Wnt signaling activity and can suppress the stimulatory effects of DISC1 on β-catenin transcriptional activity. Reductions in SAP97 abundance also decrease GSK3β phosphorylation. In addition, we find that over expression of DISC1 leads to an increase in the abundance of SAP97, by inhibiting its proteasomal degradation. Our findings suggest that SAP97 and DISC1 contribute to maintaining Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity within a homeostatic range by regulating GSK3β phosphorylation.

AB  - Abstract
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a well-known pain mediator abundantly produced in injured tissues, sensitizes nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons (nociceptors) through its four EP receptors (EP1–4). Our prior study showed that PGE2 or EP4 agonist stimulates EP4 externalization and this event was not only suppressed by the inhibitor of anterograde export, but also by the recycling inhibitor (St-Jacques and Ma, 2013). These data suggest that EP4 recycling also contributes to agonist-enhanced EP4 surface abundance. In the current study, we tested this hypothesis using antibody-feeding-based internalization assay, recycling assay and FITC-PGE2 binding assay. We observed that selective EP4 agonist 1-hydroxy-PGE1 (1-OH-PGE1) or CAY10850 time- and concentration-dependently increased EP4 internalization in cultured DRG neuron. Internalized EP4 was predominantly localized in the early endosomes and recycling endosomes, but rarely in the late endosomes and lysosomes. These observations were confirmed by FITC-PGE2 binding assay. We further revealed that 1-OH-PGE1 or CAY10850 time- and concentration-dependently increased EP4 recycling. Double exposures to 1-OH-PGE1 induced a greater increase in calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) release than a single exposure or vehicle exposure, an event blocked by pre-treatment with the recycling inhibitor monensin. Our data suggest that EP4 recycling contributes to agonist-induced cell surface abundance and consequently enhanced receptor sensitivity. Facilitating EP4 externalization and recycling is a novel mechanism underlying PGE2-induced nociceptor sensitization.

AB  - Abstract
Increased glutamatergic neurotransmission appears to mediate the reinforcing properties of drugs of abuse, including ethanol (EtOH). We have shown that administration of ceftriaxone (CEF), a β-lactam antibiotic, reduced EtOH intake and increased glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) expression in mesocorticolimbic regions of male and female alcohol-preferring (P) rats. In the present study, we tested whether CEF administration would reduce nicotine (NIC) and/or EtOH intake by adult female P rats. P rats were randomly assigned to 4 groups: (a) 5% sucrose (SUC) or 10% SUC [SUC], (b) 5% SUC + 0.07 mg/ml NIC and 10% SUC + 0.14 mg/ml NIC [NIC–SUC], 15% EtOH and 30% EtOH [EtOH] and (d) 15% EtOH + 0.07 mg/ml NIC and 30% EtOH + 0.14 mg/ml NIC [NIC–EtOH]. After achieving stable intakes (4 weeks), the rats were administered 7 consecutive, daily i.p. injections of either saline or 200 mg/kg CEF. The effects of CEF on intake were significant but differed across the reinforcers; such that ml/kg/day SUC was reduced by ∼30%, mg/kg/day NIC was reduced by ∼70% in the NIC–SUC group and ∼40% in the EtOH–NIC group, whereas g/kg/day EtOH was reduced by ∼40% in both the EtOH and EtOH–NIC group. The effects of CEF on GLT-1 expression were also studied. We found that CEF significantly increased GLT-1 expression in the prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens of the NIC and NIC–EtOH rats as compared to NIC and NIC–EtOH saline-treated rats. These findings provide further support for GLT-1-associated mechanisms in EtOH and/or NIC abuse. The present results along with previous reports of CEF’s efficacy in reducing cocaine self-administration in rats suggest that modulation of GLT-1 expression and/or activity is an important pharmacological target for treating polysubstance abuse and dependence.

AB  - Abstract
Neuronal activity associated with visual processing of an unfamiliar face gradually diminishes when it is viewed repeatedly. This process, known as repetition suppression (RS), is involved in the acquisition of familiarity. Current models suggest that RS results from interactions between visual information processing areas located in the occipito-temporal cortex and higher order areas, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Brain signal complexity, which reflects information dynamics of cortical networks, has been shown to increase as unfamiliar faces become familiar. However, the complementarity of RS and increases in brain signal complexity have yet to be demonstrated within the same measurements. We hypothesized that RS and brain signal complexity increase occur simultaneously during learning of unfamiliar faces. Further, we expected alteration of DLPFC function by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to modulate RS and brain signal complexity over the occipito-temporal cortex. Participants underwent three tDCS conditions in random order: right anodal/left cathodal, right cathodal/left anodal and sham. Following tDCS, participants learned unfamiliar faces, while an electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Results revealed RS over occipito-temporal electrode sites during learning, reflected by a decrease in signal energy, a measure of amplitude. Simultaneously, as signal energy decreased, brain signal complexity, as estimated with multiscale entropy (MSE), increased. In addition, prefrontal tDCS modulated brain signal complexity over the right occipito-temporal cortex during the first presentation of faces. These results suggest that although RS may reflect a brain mechanism essential to learning, complementary processes reflected by increases in brain signal complexity, may be instrumental in the acquisition of novel visual information. Such processes likely involve long-range coordinated activity between prefrontal and lower order visual areas.

AB  - Abstract
Emerging studies have shown that pharmacological activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) produces potent analgesic effects in different animal pain models. Currently, the spinal molecular and synaptic mechanism by which AMPK regulates the pain signaling system remains unclear. To address this issue, we utilized the Cre-LoxP system to conditionally knockout the AMPKα1 gene in the nervous system of mice. We demonstrated that AMPKα1 is imperative for maintaining normal nociception, and mice deficient for AMPKα1 exhibit mechanical allodynia. This is concomitantly associated with increased glutamatergic synaptic activities in neurons located in the superficial spinal dorsal horn, which results from the increased glutamate release from presynaptic terminals and function of ligand-gated glutamate receptors at the postsynaptic neurons. Additionally, AMPKα1 knockout mice have increased activities of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38), as well as elevated levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) in the spinal dorsal horn. Systemic administration of a non-specific ROS scavenger (phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone, PBN) or a HO-1 activator (Cobalt protoporphyrin IX, CoPP) attenuated allodynia in AMPKα1 knockout mice. Bath-perfusion of the ROS scavenger or HO-1 activator effectively attenuated the increased ROS levels and glutamatergic synaptic activities in the spinal dorsal horn. Our findings suggest that ROS are the key down-stream signaling molecules mediating the behavioral hypersensitivity in AMPKα1 knockout mice. Thus, targeting AMPKα1 may represent an effective approach for the treatment of pathological pain conditions associated with neuroinflammation at the spinal dorsal horn.

AB  - Abstract
Neurons within the vagal motoneuron region of the lamprey have been shown to modulate respiratory activity via ascending excitatory projections to the paratrigeminal respiratory group (pTRG), the proposed respiratory rhythm generator. The present study was performed on in vitro brainstem preparations of the lamprey to provide a characterization of ascending projections within the whole respiratory motoneuron column with regard to the distribution of neurons projecting to the pTRG and related neurochemical markers. Injections of Neurobiotin were performed into the pTRG and the presence of glutamate, GABA and glycine immunoreactivity was investigated by double-labeling experiments. Interestingly, retrogradely labeled neurons were found not only in the vagal region, but also in the facial and glossopharyngeal motoneuron regions. They were also present within the sensory octavolateral area (OLA). The results show for the first time that neurons projecting to the pTRG are immunoreactive for glutamate, surrounded by GABA-immunoreactive structures and associated with the presence of glycinergic cells. Consistently, GABAA or glycine receptor blockade within the investigated regions increased the respiratory frequency. Furthermore, microinjections of agonists and antagonists of ionotropic glutamate receptors and of the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol showed that OLA neurons do not contribute to respiratory rhythm generation. The results provide evidence that glutamatergic ascending pathways to the pTRG are subject to a potent inhibitory control and suggest that disinhibition is one important mechanism subserving their function. The general characteristics of inhibitory control involved in rhythmic activities, such as respiration, appear to be highly conserved throughout vertebrate evolution.

AB  - Abstract
The dorsal horn (DH) of the spinal cord contains a heterogenous population of neurons that process incoming sensory signals before information ascends to the brain. We have recently characterized calretinin-expressing (CR+) neurons in the DH and shown that they can be divided into excitatory and inhibitory subpopulations. The excitatory population receives high-frequency excitatory synaptic input and expresses delayed firing action potential discharge, whereas the inhibitory population receives weak excitatory drive and exhibits tonic or initial bursting discharge. Here, we characterize inhibitory synaptic input and neuromodulation in the two CR+ populations, in order to determine how each is regulated. We show that excitatory CR+ neurons receive mixed inhibition from GABAergic and glycinergic sources, whereas inhibitory CR+ neurons receive inhibition, which is dominated by glycine. Noradrenaline and serotonin produced robust outward currents in excitatory CR+ neurons, predicting an inhibitory action on these neurons, but neither neuromodulator produced a response in CR+ inhibitory neurons. In contrast, enkephalin (along with selective mu and delta opioid receptor agonists) produced outward currents in inhibitory CR+ neurons, consistent with an inhibitory action but did not affect the excitatory CR+ population. Our findings show that the pharmacology of inhibitory inputs and neuromodulator actions on CR+ cells, along with their excitatory inputs can define these two subpopulations further, and this could be exploited to modulate discrete aspects of sensory processing selectively in the DH.

AB  - Abstract
It is well known that corticomotor excitability is altered during the post-exercise depression following fatigue within the primary motor cortex (M1). However, it is currently unknown whether corticomotor reorganization following muscle fatigue differs between magnitudes of force and whether corticomotor reorganization occurs measured with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Fifteen young healthy adults (age 23.8 ± 1.4, 8 females) participated in a within-subjects, repeated measures design study, where they underwent three testing sessions separated by one-week each. Subjects performed separate sessions of each: low-force isometric contraction (30% maximal voluntary contraction [MVC]), high-force isometric contraction (95% MVC) of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle until self-perceived exhaustion, as well as one session of a 30-min rest as a control. We examined changes in corticomotor map area, excitability and location of the FDI representation in and around M1 using TMS. The main finding was that following low-force, but not high-force fatigue (HFF) corticomotor map area and excitability reduced [by 3 cm2 (t(14) = −2.94, p = 0.01) and 56% respectively t(14) = −4.01, p &lt; 0.001)]. Additionally, the region of corticomotor excitability shifted posteriorly (6.4 ± 2.5 mm) (t(14) = −6.33, p = .019). Corticomotor output became less excitable particularly in regions adjoining M1. Overall, post-exercise depression is present in low-force, but not for HFF. Further, low-force fatigue (LFF) results in a posterior shift in corticomotor output. These changes may be indicative of increased sensory feedback from the somatosensory cortex during the recovery phase of fatigue.

AB  - Abstract
This study aims to understand how dopamine and the neuromodulators, adenosine and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) modulate neuromuscular transmission. Adenosine and ATP are well-recognized for their regulatory effects on dopamine in the central nervous system. However, if similar interactions occur at the neuromuscular junction is unknown. We hypothesize that the activation of adenosine A1/A2A and/or P2 purinoceptors may influence the action of dopamine on neuromuscular transmission. Using the rat phrenic nerve hemi-diaphragm, we assessed the influence of dopamine, adenosine and ATP on the height of nerve-evoked muscle twitches. We investigated how the selective blockade of adenosine A1 receptors (2.5 nM DPCPX), adenosine A2A receptors (50 nM CSC) and P2 purinoceptors (100 μM suramin) modified the effects of dopamine. Dopamine alone increased indirect muscle contractions while adenosine and ATP either enhanced or depressed nerve-evoked muscle twitches in a concentration-dependent manner. The facilitatory effects of 256 μM dopamine were significantly reduced to 29.62 ± 2.79% or 53.69 ± 5.45% in the presence of DPCPX or CSC, respectively, relative to 70.03 ± 1.57% with dopamine alone. Alternatively, the action of 256 μM dopamine was potentiated from 70.03 ± 1.57, in the absence of suramin, to 86.83 ± 4.36%, in the presence of suramin. It can be concluded that the activation of adenosine A1 and A2A receptors and P2 purinoceptors potentially play a central role in the regulation of dopamine effects at the neuromuscular junction. Clinically this study offers new insights for the indirect manipulation of neuromuscular transmission for the treatment of disorders characterized by motor dysfunction.

AB  - Abstract
Cognitive impairment, anxiety- and depressive-like symptoms are well recognized outcome of cerebral ischemia in clinical and preclinical settings. Rolipram, a phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitor, improves cognition and produces anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects in rodents. Rolipram also exerts anti-inflammatory effects and enhances survival of newborn hippocampal neurons in mice subjected to transient global cerebral ischemia. Here, we evaluated the effects of chronic rolipram treatment in mice subjected to transient global brain ischemia. C56B6/7 mice were subjected to bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) and were then tested in a multi-tiered behavioral battery including the elevated zero maze (EZM), open field (OF), object location test (OLT), and forced swim test (FST). We also investigated the effects of rolipram on hippocampal neurodegeneration and the expression of the neuronal plasticity markers doublecortin (DCX) and microtubule-associated protein (MAP-2). Ischemic mice exhibited memory deficits OLT, higher levels of anxiety EZM and behavioral despair FST. BCCAO caused neuronal loss in the CA3 hippocampal subfield and basolateral amygdala (BLA). In the hippocampus of BCCAO mice, a disrupted neuronal plasticity was evidenced by decreased DCX expression. Chronic treatment with rolipram attenuated the behavioral effects of BCCAO. Rolipram also decreased neurodegeneration in the CA3 while it increased dendritic arborization of DCX-immunoreactive (DCX-IR) neurons and microtubule associate MAP-2 expression in the hippocampus of BCCAO mice. These data suggest that chronic inhibition of PDE-4 can be a useful therapeutic strategy to improve the emotional and cognitive outcomes of transient global cerebral ischemia.

AB  - Abstract
A significant contributor to the obesity epidemic is the overconsumption of highly palatable, energy dense foods. Chronic intake of palatable foods is associated with neuroadaptations within the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system adaptations which may lead to behavioral changes, such as overconsumption or bingeing. We examined behavioral and molecular outcomes in mice that were given chronic exposure to a high-fat diet (HFD; 12 weeks), with the onset of the diet either in adolescence or adulthood. To examine whether observed effects could be reversed upon removal of the HFD, animals were also studied 4 weeks after a return to chow feeding. Most notably, female mice, particularly those exposed to HFD starting in adolescence, demonstrated the emergence of binge-like behavior when given restricted access to a palatable food. Further, changes in dopamine-related gene expression and dopamine content in the prefrontal cortex were observed. Some of these HFD-driven phenotypes reversed upon removal of the diet, whereas others were initiated by removal of the diet. These findings have implications for obesity management and interventions, as both pharmacological and behavioral therapies are often combined with dietary interventions (e.g., reduction in calorie dense foods).

AB  - Abstract
The basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) modulate anxiety and social behaviors. It remains to be elucidated, however, whether direct projections from the BLA to the mPFC play a functional role in these behaviors. We used optogenetic approaches in behaving mice to either activate or inhibit BLA inputs to the mPFC during behavioral assays that assess anxiety-like behavior and social interaction. Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-mediated activation of BLA inputs to the mPFC produced anxiogenic effects in the elevated plus maze and open field test, whereas halorhodopsin (NpHR)-mediated inhibition produced anxiolytic effects. Furthermore, activation of the BLA-mPFC pathway reduced social interaction in the resident-intruder test, whereas inhibition facilitated social interaction. These results establish a causal relationship between activity in the BLA-mPFC pathway and the bidirectional modulation of anxiety-related and social behaviors.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) present unique challenges in the fields of genetics and neurobiology because of the clinical and molecular heterogeneity underlying these disorders. Genetic mutations found in ASD patients provide opportunities to dissect the molecular and circuit mechanisms underlying autistic behaviors using animal models. Ongoing studies of genetically modified models have offered critical insight into possible common mechanisms arising from different mutations, but links between molecular abnormalities and behavioral phenotypes remain elusive. The challenges encountered in modeling autism in mice demand a new analytic paradigm that integrates behavioral assessment with circuit-level analysis in genetically modified models with strong construct validity.

AB  - Abstract
Major depressive disorder (MDD) will affect one out of every five people in their lifetime and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Nevertheless, mechanisms associated with the pathogenesis of MDD have yet to be completely understood and current treatments remain ineffective in a large subset of patients. In this review, we summarize the most recent discoveries and insights for which parallel findings have been obtained in human depressed subjects and rodent models of mood disorders in order to examine the potential etiology of depression. These mechanisms range from synaptic plasticity mechanisms to epigenetics and the immune system where there is strong evidence to support a functional role in the development of specific depression symptomology. Ultimately we conclude by discussing how novel therapeutic strategies targeting central and peripheral processes might ultimately aid in the development of effective new treatments for MDD and related stress disorders.

Animal models of mental disorders should ideally have construct, face, and predictive validity, but current animal models do not always satisfy these validity criteria. Additionally, animal models of depression rely mainly on stress-induced behavioral changes. These stress-induced models have limited validity, because stress is not a risk factor specific to depression, and the models do not recapitulate the recurrent and spontaneous nature of depressive episodes. Although animal models exhibiting recurrent depressive episodes or bipolar depression have not yet been established, several researchers are trying to generate such animals by modeling clinical risk factors as well as by manipulating a specific neural circuit using emerging techniques.

AB  - Abstract
Current evidence suggests that anxiety disorders have developmental origins. Early insults to the circuits that sub-serve emotional regulation are thought to cause disease later in life. Evidence from studies in mice demonstrate that the serotonergic system in general, and serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptors in particular, are critical during the early postnatal period for the normal development of circuits that subserve anxious behavior. However, little is known about the role of serotonin signaling through 5-HT1A receptors between the emergence of normal anxiety behavior after weaning, and the mature adult phenotype. Here, we use both transgenic and pharmacological approaches in male mice, to identify a sensitive period for 5-HT1A function in the stabilization of circuits mediating anxious behavior during adolescence. Using a transgenic approach we show that suppression of 5-HT1A receptor expression beginning in early adolescence results in an anxiety-like phenotype in the open field test. We further demonstrate that treatment with the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100,635 between postnatal day (P)35 and P50, but not at later timepoints, results in altered anxiety in ethologically based conflict tests like the open field test and elevated plus maze. This change in anxiety behavior occurs without impacting behavior in the more depression-related sucrose preference test or forced swim test. The treatment with WAY 100,635 does not affect adult 5-HT1A expression levels, but leads to increased expression of the serotonin transporter in the raphe, along with enhanced serotonin levels in both the prefrontal cortex and raphe that correlate with the behavioral changes observed in adult mice. This work demonstrates that signaling through 5-HT1A receptors during adolescence (a time when pathological anxiety emerges), but not early adulthood, is critical in regulating anxiety setpoints. These data suggest the possibility that brief interventions in the serotonergic system during adolescence could lead to profound and enduring changes in physiology and behavior.

AB  - Abstract
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly debilitating and prevalent psychological disorder. It is characterized by highly distressing intrusive trauma memories that are partly explained by fear conditioning. Despite efficient therapeutic approaches, a subset of PTSD patients displays spontaneous recurrence of traumatic memories after successful treatment. The development of animal behavioral models mimicking the individual variability in treatment outcome for PTSD patients represent therefore an important challenge as it allows for the identification of predicting factors of resilience or susceptibility to relapse. However, to date, only few animal behavioral models of long-lasting fear recovery have been developed and their predictive validity has not been tested directly. The objectives of this study were twofold. First we aimed to develop a simple animal behavioral model of long-lasting fear recovery based on auditory cued fear conditioning and extinction learning, which recapitulates the heterogeneity of fear responses observed in PTSD patients after successful treatment. Second we aimed at testing the predictive validity of our behavioral model and used to this purpose a translational approach based (i) on the demonstration of the efficiency of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy to reduce conditioned fear responses in PTSD patients and (ii) on the implementation in our behavioral model of an electrical bilateral alternating stimulation of the eyelid which mimics the core feature of EMDR. Our data indicate that electrical bilateral alternating stimulation of the eyelid during extinction learning alleviates long-lasting fear recovery of conditioned fear responses and dramatically reduces inter-individual variability. These results demonstrate the face and predictive validity of our animal behavioral model and provide an interesting tool to understand the neurobiological underpinnings of long-lasting fear recovery.

Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a disorder characterized by positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions), negative symptoms (blunted affect, alogia, reduced sociability, and anhedonia), as well as persistent cognitive deficits (memory, concentration, and learning). While the biology underlying subjective experiences is difficult to study, abnormalities in electroencephalographic (EEG) measures offer a means to dissect potential circuit and cellular changes in brain function. EEG is indispensable for studying cerebral information processing due to the introduction of techniques for the decomposition of event-related activity into its frequency components. Specifically, brain activity in the gamma frequency range (30–80 Hz) is thought to underlie cognitive function and may be used as an endophenotype to aid in diagnosis and treatment of SCZ. In this review we address evidence indicating that there is increased resting-state gamma power in SCZ. We address how modeling this aspect of the illness in animals may help treatment development as well as providing insights into the etiology of SCZ.

AB  - Abstract
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a severe, chronic, and highly prevalent psychiatric disorder that affects between 1.5% and 3% of people worldwide. Despite its severity, high prevalence, and clear societal cost, current OCD therapies are only partially effective. In order to ultimately develop improved treatments for this severe mental illness, we need further research to gain an improved understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies obsessions and compulsions. Though studies in OCD patients can provide some insight into the disease process, studies in humans are inherently limited in their ability to dissect pathologic processes because of their non-invasive nature. The recent development of strategies for genetic and circuit-specific manipulation in rodent models finally allows us to identify the molecular, cellular, and circuit events that lead to abnormal repetitive behaviors and affect dysregulation relevant to OCD. This review will highlight recent studies in mouse model systems that have used transgenic and optogenetic tools in combination with classic pharmacology and behavioral techniques to advance our understanding of these pathologic processes.

AB  - Abstract
Bipolar disorder (BD) is the sixth leading cause of disability in the world according to the World Health Organization and affects nearly six million (∼2.5% of the population) adults in the United State alone each year. BD is primarily characterized by mood cycling of depressive (e.g., helplessness, reduced energy and activity, and anhedonia) and manic (e.g., increased energy and hyperactivity, reduced need for sleep, impulsivity, reduced anxiety and depression), episodes. The following review describes several animal models of bipolar mania with a focus on more recent findings using genetically modified mice, including several with the potential of investigating the mechanisms underlying ‘mood’ cycling (or behavioral switching in rodents). We discuss whether each of these models satisfy criteria of validity (i.e., face, predictive, and construct), while highlighting their strengths and limitations. Animal models are helping to address critical questions related to pathophysiology of bipolar mania, in an effort to more clearly define necessary targets of first-line medications, lithium and valproic acid, and to discover novel mechanisms with the hope of developing more effective therapeutics. Future studies will leverage new technologies and strategies for integrating animal and human data to reveal important insights into the etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of BD.

AB  - Abstract
Parvalbumin (PVALB)-expressing fast-spiking interneurons subserve important roles in many brain regions by modulating circuit function and dysfunction of these neurons is strongly implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and autism. To facilitate the study of PVALB neuron function we need to be able to identify PVALB neurons in vivo. We have generated a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mouse line expressing the red fluorophore tdTomato under the control of endogenous regulatory elements of the Pvalb gene locus (JAX # 027395). We show that the tdTomato transgene is faithfully expressed relative to endogenous PVALB expression throughout the brain. Furthermore, targeted patch clamp recordings confirm that the labeled populations in neocortex, striatum, and hippocampus are fast-spiking interneurons based on intrinsic properties. This new transgenic mouse line provides a useful tool to study PVALB neuron function in the normal brain as well as in mouse models of psychiatric disease.

AB  - Abstract
Elevated whole blood serotonin, or hyperserotonemia, was the first biomarker identified in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and is present in more than 25% of affected children. The serotonin system is a logical candidate for involvement in ASD due to its pleiotropic role across multiple brain systems both dynamically and across development. Tantalizing clues connect this peripheral biomarker with changes in brain and behavior in ASD, but the contribution of the serotonin system to ASD pathophysiology remains incompletely understood. Studies of whole blood serotonin levels in ASD and in a large founder population indicate greater heritability than for the disorder itself and suggest an association with recurrence risk. Emerging data from both neuroimaging and postmortem samples also indicate changes in the brain serotonin system in ASD. Genetic linkage and association studies of both whole blood serotonin levels and of ASD risk point to the chromosomal region containing the serotonin transporter (SERT) gene in males but not in females. In ASD families with evidence of linkage to this region, multiple rare SERT amino acid variants lead to a convergent increase in serotonin uptake in cell models. A knock-in mouse model of one of these variants, SERT Gly56Ala, recapitulates the hyperserotonemia biomarker and shows increased brain serotonin clearance, increased serotonin receptor sensitivity, and altered social, communication, and repetitive behaviors. Data from other rodent models also suggest an important role for the serotonin system in social behavior, in cognitive flexibility, and in sensory development. Recent work indicates that reciprocal interactions between serotonin and other systems, such as oxytocin, may be particularly important for social behavior. Collectively, these data point to the serotonin system as a prime candidate for treatment development in a subgroup of children defined by a robust, heritable biomarker.

AB  - Abstract
Despite decades of research, the neural circuit abnormalities underlying schizophrenia remain elusive. Although studies on schizophrenia patients have yielded important insights they have not been able to fully reveal the details of how neural circuits are disrupted in the disease, which is essential for understanding its pathophysiology and developing new treatment strategies. Animal models of schizophrenia are likely to play an important role in this effort. Such models allow neural circuit dysfunction to be investigated in detail and the role of risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms to be experimentally assessed. The goal of this review is to summarize what we have learned from electrophysiological studies that have examined neural circuit function in animal models of schizophrenia. Although these studies have revealed diverse manifestations of neural circuit dysfunction spanning multiple levels of analysis, common themes have nevertheless emerged across different studies and animal models, revealing a core set of neural circuit abnormalities. These include an imbalance between excitation and inhibition, deficits in synaptic plasticity, disruptions in local and long-range synchrony and abnormalities in dopaminergic signaling. The relevance of these findings to the pathophysiology of the disease is discussed, as well as outstanding questions for future research.

Fear conditioning is a model system used to study threat responses, fear memory and their dysregulation in a variety of organisms. Newly developed tools such as optogenetics, Cre recombinase and DREADD technologies have allowed researchers to manipulate anatomically or molecularly defined cell subtypes with a high degree of temporal control and determine the effect of this manipulation on behavior. These targeted molecular techniques have opened up a new appreciation for the critical contributions different subpopulations of cells make to fear behavior and potentially to treatment of fear and anxiety disorders. Here we review progress to date across a variety of techniques to understand fear-related behavior through the manipulation of different cell subtypes within the amygdala.

AB  - Abstract
Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous and poorly understood mental disorder that is presently defined solely by its behavioral symptoms. Advances in genetic, epidemiological and brain imaging techniques in the past half century, however, have significantly advanced our understanding of the underlying biology of the disorder. In spite of these advances clinical research remains limited in its power to establish the causal relationships that link etiology with pathophysiology and symptoms. In this context, animal models provide an important tool for causally testing hypotheses about biological processes postulated to be disrupted in the disorder. While animal models can exploit a variety of entry points toward the study of schizophrenia, here we describe an approach that seeks to closely approximate functional alterations observed with brain imaging techniques in patients. By modeling these intermediate pathophysiological alterations in animals, this approach offers an opportunity to (1) tightly link a single functional brain abnormality with its behavioral consequences, and (2) to determine whether a single pathophysiology can causally produce alterations in other brain areas that have been described in patients. In this review we first summarize a selection of well-replicated biological abnormalities described in the schizophrenia literature. We then provide examples of animal models that were studied in the context of patient imaging findings describing enhanced striatal dopamine D2 receptor function, alterations in thalamo-prefrontal circuit function, and metabolic hyperfunction of the hippocampus. Lastly, we discuss the implications of findings from these animal models for our present understanding of schizophrenia, and consider key unanswered questions for future research in animal models and human patients.

AB  - Abstract
Numerous intrinsic currents are known to collectively shape neuronal membrane potential dynamics, or neuronal signatures. Although how sets of currents shape specific signatures such as spiking characteristics or oscillations has been studied individually, it is less clear how a neuron’s suite of currents jointly shape its entire set of signatures. Biophysical conductance-based models of neurons represent a viable tool to address this important question. We hypothesized that currents are grouped into distinct modules that shape specific neuronal characteristics or signatures, such as resting potential, sub-threshold oscillations, and spiking waveforms, for several classes of neurons. For such a grouping to occur, the currents within one module should have minimal functional interference with currents belonging to other modules. This condition is satisfied if the gating functions of currents in the same module are grouped together on the voltage axis; in contrast, such functions are segregated along the voltage axis for currents belonging to different modules. We tested this hypothesis using four published example case models and found it to be valid for these classes of neurons. This insight into the neurobiological organization of currents also suggests an intuitive, systematic, and robust methodology to develop biophysical single-cell models with multiple biological characteristics applicable for both hand- and automated-tuning approaches. We illustrate the methodology using two example case rodent pyramidal neurons, from the lateral amygdala and the hippocampus. The methodology also helped reveal that a single-core compartment model could capture multiple neuronal properties. Such biophysical single-compartment models have potential to improve the fidelity of large network models.

AB  - Abstract
Eating disorders (EDs), including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge-ED, are mental illnesses characterized by high morbidity and mortality. While several studies have identified neural deficits in patients with EDs, the cellular and molecular basis of the underlying dysfunction has remained poorly understood. We previously identified a rare missense mutation in the transcription factor estrogen-related receptor alpha (ESRRA) associated with development of EDs. Because ventral-striatal signaling is related to the reward and motivation circuitry thought to underlie EDs, we performed functional and structural analysis of ventral-striatal synapses in Esrra-null mice. Esrra-null female, but not male, mice exhibit altered miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents on medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the ventral striatum, including increased frequency, increased amplitude, and decreased paired pulse ratio. These electrophysiological measures are associated with structural and molecular changes in synapses of MSNs in the ventral striatum, including fewer pre-synaptic glutamatergic vesicles and enhanced GluR1 function. Neuronal Esrra is thus required for maintaining normal synaptic function in the ventral striatum, which may offer mechanistic insights into the behavioral deficits observed in Esrra-null mice.

AB  - Abstract
Nuclear distribution element-like 1 (NDEL1/NUDEL) is a mammalian homolog of the Aspergillus nidulans nuclear distribution molecule NudE. NDEL1 plays a critical role in neuronal migration, neurite outgrowth and neuronal positioning during brain development; however within the adult central nervous system, limited information is available regarding NDEL1 expression and functions. Here, the goal was to examine inducible NDEL1 expression in the adult mouse forebrain. Immunolabeling revealed NDEL1 within the forebrain, including the cortex and hippocampus, as well as the midbrain and hypothalamus. Expression was principally localized to perikarya. Using a combination of immunolabeling and RNA seq profiling, we detected a marked and long-lasting upregulation of NDEL1 expression within the hippocampus following a pilocarpine-evoked repetitive seizure paradigm. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis identified a cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) binding site within the CpG island proximal to the NDEL1 gene, and in vivo transgenic repression of CREB led to a marked downregulation of seizure-evoked NDEL1 expression. Together these data indicate that NDEL1 is inducibly expressed in the adult nervous system, and that signaling via the CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway is likely involved. The role of NDEL1 in neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth during development raises the interesting prospect that inducible NDEL1 in the mature nervous system could contribute to the well-characterized structural and functional plasticity resulting from repetitive seizure activity.

AB  - Abstract
Illusory conjunctions (e.g. the confusion between the shape of one stimulus with the color of another stimulus) are the most dramatic expression of binding failures in vision. Under brief exposure or when attention is diverted illusory conjunctions may be observed in healthy participants, but they only represent a real-life problem for patients with parietal damage. However, it is unclear whether such failures reflect the impairment of early or late stages of visual processing. Here, we examined the time-course of visual processing using evoked potential measures in a patient with bilateral damage to the posterior parietal cortex presenting prominent binding failures. The patient was asked to identify colored letters that were briefly flashed to the left or right hemifield. When only one item was presented she adequately identified color or shape of left and right letters. In contrast, when presentation was bilateral she either identified the correct right shape-color combination and missed the item in the left hemifield (extinction) or combined incorrectly the right shape with the left color (illusory conjunction). Evoked potential analyses revealed a specific electrophysiological signature of illusory conjunctions, starting ∼105 ms after stimulus onset over the right frontal cortex. These findings indicate that binding errors reflect failures of early stages of attentional filtering relying on the integrity of the posterior parietal cortex.

AB  - Abstract
In the current study, we examined the effect of bilateral intra-dorsal hippocampal (intra-CA1) microinjections of GABAA receptor agents on amnesia induced by a β-carboline alkaloid, harmane in mice. We used a single-trial step-down passive avoidance task to assess memory retention and then, open-field test to assess locomotor activity. The results indicated that post-training intra-CA1 injections of bicuculline – a GABAA receptor antagonist – had no significant effect, while muscimol (0.01 and 0.1 μg/mouse) – a GABAA receptor agonist – impaired memory consolidation. Post-training intra-peritoneal (i.p.) infusion of harmane (3 and 5 mg/kg) decreased memory consolidation. Furthermore, post-training intra-CA1 administration of sub-threshold dose of bicuculline (0.001 μg/mouse) restored, whereas muscimol (0.001 μg/mouse) potentiated impairment of memory consolidation induced by harmane. The isobologram analysis revealed that there is an additive effect between harmane and muscimol on impairment of memory consolidation. Moreover, all above doses of drugs did not alter locomotor activity. These findings suggest that GABAA receptors of the CA1 area, at least partly, play a role in modulating the effect of harmane on memory consolidation.

AB  - Abstract
G-protein-coupled receptors are thought to be involved in the detection of umami and l-amino acid taste. These include the heterodimer taste receptor type 1 member 1 (T1r1) + taste receptor type 1 member 3 (T1r3), taste and brain variants of mGluR4 and mGluR1, and calcium sensors. While several studies suggest T1r1 + T1r3 is a broadly tuned l-amino acid receptor, little is known about the function of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in l-amino acid taste transduction. Calcium imaging of isolated taste sensory cells (TSCs) of T1r3-GFP and T1r3 knock-out (T1r3 KO) mice was performed using the ratiometric dye Fura 2 AM to investigate the role of different mGluRs in detecting various l-amino acids and inosine 5′ monophosphate (IMP). Using agonists selective for various mGluRs such as (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) (an mGluR1 agonist) and l-(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (l-AP4) (an mGluR4 agonist), we evaluated TSCs to determine if they might respond to these agonists, IMP, and three l-amino acids (monopotassium l-glutamate, l-serine and l-arginine). Additionally, we used selective antagonists against different mGluRs such as (RS)-1-aminoindan-1,5-dicarboxylic acid (AIDA) (an mGluR1 antagonist), and (RS)-α-methylserine-O-phosphate (MSOP) (an mGluR4 antagonist) to determine if they can block responses elicited by these l-amino acids and IMP. We found that l-amino acid- and IMP-responsive cells also responded to each agonist. Antagonists for mGluR4 and mGluR1 significantly blocked the responses elicited by IMP and each of the l-amino acids. Collectively, these data provide evidence for the involvement of taste and brain variants of mGluR1 and mGluR4 in l-amino acid and IMP taste responses in mice, and support the concept that multiple receptors contribute to IMP and l-amino acid taste.

The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is a network of neural oscillators that program daily rhythms in mammalian behavior and physiology. Over the last decade much has been learned about how SCN clock neurons coordinate together in time and space to form a cohesive population. Despite this insight, much remains unknown about how SCN neurons communicate with one another to produce emergent properties of the network. Here we review the current understanding of communication among SCN clock cells and highlight a collection of formal assays where changes in SCN interactions provide for plasticity in the waveform of circadian rhythms in behavior. Future studies that pair analytical behavioral assays with modern neuroscience techniques have the potential to provide deeper insight into SCN circuit mechanisms.

In this study, basic and tetanized field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded in CA1 area of hippocampus of light-(LR) and dark-reared (DR) rats (at 2, 4 and 6 weeks of age). Also, we assessed age- and activity-dependent changes in the N-Methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors subunit compositions and, GABA producing enzymes. While the sensory deprivation increased amplitude of baseline fEPSPs, it decreased degree of potentiation of post-tetanus responses. Expression of GluA1 and GluA2 subunits of AMPA receptors was increased across age in DR rats. In contrast to LR rats, mRNA and protein expression of GluN1, GluN2A and GluN2B subunits of NMDA receptors was decreased in DR ones. Also, dark rearing diminished expression of GABA synthesis enzymes GAD65 and GAD67. These results indicate that, sensory experience adjusts synaptic plasticity and might also affect the balance of excitation/inhibition in the hippocampus.

AB  - Abstract
Diversity in social structures, from solitary to eusocial, is a prominent feature of subterranean African mole-rat species. Damaraland mole-rats are eusocial, they live in colonies that are characterized by a reproductive division of labor and a subdivision into castes based on physiology and behavior. Damaraland mole-rats are exceptionally long lived and reproductive animals show delayed aging compared to non-reproductive animals. In the present study, we described the hippocampal architecture and the rate of hippocampal neurogenesis of wild-derived, adult Damaraland mole-rats in relation to sex, relative age and social status or caste. Overall, Damaraland mole-rats were found to have a small hippocampus and low rates of neurogenesis. We found no correlation between neurogenesis and sex or relative age. Social status or caste was the most prominent modulator of neurogenesis. An inverse relationship between neurogenesis and social status was apparent, with queens displaying the lowest neurogenesis while the worker mole-rats had the most. As there is no natural progression from one caste to another, social status within a colony was relatively stable and is reflected in the level of neurogenesis. Our results correspond to those found in the naked mole-rat, and may reflect an evolutionary and environmentally conserved trait within social mole-rat species.

We have seen an era of explosive progress in translating neurobiology into etiological understanding of mental disorders for the past 10–15 years. The discovery of Disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) gene was one of the major driving forces that have contributed to the progress. The finding that DISC1 plays crucial roles in neurodevelopment and synapse regulation clearly underscored the utility and validity of DISC1-related biology in advancing our understanding of pathophysiological processes underlying psychiatric conditions. Despite recent genetic studies that failed to identify DISC1 as a risk gene for sporadic cases of schizophrenia, DISC1 mutant mice, coupled with various environmental stressors, have proven successful in satisfying face validity as models of a wide range of human psychiatric conditions. Investigating mental disorders using these models is expected to further contribute to the circuit-level understanding of the pathological mechanisms, as well as to the development of novel therapeutic strategies in the future.

AB  - Abstract
Considerable epidemiological and laboratory data have suggested that caffeine, a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist, may protect against the underlying neurodegeneration of parkinson’s disease (PD). Although both caffeine and more specific antagonists of the A2A subtype of adenosine receptor (A2AR) have been found to confer protection in animal models of PD, the dependence of caffeine’s neuroprotective effects on the A2AR is not known. To definitively determine its A2AR dependence, the effect of caffeine on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6 tetra-hydropyridine (MPTP) neurotoxicity was compared in wild-type (WT) and A2AR gene global knockout (A2A KO) mice, as well as in central nervous system (CNS) cell type-specific (conditional) A2AR knockout (cKO) mice that lack the receptor either in postnatal forebrain neurons or in astrocytes. In WT and in heterozygous A2AR KO mice caffeine pretreatment (25 mg/kg ip) significantly attenuated MPTP-induced depletion of striatal dopamine. By contrast in homozygous A2AR global KO mice caffeine had no effect on MPTP toxicity. In forebrain neuron A2AR cKO mice, caffeine lost its locomotor stimulant effect, whereas its neuroprotective effect was mostly preserved. In astrocytic A2AR cKO mice, both caffeine’s locomotor stimulant and protective properties were undiminished. Taken together, these results indicate that neuroprotection by caffeine in the MPTP model of PD relies on the A2AR, although the specific cellular localization of these receptors remains to be determined.

AB  - Abstract
At tripartite synapses, astrocytes undergo calcium signaling in response to release of neurotransmitters and this calcium signaling has been proposed to play a critical role in neuron–glia interaction. Recent work has now firmly established that, in addition, neuronal activity also evokes sodium transients in astrocytes, which can be local or global depending on the number of activated synapses and the duration of activity. Furthermore, astrocyte sodium signals can be transmitted to adjacent cells through gap junctions and following release of gliotransmitters. A main pathway for activity-related sodium influx into astrocytes is via high-affinity sodium-dependent glutamate transporters. Astrocyte sodium signals differ in many respects from the well-described glial calcium signals both in terms of their temporal as well as spatial distribution. There are no known buffering systems for sodium ions, nor is there store-mediated release of sodium. Sodium signals thus seem to represent rather direct and unbiased indicators of the site and strength of neuronal inputs. As such they have an immediate influence on the activity of sodium-dependent transporters which may even reverse in response to sodium signaling, as has been shown for GABA transporters for example. Furthermore, recovery from sodium transients through Na+/K+-ATPase requires a measurable amount of ATP, resulting in an activation of glial metabolism. In this review, we present basic principles of sodium regulation and the current state of knowledge concerning the occurrence and properties of activity-related sodium transients in astrocytes. We then discuss different aspects of the relationship between sodium changes in astrocytes and neuro-metabolic coupling, putting forward the idea that indeed sodium might serve as a new type of intracellular ion signal playing an important role in neuron–glia interaction and neuro-metabolic coupling in the healthy and diseased brain.

AB  - Abstract
The effects of intense noise exposure on the classical auditory pathway have been extensively investigated; however, little is known about the effects of noise-induced hearing loss on non-classical auditory areas in the brain such as the lateral amygdala (LA) and striatum (Str). To address this issue, we compared the noise-induced changes in spontaneous and tone-evoked responses from multiunit clusters (MUC) in the LA and Str with those seen in auditory cortex (AC) in rats. High-frequency octave band noise (10–20 kHz) and narrow band noise (16–20 kHz) induced permanent threshold shifts at high-frequencies within and above the noise band but not at low frequencies. While the noise trauma significantly elevated spontaneous discharge rate (SR) in the AC, SRs in the LA and Str were only slightly increased across all frequencies. The high-frequency noise trauma affected tone-evoked firing rates in frequency and time-dependent manner and the changes appeared to be related to the severity of noise trauma. In the LA, tone-evoked firing rates were reduced at the high-frequencies (trauma area) whereas firing rates were enhanced at the low-frequencies or at the edge-frequency dependent on severity of hearing loss at the high frequencies. The firing rate temporal profile changed from a broad plateau to one sharp, delayed peak. In the AC, tone-evoked firing rates were depressed at high frequencies and enhanced at the low frequencies while the firing rate temporal profiles became substantially broader. In contrast, firing rates in the Str were generally decreased and firing rate temporal profiles become more phasic and less prolonged. The altered firing rate and pattern at low frequencies induced by high-frequency hearing loss could have perceptual consequences. The tone-evoked hyperactivity in low-frequency MUC could manifest as hyperacusis whereas the discharge pattern changes could affect temporal resolution and integration.

AB  - Abstract
Spreading depression (SD), a slow propagating depolarization wave, plays an important role in pathophysiology of different neurological disorders. Yet, research into SD-related disorders has been hampered by the lack of non-invasive recording techniques of SD. Here we compared the manifestations of SD in continuous non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings to invasive electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings in order to obtain further insights into generator structures and electrogenic mechanisms of surface recording of SD. SD was induced by KCl application and simultaneous SD recordings were performed by scalp EEG as well as ECoG electrodes of somatosensory neocortex of rats using a novel homemade EEG amplifier, AgCl recording electrodes, and high chloride conductive gel. Different methods were used to analyze the data; including the spectrogram, bi-spectrogram, pattern distribution, relative spectrum power, and multivariable Gaussian fit analysis. The negative direct current (DC) shifts recorded by scalp electrodes exhibited a high homogeneity to those recorded by ECoG electrodes. Furthermore, this novel method of recording and analysis was able to separate SD recorded by scalp electrodes from non-neuronal DC shifts induced by other potential generators, such as the skin, muscles, arteries, dura, etc. These data suggest a novel application for continuous non-invasive monitoring of DC potential changes, such as SD. Non-invasive monitoring of SD would allow early intervention and improve outcome in SD-related neurological disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Although lipid peroxidation has long been associated with spinal cord injury (SCI), the specific role of lipid peroxidation-derived byproducts such as acrolein in mediating damage remains to be fully understood. Acrolein, an α-β unsaturated aldehyde, is highly reactive with proteins, DNA, and phospholipids and is considered as a second toxic messenger that disseminates and augments initial free radical events. Previously, we showed that acrolein increased following traumatic SCI and injection of acrolein induced tissue damage. Here, we demonstrate that microinjection of acrolein into the thoracic spinal cord of adult rats resulted in dose-dependent tissue damage and functional deficits. At 24 h (acute) after the microinjection, tissue damage, motoneuron loss, and spinal cord swelling were observed on sections stained with Cresyl Violet. Luxol fast blue staining further showed that acrolein injection resulted in dose-dependent demyelination. At 8 weeks (chronic) after the microinjection, cord shrinkage, astrocyte activation, and macrophage infiltration were observed along with tissue damage, neuron loss, and demyelination. These pathological changes resulted in behavioral impairments as measured by both the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating scale and grid walking analysis. Electron microscopy further demonstrated that acrolein induced axonal degeneration, demyelination, and macrophage infiltration. These results, combined with our previous reports, strongly suggest that acrolein may play a critical causal role in the pathogenesis of SCI and that targeting acrolein could be an attractive strategy for repair after SCI.

AB  - Abstract
Verbal fluency refers to the ability to generate as many words as possible in a limited time interval, without repetition and according to either a phonologic (each word begins with a given letter) or a semantic rule (each word belongs to a given semantic category). While current literature suggests the involvement of left fronto-temporal structures in fluency tasks, whether the same or distinct brain areas are necessary for each type of fluency remains unclear.

We tested the hypothesis for an involvement of partly segregated cortico-subcortical structures between phonologic and semantic fluency by examining with a voxel-based lesion symptom mapping approach the effects of brain lesions on fluency scores corrected for age and education level in a group of 191 unselected brain-damaged patients with a first left or right hemispheric lesion.

There was a positive correlation between the scores to the two types of fluency, suggesting that common mechanisms underlie the word generation independent of the production rule. The lesion-symptom mapping revealed that lesions to left basal ganglia impaired both types of fluency and that left superior temporal, supramarginal and rolandic operculum lesions selectively impaired phonologic fluency and left middle temporal lesions impaired semantic fluency.

Our results corroborate current neurocognitive models of word retrieval and production, and refine the role of cortical-subcortical interaction in lexical search by highlighting the common executive role of basal ganglia in both types of verbal fluency and the preferential involvement of the ventral and dorsal language pathway in semantic and phonologic fluency, respectively.

AB  - Abstract
Propofol, a widely used anesthetic, can cause addictive behaviors in both human and experimental animals. In the present study, we examined the involvement of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling in the molecular process by which propofol may cause addiction. The propofol self-administration model was established by a fixed ratio 1 (FR1) schedule of reinforced dosing over successive 14 days in rats. On day 15, the rats were treated with dexamethasone, a GR agonist (10–100 μg/kg), or RU486, a GR antagonist (10–100 μg/kg) at 1 h prior to the last training. The animal behaviors were recorded automatically by the computer. The expression of dopamine D1 receptor in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) was examined by Western blot and the concentrations of plasma corticosterone were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To further examine the specificity of GR in the process, mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist, spironolactone, and dexamethasone plus MR agonist, aldosterone, were also tested. Administration of dexamethasone (100 μg/kg) or RU486 (⩾10 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the rate of propofol maintained active nose-poke responses and infusions, which were accompanied by reductions in both plasma corticosterone level and the expression of D1 receptor in the NAc. Neither spironolactone alone nor dexamethasone combined with aldosterone affected the propofol-maintaining self-administrative behavior, indicating GR, but not MR, modulates the propofol reward in rats. In addition, neither the food-maintaining sucrose responses under FR1 schedule nor the locomotor activity was affected by any doses of dexamethasone or RU486 tested. These findings provide evidence that GR signaling may play an important role in propofol reward.

AB  - Abstract
Autism susceptibility candidate 2 (AUTS2) is a gene associated with autism and mental retardation. Recent studies have suggested an association of the AUTS2 gene with heroin dependence, and reduced AUTS2 gene expression may confer increased susceptibility to heroin dependence. However, the functional role of the AUTS2 protein in regulating enduring neuroadaptations in response to heroin exposure has not been established. Here, we investigated the effects of acute and chronic heroin exposure on AUTS2 mRNA and protein expression in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and caudate-putamen (CPu) to determine whether changes in AUTS2 expression are associated with heroin-induced locomotor sensitization in mice. Moreover, we explored whether AUST2 knockdown affects heroin-induced locomotor sensitization. AUTS2 mRNA and protein expression in the NAc, but not the CPu, was decreased after chronic heroin (1 mg/kg) administration. In the NAc, the expression of heroin-induced locomotor sensitization was enhanced through the lentiviral-AUTS2-shRNA-mediated knockdown of AUTS2, while the overexpression of AUTS2 attenuated the locomotor-stimulant effects of heroin. Together, these results indicate that AUTS2 in the NAc, but not the CPu, suppresses the initiation and expression of heroin-induced behavioral sensitization, suggesting that AUST2 may be a potential target for the treatment of heroin dependence.

AB  - Abstract
Short-term exposure to nicotine induces positive effects in mice, monkeys and humans, including mild euphoria, hyperactivity, and enhanced cognition. However, the underlying neural basis and molecular mechanisms for these effects remain poorly understood. Here, using a video recording system, we find that acute nicotine administration induces locomotor hyperactivity in Drosophila, similar to observations made in higher model organisms. Suppressing dopaminergic neurons or down-regulating dopamine 1-like receptor (DopR) abolishes this acute nicotine response, but surprisingly, does so only in male flies. Using a GFP reconstitution across synaptic partners (GRASP) approach, we show that dopaminergic neurons possess potential synaptic connections with acetylcholinergic neurons in wide regions of the brain. Furthermore, dopaminergic neurons are widely activated upon nicotine perfusion in both sexes, while the response curve differs significantly between the sexes. Moreover, knockdown of the β1 nicotine acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in dopaminergic neurons abolishes the acute nicotine response only in male flies, while panneural knock-down occurs in both sexes. Taken together, our results reveal that in fruit flies, dopaminergic neurons mediate nicotine-induced acute locomotor hyperactivity in a sexually dimorphic manner, and Drosophila β1 nAChR subunit plays a crucial role in this nicotine response. These findings provide important insights into the molecular and neural basis of acute nicotine effects, and the underlying mechanisms may play conserved roles across species.

Internet-searching behaviors may change ways in which we find, store and consider information. In this study, we tested the effect of short-term Internet-search practicing on recollection processes. Fifty-nine human subjects with valid data (Experimental group, 43; Control group, 16) completed procedures involving a pre-test, 6 days of practicing, and a post-test. Behavioral and imaging results were obtained and within- and between-group comparisons were made at pre-test and post-test times. With respect to behavioral performance, six days of practicing was associated with improved behavioral performance during Internet searching: subjects in the experimental group showed shorter response times (RTs) and similar accuracy rates during recollection at post-test as compared to pre-test. During imaging and as compared to pre-test data, subjects in the experimental group showed during post-test recall relatively decreased brain activations bilaterally in the middle frontal and temporal gyri. Such findings were not observed in the control group. The findings suggest that six days of practicing Internet searching may improve the efficiency of Internet searching without influencing the accuracy of recollection, with neuroimaging results implicating cortical regions involved in long-term memory and executive processing.
