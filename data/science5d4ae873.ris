AB  - Summary
Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors (NMDA-Rs) triggers synaptic plasticity, gene transcription, and cytotoxicity, but little is known about the regulation of NMDA-Rs themselves. We used two-photon glutamate uncaging to activate NMDA-Rs on individual dendritic spines in rat CA1 neurons while we measured NMDA-R currents at the soma and [Ca2+] changes in spines. Low-frequency uncaging trains induced Ca2+-dependent long-term depression of NMDA-R-mediated synaptic currents. Additionally, uncaging trains caused a reduction in the Ca2+ accumulation per unit of NMDA-R current in spines due to a reduction in the fraction of the NMDA-R current carried by Ca2+. Induction of depression of NMDA-R-mediated Ca2+ influx required activation of NR2B-containing receptors. Receptors in single spines depressed rapidly in an all-or-none manner. These adaptive changes in NMDA-R function likely play a critical role in metaplasticity and in stabilizing activity levels in neuronal networks with Hebbian synapses.

AB  - Summary
Under ambient air conditions, NO inhibits NMDAR activity by reacting with the NR2A subunit C399 along with two additional cysteine pairs if their disulfide bonds are reduced to free thiol groups [NR1(C744,C798); NR2(C87,C320)]. Here we demonstrate that relative hypoxia enhances S-nitrosylation of NMDARs by a unique mechanism involving an “NO-reactive oxygen sensor motif” whose determinants include C744 and C798 of the NR1 subunit. Redox reactions involving these two thiol groups sensitize other NMDAR sites to S-nitrosylation and consequent receptor inhibition, while their own nitrosylation has little effect on NMDAR activity. The crystal structure of the ligand-binding domain of NR1 reveals a flexible disulfide bond (C744-C798), which may account for its susceptibility to reduction and subsequent reaction with NO that is observed with biochemical techniques. These thiols may be nitrosylated preferentially during increasing hypoxia or stroke conditions, thus preventing excessive activity associated with cytotoxicity while avoiding blockade of physiologically active NMDARs.

AB  - Summary
A remarkable problem in neurobiology is how olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) select, from among a large odor receptor repertoire, which receptors to express. We use computational algorithms and mutational analysis to define positive and negative regulatory elements that are required for selection of odor receptor (Or) genes in the proper olfactory organ of Drosophila, and we identify an element that is essential for selection in one ORN class. Two odor receptors are coexpressed by virtue of the alternative splicing of a single gene, and we identify dicistronic mRNAs that each encode two receptors. Systematic analysis reveals no evidence for negative feedback regulation, but provides evidence that the choices made by neighboring ORNs of a sensillum are coordinated via the asymmetric segregation of regulatory factors from a common progenitor. We show that receptor gene choice in Drosophila also depends on a combinatorial code of transcription factors to generate the receptor-to-neuron map.

AB  - Summary
The cAMP and ERK/MAP kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathways are critical for hippocampus-dependent memory, a process that depends on CREB-mediated transcription. However, the extent of crosstalk between these pathways and the downstream CREB kinase activated during memory formation has not been elucidated. Here we report that PKA, MAPK, and MSK1, a CREB kinase, are coactivated in a subset of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons following contextual fear conditioning. Activation of PKA, MAPK, MSK1, and CREB is absolutely dependent on Ca2+-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. We conclude that adenylyl cyclase activity supports the activation of MAPK, and that MSK1 is the major CREB kinase activated during training for contextual memory.

AB  - Summary
It was recently discovered that subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations of cortical neurons can precisely repeat during spontaneous activity, seconds to minutes apart, both in brain slices and in anesthetized animals. These repeats, also called cortical motifs, were suggested to reflect a replay of sequential neuronal firing patterns. We searched for motifs in spontaneous activity, recorded from the rat barrel cortex and from the cat striate cortex of anesthetized animals, and found numerous repeating patterns of high similarity and repetition rates. To test their significance, various statistics were compared between physiological data and three different types of stochastic surrogate data that preserve dynamical characteristics of the recorded data. We found no evidence for the existence of deterministically generated cortical motifs. Rather, the stochastic properties of cortical motifs suggest that they appear by chance, as a result of the constraints imposed by the coarse dynamics of subthreshold ongoing activity.

AB  - Summary
Excitotoxicity mediated by glutamate receptors plays crucial roles in ischemia and other neurodegenerative diseases. Whereas overactivation of ionotropic glutamate receptors is neurotoxic, the role of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), and especially mGluR1, remains equivocal. Here we report that activation of NMDA receptors results in calpain-mediated truncation of the C-terminal domain of mGluR1α at Ser936. The truncated mGluR1α maintains its ability to increase cytosolic calcium while it no longer activates the neuroprotective PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Full-length and truncated forms of mGluR1α play distinct roles in excitotoxic neuronal degeneration in cultured neurons. A fusion peptide derived from the calpain cleavage site of mGluR1α efficiently blocks NMDA-induced truncation of mGluR1α in primary neuronal cultures and exhibits neuroprotection against excitotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. These findings shed light on the relationship between NMDA and mGluR1α and indicate the existence of a positive feedback regulation in excitotoxicity involving calpain and mGluR1α.

Recent studies have identified stem cells in brain cancer. However, their relationship to normal CNS progenitors, including dependence on common lineage-restricted pathways, is unclear. We observe expression of the CNS-restricted transcription factor, OLIG2, in human glioma stem and progenitor cells reminiscent of type C transit-amplifying cells in germinal zones of the adult brain. Olig2 function is required for proliferation of neural progenitors and for glioma formation in a genetically relevant murine model. Moreover, we show p21WAF1/CIP1, a tumor suppressor and inhibitor of stem cell proliferation, is directly repressed by OLIG2 in neural progenitors and gliomas. Our findings identify an Olig2-regulated lineage-restricted pathway critical for proliferation of normal and tumorigenic CNS stem cells.

The role of the corpus callosum (CC) in the interhemispheric interaction of prosodic and syntactic information during speech comprehension was investigated in patients with lesions in the CC, and in healthy controls. The event-related brain potential experiment examined the effect of prosodic phrase structure on the processing of a verb whose argument structure matched or did not match the prior prosody-induced syntactic structure. While controls showed an N400-like effect for prosodically mismatching verb argument structures, thus indicating a stable interplay between prosody and syntax, patients with lesions in the posterior third of the CC did not show this effect. Because these patients displayed a prosody-independent semantic N400 effect, the present data indicate that the posterior third of the CC is the crucial neuroanatomical structure for the interhemispheric interplay of suprasegmental prosodic information and syntactic information.

AB  - Summary
Persistence is the most characteristic attribute of long-term memory (LTM). To understand LTM, we must understand how memory traces persist over time despite the short-lived nature and rapid turnover of their molecular substrates. It is widely accepted that LTM formation is dependent upon hippocampal de novo protein synthesis and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) signaling during or early after acquisition. Here we show that 12 hr after acquisition of a one-trial associative learning task, there is a novel protein synthesis and BDNF-dependent phase in the rat hippocampus that is critical for the persistence of LTM storage. Our findings indicate that a delayed stabilization phase is specifically required for maintenance, but not formation, of the memory trace. We propose that memory formation and memory persistence share some of the same molecular mechanisms and that recurrent rounds of consolidation-like events take place in the hippocampus for maintenance of the memory trace.

AB  - Summary
GABAB receptors are heterodimeric G protein-coupled receptors composed of R1 and R2 subunits that mediate slow synaptic inhibition in the brain by activating inwardly rectifying K+ channels (GIRKs) and inhibiting Ca2+ channels. We demonstrate here that GABAB receptors are intimately associated with 5′AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK acts as a metabolic sensor that is potently activated by increases in 5′AMP concentration that are caused by enhanced metabolic activity, anoxia, or ischemia. AMPK binds the R1 subunit and directly phosphorylates S783 in the R2 subunit to enhance GABAB receptor activation of GIRKs. Phosphorylation of S783 is evident in many brain regions, and is increased dramatically after ischemic injury. Finally, we also reveal that S783 plays a critical role in enhancing neuronal survival after ischemia. Together our results provide evidence of a neuroprotective mechanism, which, under conditions of metabolic stress or after ischemia, increases GABAB receptor function to reduce excitotoxicity and thereby promotes neuronal survival.

AB  - Summary
Rats use their whiskers to locate and discriminate tactile features of their environment. Mechanoreceptors surrounding each whisker encode and transmit sensory information from the environment to the brain via afferents whose cell bodies lie in the trigeminal ganglion (Vg). These afferents are classified as rapidly (RA) or slowly (SA) adapting by their response to stimulation. The activity of these cells in the awake behaving rat is yet unknown. Therefore, we developed a method to chronically record Vg neurons during natural whisking behaviors and found that all cells exhibited (1) no neuronal activity when the whiskers were not in motion, (2) increased activity when the rat whisked, with activity correlated to whisk frequency, and (3) robust increases in activity when the whiskers contacted an object. Moreover, we observed distinct differences in the firing rates between RA and SA cells, suggesting that they encode distinct aspects of stimuli in the awake rat.

AB  - Summary
Signal transduction through heterotrimeric G proteins is critical for sensory response across species. Regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins are negative regulators of signal transduction. Herein we describe a role for C. elegans RGS-3 in the regulation of sensory behaviors. rgs-3 mutant animals fail to respond to intense sensory stimuli but respond normally to low concentrations of specific odorants. We find that loss of RGS-3 leads to aberrantly increased G protein-coupled calcium signaling but decreased synaptic output, ultimately leading to behavioral defects. Thus, rgs-3 responses are restored by decreasing G protein-coupled signal transduction, either genetically or by exogenous dopamine, by expressing a calcium-binding protein to buffer calcium levels in sensory neurons or by enhancing glutamatergic synaptic transmission from sensory neurons. Therefore, while RGS proteins generally act to downregulate signaling, loss of a specific RGS protein in sensory neurons can lead to defective responses to external stimuli.

Microeconomic theory maintains that purchases are driven by a combination of consumer preference and price. Using event-related fMRI, we investigated how people weigh these factors to make purchasing decisions. Consistent with neuroimaging evidence suggesting that distinct circuits anticipate gain and loss, product preference activated the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), while excessive prices activated the insula and deactivated the mesial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) prior to the purchase decision. Activity from each of these regions independently predicted immediately subsequent purchases above and beyond self-report variables. These findings suggest that activation of distinct neural circuits related to anticipatory affect precedes and supports consumers' purchasing decisions.

Much less is known about patterns of recruitment in the spinal interneurons that control motoneurons because of the difficulties of monitoring activity simultaneously in multiple interneurons of an identified class. Here we use electrophysiology in combination with in vivo calcium imaging of groups of identified excitatory spinal interneurons in larval zebrafish to explore how they are recruited during different forms of the escape response that fish use to avoid predators. Our evidence indicates that escape movements are graded largely by differences in the level of activity within an active pool of interneurons rather than by the recruitment of an inactive subset.

AB  - Summary
Axon-axon interactions have been implicated in neural circuit assembly, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that in the Drosophila antennal lobe, early-arriving axons of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) from the antenna are required for the proper targeting of late-arriving ORN axons from the maxillary palp (MP). Semaphorin-1a is required for targeting of all MP but only half of the antennal ORN classes examined. Sema-1a acts nonautonomously to control ORN axon-axon interactions, in contrast to its cell-autonomous function in olfactory projection neurons. Phenotypic and genetic interaction analyses implicate PlexinA as the Sema-1a receptor in ORN targeting. Sema-1a on antennal ORN axons is required for correct targeting of MP axons within the antennal lobe, while interactions amongst MP axons facilitate their entry into the antennal lobe. We propose that Sema-1a/PlexinA-mediated repulsion provides a mechanism by which early-arriving ORN axons constrain the target choices of late-arriving axons.

AB  - Summary
Nerve growth factor engages two structurally distinct transmembrane receptors, TrkA and p75, which have been proposed to create a “high-affinity” NGF binding site through formation of a ternary TrkA/NGF/p75 complex. To define a structural basis for the high-affinity site, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of a complete extracellular domain of TrkA complexed with NGF. The complex reveals a crab-shaped homodimeric TrkA structure, but a mechanism for p75 coordination is not obvious. We investigated the heterodimerization of membrane-bound TrkA and p75, on intact mammalian cells, using a β-gal protein-protein interaction system. We find that NGF dimerizes TrkA and that p75 exists on the cell surface as a preformed oligomer that is not dissociated by NGF. We find no evidence for a direct TrkA/p75 interaction. We propose that TrkA and p75 likely communicate through convergence of downstream signaling pathways and/or shared adaptor molecules, rather than through direct extracellular interactions.

The size of the movement and the molecular identity of the moving parts of the voltage sensor of a voltage-gated ion channel are debated. In the helical-screw model, the positively charged fourth transmembrane segment S4 slides and rotates along negative counter charges in S2 and S3, while in the paddle model, S4 carries the extracellular part of S3 (S3b) as a cargo. Here, we show that S4 slides 16–26 Å along S3b. We introduced pairs of cysteines in S4 and S3b of the Shaker K channel to make disulfide bonds. Residue 325 in S3b makes close and state-dependent contacts with a long stretch of residues in S4. A disulfide bond between 325 and 360 was formed in the closed state, while a bond between 325 and 366 was formed in the open state. These data are not compatible with the voltage-sensor paddle model, but support the helical-screw model.

AB  - Summary
Motion vision is an ancient faculty, critical to many animals in a range of ethological contexts, the underlying algorithms of which provide central insights into neural computation. However, how motion cues guide behavior is poorly understood, as the neural circuits that implement these computations are largely unknown in any organism. We develop a systematic, forward genetic approach using high-throughput, quantitative behavioral analyses to identify the neural substrates of motion vision in Drosophila in an unbiased fashion. We then delimit the behavioral contributions of both known and novel circuit elements. Contrary to expectation from previous studies, we find that orienting responses to motion are shaped by at least two neural pathways. These pathways are sensitive to different visual features, diverge immediately postsynaptic to photoreceptors, and are coupled to distinct behavioral outputs. Thus, behavioral responses to complex stimuli can rely on surprising neural specialization from even the earliest sensory processing stages.

AB  - Summary
Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) induce long-term depression (LTD) that requires protein synthesis. Here, we demonstrate that Arc/Arg3.1 is translationally induced within 5 min of mGluR activation, and this response is essential for mGluR-dependent LTD. The increase in Arc/Arg3.1 translation requires eEF2K, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase that binds mGluR and dissociates upon mGluR activation, whereupon it phosphorylates eEF2. Phospho-eEF2 acts to slow the elongation step of translation and inhibits general protein synthesis but simultaneously increases Arc/Arg3.1 translation. Genetic deletion of eEF2K results in a selective deficit of rapid mGluR-dependent Arc/Arg3.1 translation and mGluR-LTD. This rapid translational mechanism is disrupted in the fragile X disease mouse (Fmr1 KO) in which mGluR-LTD does not require de novo protein synthesis but does require Arc/Arg3.1. We propose a model in which eEF2K-eEF2 and FMRP coordinately control the dynamic translation of Arc/Arg3.1 mRNA in dendrites that is critical for synapse-specific LTD.

AB  - Summary
Persistent drug-seeking behavior is hypothesized to co-opt the brain's natural reward-motivational system. Although ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons represent a crucial component of this system, the synaptic adaptations underlying natural rewards and drug-related motivation have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that self-administration of cocaine, but not passive cocaine infusions, produced a persistent potentiation of VTA excitatory synapses, which was still present after 3 months abstinence. Further, enhanced synaptic function in VTA was evident even after 3 weeks of extinction training. Food or sucrose self-administration induced only a transient potentiation of VTA glutamatergic signaling. Our data show that synaptic function in VTA DA neurons is readily but reversibly enhanced by natural reward-seeking behavior, while voluntary cocaine self-administration induced a persistent synaptic enhancement that is resistant to behavioral extinction. Such persistent synaptic potentiation in VTA DA neurons may represent a fundamental cellular phenomenon driving pathological drug-seeking behavior.

AB  - Summary
Synapse elimination is an important process underlying the establishment of functional neuronal networks during development. Here, we tested the idea that neurons select among potential synaptic partners already during initial contact formation between dendritic filopodia and axons—well before mature synapses are established. We show that filopodia frequently make contact with axons, and while some contacts are selectively stabilized, many are short-lived. More specifically, we demonstrate that contacts with a certain population of GABAergic axons never get stabilized, indicating that filopodia already early on select between different types of axons. Local dendritic calcium transients that are independent of glutamate occur within seconds after contact formation, and their frequency is high where contacts become stabilized and low at short-lived contacts. Thus, filopodia are capable of choosing between potential synaptic partners well before a mature synapse is established.

AB  - Summary
Early sensory processing can play a critical role in sensing environmental cues. We have investigated the physiological and behavioral function of gain control at the first synapse of olfactory processing in Drosophila. Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) express the GABAB receptor (GABABR), and its expression expands the dynamic range of ORN synaptic transmission that is preserved in projection neuron responses. Strikingly, each ORN channel has a unique baseline level of GABABR expression. ORNs that sense the aversive odorant CO2 do not express GABABRs and do not have significant presynaptic inhibition. In contrast, pheromone-sensing ORNs express a high level of GABABRs and exhibit strong presynaptic inhibition. Furthermore, pheromone-dependent mate localization is impaired in flies that lack GABABRs in specific ORNs. These findings indicate that different olfactory receptor channels employ heterogeneous presynaptic gain control as a mechanism to allow an animal's innate behavioral responses to match its ecological needs.

AB  - Summary
Both the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) contribute to learned behavioral choice. Neurons in both structures that encode reward-predictive cues may underlie the decision to respond to such cues, but the neural circuits by which the BLA influences reward-seeking behavior have not been established. Here, we test the hypothesis that the BLA drives NAc neuronal responses to reward-predictive cues. First, using a disconnection experiment, we show that the BLA and dopamine projections to the NAc interact to promote the reward-seeking behavioral response. Next, we demonstrate that BLA neuronal responses to cues precede those of NAc neurons and that cue-evoked excitation of NAc neurons depends on BLA input. These results indicate that BLA input is required for dopamine to enhance the cue-evoked firing of NAc neurons and that this enhanced firing promotes reward-seeking behavior.

AB  - Summary
AMPA-type glutamate receptors (GluRs) play major roles in excitatory synaptic transmission. Neuronal AMPA receptors comprise GluR subunits and transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs). Previous studies identified five mammalian TARPs, γ-2 (or stargazin), γ-3, γ-4, γ-7, and γ-8, that enhance AMPA receptor function. Here, we classify γ-5 as a distinct class of TARP that modulates specific GluR2-containing AMPA receptors and displays properties entirely dissimilar from canonical TARPs. γ-5 increases peak currents and decreases the steady-state currents selectively from GluR2-containing AMPA receptors. Furthermore, γ-5 increases rates of GluR2 deactivation and desensitization and decreases glutamate potency. Remarkably, all effects of γ-5 require editing of GluR2 mRNA. Unlike other TARPs, γ-5 modulates GluR2 without promoting receptor trafficking. We also find that γ-7 regulation of GluR2 is dictated by mRNA editing. These data establish γ-5 and γ-7 as a separate family of “type II TARPs” that impart distinct physiological features to specific AMPA receptors.

AB  - Summary
A single exposure to drugs of abuse produces an NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) currents in DA neurons; however, the importance of LTP for various aspects of drug addiction is unclear. To test the role of NMDAR-dependent plasticity in addictive behavior, we genetically inactivated functional NMDAR signaling exclusively in DA neurons (KO mice). Inactivation of NMDARs results in increased AMPAR-mediated transmission that is indistinguishable from the increases associated with a single cocaine exposure, yet locomotor responses to multiple drugs of abuse were unaltered in the KO mice. The initial phase of locomotor sensitization to cocaine is intact; however, the delayed sensitization that occurs with prolonged cocaine withdrawal did not occur. Conditioned behavioral responses for cocaine-testing environment were also absent in the KO mice. These findings provide evidence for a role of NMDAR signaling in DA neurons for specific behavioral modifications associated with drug seeking behaviors.

Finally, new studies have elucidated the role by which presenilins modulate calcium signaling, including effects on SERCA2b and gating of the IP3 receptor, and lead to Aβ production.

Although rod and cone photoreceptor cells in the vertebrate retina are anatomically connected or coupled by gap junctions, a type of electrical synapse, rod-cone electrical coupling is thought to be weak. Using tracer labeling and electrical recording in the goldfish retina and tracer labeling in the mouse retina, we show that the retinal circadian clock, and not the retinal response to the visual environment, controls the extent and strength of rod-cone coupling by activating dopamine D2-like receptors in the day, so that rod-cone coupling is weak during the day but remarkably robust at night. The results demonstrate that circadian control of rod-cone electrical coupling serves as a synaptic switch that allows cones to receive very dim light signals from rods at night, but not in the day. The increase in the strength and extent of rod-cone coupling at night may facilitate the detection of large dim objects.

AB  - Summary
As a disease-modifying approach for Alzheimer's disease (AD), clioquinol (CQ) targets β-amyloid (Aß) reactions with synaptic Zn and Cu yet promotes metal uptake. Here we characterize the second-generation 8-hydroxy quinoline analog PBT2, which also targets metal-induced aggregation of Aß, but is more effective as a Zn/Cu ionophore and has greater blood-brain barrier permeability. Given orally to two types of amyloid-bearing transgenic mouse models of AD, PBT2 outperformed CQ by markedly decreasing soluble interstitial brain Aß within hours and improving cognitive performance to exceed that of normal littermate controls within days. Nontransgenic mice were unaffected by PBT2. The current data demonstrate that ionophore activity, inhibition of in vitro metal-mediated Aß reactions, and blood-brain barrier permeability are indices that predict a potential disease-modifying drug for AD. The speed of recovery of the animals underscores the acutely reversible nature of the cognitive deficits associated with transgenic models of AD.

AB  - Summary
Functional models of the early visual system should predict responses not only to simple artificial stimuli but also to sequences of complex natural scenes. An ideal testbed for such models is the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Mechanisms shaping LGN responses include the linear receptive field and two fast adaptation processes, sensitive to luminance and contrast. We propose a compact functional model for these mechanisms that operates on sequences of arbitrary images. With the same parameters that fit the firing rate responses to simple stimuli, it predicts the bulk of the firing rate responses to complex stimuli, including natural scenes. Further improvements could result by adding a spiking mechanism, possibly one capable of bursts, but not by adding mechanisms of slow adaptation. We conclude that up to the LGN the responses to natural scenes can be largely explained through insights gained with simple artificial stimuli.

AB  - Summary
Rapid optimization of behavior requires decisions about when to explore and when to exploit discovered resources. The mechanisms that lead to fast adaptations and their interaction with action valuation are a central issue. We show here that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) encodes multiple feedbacks devoted to exploration and its immediate termination. In a task that alternates exploration and exploitation periods, the ACC monitored negative and positive outcomes relevant for different adaptations. In particular, it produced signals specific of the first reward, i.e., the end of exploration. Those signals disappeared in exploitation periods but immediately transferred to the initiation of trials—a transfer comparable to learning phenomena observed for dopaminergic neurons. Importantly, these were also observed for high gamma oscillations of local field potentials shown to correlate with brain imaging signal. Thus, mechanisms of action valuation and monitoring of events/actions are combined for rapid behavioral regulation.

AB  - Summary
Quantitative differences in cadherin activity have been proposed to play important roles in patterning connections between pre- and postsynaptic neurons. However, no examples of such a function have yet been described, and the mechanisms that would allow such differences to direct growth cones to specific synaptic targets are unknown. In the Drosophila visual system, photoreceptors are genetically programmed to make a complex, stereotypic set of synaptic connections. Here we show that the atypical cadherin Flamingo functions as a short-range, homophilic signal, passing between specific R cell growth cones to influence their choice of postsynaptic partners. We find that individual growth cones are sensitive to differences in Flamingo activity through opposing interactions between neighboring cells and require these interactions to be balanced in order to extend along the appropriate trajectory.

AB  - Summary
Synaptic connections are stabilized through transsynaptic adhesion complexes that are anchored in the underlying cytoskeleton. The Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJs) serves as a model system to unravel genes required for the structural remodeling of synapses. In a mutagenesis screen for regulators of synaptic stability, we recovered mutations in Drosophila ankyrin 2 (ank2) affecting two giant Ank2 isoforms that are specifically expressed in the nervous system and associate with the presynaptic membrane cytoskeleton. ank2 mutant larvae show severe deficits in the stability of NMJs, resulting in a reduction in overall terminal size, withdrawal of synaptic boutons, and disassembly of presynaptic active zones. In addition, lack of Ank2 leads to disintegration of the synaptic microtubule cytoskeleton. Microtubules and microtubule-associated proteins fail to extend into distant boutons. Interestingly, Ank2 functions downstream of spectrin in the anchorage of synaptic microtubules, providing the cytoskeletal scaffold that is essential for synaptic stability.

AB  - Summary
Despite an increasing focus on the neural basis of human decision making in neuroscience, relatively little attention has been paid to decision making in social settings. Moreover, although human social decision making has been explored in a social psychology context, few neural explanations for the observed findings have been considered. To bridge this gap and improve models of human social decision making, we investigated whether acquiring a good reputation, which is an important incentive in human social behaviors, activates the same reward circuitry as monetary rewards. In total, 19 subjects participated in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments involving monetary and social rewards. The acquisition of one's good reputation robustly activated reward-related brain areas, notably the striatum, and these overlapped with the areas activated by monetary rewards. Our findings support the idea of a “common neural currency” for rewards and represent an important first step toward a neural explanation for complex human social behaviors.

AB  - Summary
Cortical inhibition plays an important role in shaping neuronal processing. The underlying synaptic mechanisms remain controversial. Here, in vivo whole-cell recordings from neurons in the rat primary auditory cortex revealed that the frequency tuning curve of inhibitory input was broader than that of excitatory input. This results in relatively stronger inhibition in frequency domains flanking the preferred frequencies of the cell and a significant sharpening of the frequency tuning of membrane responses. The less selective inhibition can be attributed to a broader bandwidth and lower threshold of spike tonal receptive field of fast-spike inhibitory neurons than nearby excitatory neurons, although both types of neurons receive similar ranges of excitatory input and are organized into the same tonotopic map. Thus, the balance between excitation and inhibition is only approximate, and intracortical inhibition with high sensitivity and low selectivity can laterally sharpen the frequency tuning of neurons, ensuring their highly selective representation.

AB  - Summary
Aggregation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide into soluble and insoluble forms within the brain extracellular space is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Full-length amyloid precursor protein (APP) is endocytosed from the cell surface into endosomes where it is cleaved to produce Aβ. Aβ is subsequently released into the brain interstitial fluid (ISF). We hypothesized that synaptic transmission results in more APP endocytosis, thereby increasing Aβ generation and release into the ISF. We found that inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis immediately lowers ISF Aβ levels in vivo. Two distinct methods that increased synaptic transmission resulted in an elevation of ISF Aβ levels. Inhibition of endocytosis, however, prevented the activity-dependent increase in Aβ. We estimate that ∼70% of ISF Aβ arises from endocytosis-associated mechanisms, with the vast majority of this pool also dependent on synaptic activity. These findings have implications for AD pathogenesis and may provide insights into therapeutic intervention.

Olfactory sensory neurons expressing a given odorant receptor converge axons onto a few topographically fixed glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, leading to establishment of the odor map. Here, we report that BIG-2/contactin-4, an axonal glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, is expressed in a subpopulation of mouse olfactory sensory neurons. A mosaic pattern of glomerular arrangement is observed with strongly BIG-2-positive, weakly positive, and negative axon terminals in the olfactory bulb, which is overlapping but not identical with those of Kirrel2 and ephrin-A5. There is a close correlation between the BIG-2 expression level and the odorant receptor choice in individual sensory neurons. In BIG-2-deficient mice, olfactory sensory neurons expressing a given odorant receptor frequently innervate multiple glomeruli at ectopic locations. These results suggest that BIG-2 is one of the axon guidance molecules crucial for the formation and maintenance of functional odor map in the olfactory bulb.

AB  - Summary
The motivation to seek cocaine comes in part from a dysregulation of reward processing manifested in dysphoria, or affective withdrawal. Learning is a critical aspect of drug abuse; however, it remains unclear whether drug-associated cues can elicit the emotional withdrawal symptoms that promote cocaine use. Here we report that a cocaine-associated taste cue elicited a conditioned aversive state that was behaviorally and neurophysiologically quantifiable and predicted subsequent cocaine self-administration behavior. Specifically, brief intraoral infusions of a cocaine-predictive flavored saccharin solution elicited aversive orofacial responses that predicted early-session cocaine taking in rats. The expression of aversive taste reactivity also was associated with a shift in the predominant pattern of electrophysiological activity of nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons from inhibitory to excitatory. The dynamic nature of this conditioned switch in affect and the neural code reveals a mechanism by which cues may exert control over drug self-administration.

Social hierarchies guide behavior in many species, including humans, where status also has an enormous impact on motivation and health. However, little is known about the underlying neural representation of social hierarchies in humans. In the present study, we identify dissociable neural responses to perceived social rank using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in an interactive, simulated social context. In both stable and unstable social hierarchies, viewing a superior individual differentially engaged perceptual-attentional, saliency, and cognitive systems, notably dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In the unstable hierarchy setting, additional regions related to emotional processing (amygdala), social cognition (medial prefrontal cortex), and behavioral readiness were recruited. Furthermore, social hierarchical consequences of performance were neurally dissociable and of comparable salience to monetary reward, providing a neural basis for the high motivational value of status. Our results identify neural mechanisms that may mediate the enormous influence of social status on human behavior and health.

AB  - Summary
Activity-dependent modifications in synapse structure play a key role in synaptic development and plasticity, but the signaling mechanisms involved are poorly understood. We demonstrate that glutamatergic Drosophila neuromuscular junctions undergo rapid changes in synaptic structure and function in response to patterned stimulation. These changes, which depend on transcription and translation, include formation of motile presynaptic filopodia, elaboration of undifferentiated varicosities, and potentiation of spontaneous release frequency. Experiments indicate that a bidirectional Wnt/Wg signaling pathway underlies these changes. Evoked activity induces Wnt1/Wg release from synaptic boutons, which stimulates both a postsynaptic DFz2 nuclear import pathway as well as a presynaptic pathway involving GSK-3β/Shaggy. Our findings suggest that bidirectional Wg signaling operates downstream of synaptic activity to induce modifications in synaptic structure and function. We propose that activation of the postsynaptic Wg pathway is required for the assembly of the postsynaptic apparatus, while activation of the presynaptic Wg pathway regulates cytoskeletal dynamics.

AB  - Summary
Olfactory neurons project their axons to spatially invariant glomeruli in the olfactory bulb, forming an ordered pattern of innervation comprising the olfactory sensory map. A mirror symmetry exists within this map, such that neurons expressing a given receptor typically project to one glomerulus on the medial face and one glomerulus on the lateral face of the bulb. The mechanisms underlying an olfactory neuron's choice to project medially versus laterally remain largely unknown, however. Here we demonstrate that insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling is required for sensory innervation of the lateral olfactory bulb. Mutations that eliminate IGF signaling cause axons destined for targets in the lateral bulb to shift to ectopic sites on the ventral-medial surface. Using primary cultures of olfactory and cerebellar neurons, we further show that IGF is a chemoattractant for axon growth cones. Together these observations reveal a role of IGF signaling in sensory map formation and axon guidance.

AB  - Summary
PICK1 is a calcium-sensing, PDZ domain-containing protein that interacts with GluR2 and GluR3 AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunits and regulates their trafficking. Although PICK1 has been principally implicated in long-term depression (LTD), PICK1 overexpression in CA1 pyramidal neurons causes a CaMK- and PKC-dependent potentiation of AMPAR-mediated transmission and an increase in synaptic GluR2-lacking AMPARs, mechanisms associated with NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP). Here, we directly tested whether PICK1 participates in both hippocampal NMDAR-dependent LTP and LTD. We show that the PICK1 potentiation of AMPAR-mediated transmission is NMDAR dependent and fully occludes LTP. Conversely, blockade of PICK1 PDZ interactions or lack of PICK1 prevents LTP. These observations demonstrate an important role for PICK1 in LTP. In addition, deletion of PICK1 or blockade of PICK1 PDZ binding prevented NMDAR-dependent LTD. Thus, PICK1 plays a critical role in bidirectional NMDAR-dependent long-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.

AB  - Summary
Place-specific firing in the hippocampus is determined by path integration-based spatial representations in the grid-cell network of the medial entorhinal cortex. Output from this network is conveyed directly to CA1 of the hippocampus by projections from principal neurons in layer III, but also indirectly by axons from layer II to the dentate gyrus and CA3. The direct pathway is sufficient for spatial firing in CA1, but it is not known whether similar firing can also be supported by the input from CA3. To test this possibility, we made selective lesions in layer III of medial entorhinal cortex by local infusion of the neurotoxin γ-acetylenic GABA. Firing fields in CA1 became larger and more dispersed after cell loss in layer III, whereas CA3 cells, which receive layer II input, still had sharp firing fields. Thus, the direct projection is necessary for precise spatial firing in the CA1 place cell population.

AB  - Summary
Spinophilin, a dendritic spine-enriched scaffold protein, modulates synaptic transmission via multiple functions mediated by distinct domains of the protein. Here, we show that spinophilin is a key modulator of opiate action. Knockout of the spinophilin gene causes reduced sensitivity to the analgesic effects of morphine and early development of tolerance but a higher degree of physical dependence and increased sensitivity to the rewarding actions of the drug. At the cellular level, spinophilin associates with the μ opioid receptor (MOR) in striatum and modulates MOR signaling and endocytosis. Activation of MOR by opiate agonists such as fentanyl and morphine promotes these events, which feedback to suppress MOR responsiveness. Our findings support a potent physiological role of spinophilin in regulating MOR function and provide a potential new target for the treatment of opiate addiction.

AB  - Summary
The level of synchronization in distributed systems is often controlled by the strength of the interactions between individual elements. In brain circuits the connection strengths between neurons are modified under the influence of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rules. Here we show that when recurrent networks with conduction delays exhibit population bursts, STDP rules exert a strong decoupling force that desynchronizes activity. Conversely, when activity in the network is random, the same rules can have a coupling and synchronizing influence. The presence of these opposing forces promotes the self-organization of spontaneously active neuronal networks to a state at the border between randomness and synchrony. The decoupling force of STDP may be engaged by the synchronous bursts occurring in the hippocampus during slow-wave sleep, leading to the selective erasure of information from hippocampal circuits as memories are established in neocortical areas.

Heretofore, in all examples of cotransmission, each released neurotransmitter acted on a different receptor. Lu, Rubio, and Trussell, however, demonstrate in this issue of Neuron the first instance of cotransmission in which two neurotransmitters act on the same postsynaptic receptor.

AB  - Summary
Operant conditioning is a ubiquitous but mechanistically poorly understood form of associative learning in which an animal learns the consequences of its behavior. Using a single-cell analog of operant conditioning in neuron B51 of Aplysia, we examined second-messenger pathways engaged by activity and reward and how they may provide a biochemical association underlying operant learning. Conditioning was blocked by Rp-cAMP, a peptide inhibitor of PKA, a PKC inhibitor, and by expressing a dominant-negative isoform of Ca2+-dependent PKC (apl-I). Thus, both PKA and PKC were necessary for operant conditioning. Injection of cAMP into B51 mimicked the effects of operant conditioning. Activation of PKC also mimicked conditioning but was dependent on both cAMP and PKA, suggesting that PKC acted at some point upstream of PKA activation. Our results demonstrate how these molecules can interact to mediate operant conditioning in an individual neuron important for the expression of the conditioned behavior.

AB  - Summary
Both reward- and punishment-related stimuli are motivationally salient and attract the attention of animals. However, it remains unclear how motivational salience is processed in the brain. Here, we show that both reward- and punishment-predicting stimuli elicited robust bursting of many noncholinergic basal forebrain (BF) neurons in behaving rats. The same BF neurons also responded with similar bursting to primary reinforcement of both valences. Reinforcement responses were modulated by expectation, with surprising reinforcement eliciting stronger BF bursting. We further demonstrate that BF burst firing predicted successful detection of near-threshold stimuli. Together, our results point to the existence of a salience-encoding system independent of stimulus valence. We propose that the encoding of motivational salience by ensemble bursting of noncholinergic BF neurons may improve behavioral performance by affecting the activity of widespread cortical circuits and therefore represents a novel candidate mechanism for top-down attention.

AB  - Summary
Our understanding of how mammalian sensory circuits are organized and develop has long been hindered by the lack of genetic markers of neurons with discrete functions. Here, we report a transgenic mouse selectively expressing GFP in a complete mosaic of transient OFF-α retinal ganglion cells (tOFF-αRGCs). This enabled us to relate the mosaic spacing, dendritic anatomy, and electrophysiology of these RGCs to their complete map of projections in the brain. We find that tOFF-αRGCs project exclusively to the superior colliculus (SC) and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and are restricted to a specific laminar depth within each of these targets. The axons of tOFF-αRGC are also organized into columns in the SC. Both laminar and columnar specificity develop through axon refinement. Disruption of cholinergic retinal waves prevents the emergence of columnar- but not laminar-specific tOFF-αRGC connections. Our findings reveal that in a genetically identified sensory map, spontaneous activity promotes synaptic specificity by segregating axons arising from RGCs of the same subtype.

AB  - Summary
Although conditioned inhibition of fear (or learned safety) is a learning process critical for preventing chronic stress, a predisposing factor for depression and other psychopathologies, little is known about its functional purposes or molecular mechanisms. To obtain better insight into learned safety, we investigated its behavioral and molecular characteristics and found that it acts as a behavioral antidepressant in two animal models. Learned safety promotes the survival of newborn cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, while its antidepressant effect is abolished in mice with ablated hippocampal neurogenesis. Learned safety also increases the expression of BDNF in the hippocampus and leads to downregulation of genes involved in the dopaminergic and neuropeptidergic but not the serotonergic system in the basolateral amygdala. These data suggest that learned safety is an animal model of a behavioral antidepressant that shares some neuronal hallmarks of pharmacological antidepressants but is mediated by different molecular pathways.

Chronic complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a debilitating pain condition accompanied by autonomic abnormalities. We investigated gray matter morphometry and white matter anisotropy in CRPS patients and matched controls. Patients exhibited a disrupted relationship between white matter anisotropy and whole-brain gray matter volume; gray matter atrophy in a single cluster encompassing right insula, right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), and right nucleus accumbens; and a decrease in fractional anisotropy in the left cingulum-callosal bundle. Reorganization of white matter connectivity in these regions was characterized by branching pattern alterations, as well as increased (VMPFC to insula) and decreased (VMPFC to basal ganglion) connectivity. While regional atrophy differentially related to pain intensity and duration, the strength of connectivity between specific atrophied regions related to anxiety. These abnormalities encompass emotional, autonomic, and pain perception regions, implying that they likely play a critical role in the global clinical picture of CRPS.

When a new perceptual task is learned, plasticity occurs in the brain to mediate improvements in performance with training. How do these changes affect the neural substrates of previously learned tasks? We addressed this question by examining the effect of fine discrimination training on the causal contribution of area MT to coarse depth discrimination. When monkeys are trained to discriminate between two coarse absolute disparities (near versus far) embedded in noise, reversible inactivation of area MT devastates performance. In contrast, after animals are trained to discriminate fine differences in relative disparity, MT inactivation no longer impairs coarse depth discrimination. This effect does not result from changes in the disparity tuning of MT neurons, suggesting plasticity in the flow of disparity signals to decision circuitry. These findings show that the contribution of particular brain area to task performance can change dramatically as a result of learning new tasks.

AB  - Summary
Thiamine monophosphatase (TMPase, also known as fluoride-resistant acid phosphatase) is a classic histochemical marker of small-diameter dorsal root ganglia neurons. The molecular identity of TMPase is currently unknown. We found that TMPase is identical to the transmembrane isoform of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), an enzyme with unknown molecular and physiological functions. We then found that PAP knockout mice have normal acute pain sensitivity but enhanced sensitivity in chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain models. In gain-of-function studies, intraspinal injection of PAP protein has potent antinociceptive, antihyperalgesic, and antiallodynic effects that last longer than the opioid analgesic morphine. PAP suppresses pain by functioning as an ecto-5′-nucleotidase. Specifically, PAP dephosphorylates extracellular adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to adenosine and activates A1-adenosine receptors in dorsal spinal cord. Our studies reveal molecular and physiological functions for PAP in purine nucleotide metabolism and nociception and suggest a novel use for PAP in the treatment of chronic pain.

Although pr is a fundamental parameter in defining synaptic efficacy, it is not uniform across all synapses, and the mechanisms by which a given synapse sets its basal release probability are unknown. By measuring pr at single presynaptic terminals in connected pairs of hippocampal neurons, we show that neighboring synapses on the same dendritic branch have very similar release probabilities, and pr is negatively correlated with the number of synapses on the branch. Increasing dendritic depolarization elicits a homeostatic decrease in pr, and equalizing activity in the dendrite significantly reduces its variability. Our results indicate that local dendritic activity is the major determinant of basal release probability, and we suggest that this feedback regulation might be required to maintain synapses in their operational range.

AB  - Summary
Tolerance represents a critical component of addiction. The large-conductance calcium- and voltage-activated potassium channel (BK) is a well-established alcohol target, and an important element in behavioral and molecular alcohol tolerance. We tested whether microRNA, a newly discovered class of gene expression regulators, plays a role in the development of tolerance. We show that in adult mammalian brain, alcohol upregulates microRNA miR-9 and mediates posttranscriptional reorganization in BK mRNA splice variants by miR-9-dependent destabilization of BK mRNAs containing 3′UTRs with a miR-9 Recognition Element (MRE). Different splice variants encode BK isoforms with different alcohol sensitivities. Computational modeling indicates that this miR-9-dependent mechanism contributes to alcohol tolerance. Moreover, this mechanism can be extended to include regulation of additional miR-9 targets relevant to alcohol abuse. Our results describe a mechanism of multiplex regulation of stability of alternatively spliced mRNA by microRNA in drug adaptation and neuronal plasticity.

AB  - Drug addiction is a chronically relapsing disorder characterized by compulsion to seek and take drugs and has been linked to dysregulation of brain regions that mediate reward and stress. Activation of brain stress systems is hypothesized to be key to the negative emotional state produced by dependence that drives drug seeking through negative reinforcement mechanisms. This review explores the role of brain stress systems (corticotropin-releasing factor, norepinephrine, orexin [hypocretin], vasopressin, dynorphin) and brain antistress systems (neuropeptide Y, nociceptin [orphanin FQ]) in drug dependence, with emphasis on the neuropharmacological function of extrahypothalamic systems in the extended amygdala. The brain stress and antistress systems may play a key role in the transition to and maintenance of drug dependence once initiated. Understanding the role of brain stress and antistress systems in addiction provides novel targets for treatment and prevention of addiction and insights into the organization and function of basic brain emotional circuitry.

AB  - Single-molecule approaches give access to the full distribution of molecule behaviors and overcome the averaging intrinsic to bulk measurement methods. They allow access to complex processes where a given molecule can have heterogeneous properties over time. Recent developments in single-molecule imaging technologies have been followed by their wide application in cellular biology and are leading to the unraveling of new mechanisms related to molecular movements. They are shaping new concepts in the dynamic equilibria of complex biological macromolecular assemblies such as synapses. These advances were made possible thanks to improvements in visualization approaches combined with new strategies to label proteins with nanoprobes. In this primer, we will review the different approaches used to track single molecules in live neurons, compare them to bulk measurements, and discuss the different concepts that have emerged from their application to synaptic biology.

AB  - Summary
Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is stimulated by chronic administration of antidepressants (ADs) and by voluntary exercise. Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the dentate gyrus (DG) that are capable of continuous proliferation and neuronal differentiation are the source of such structural plasticity. Here we report that mice lacking the receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB in hippocampal NPCs have impaired proliferation and neurogenesis. When exposed to chronic ADs or wheel-running, no increase in proliferation or neurogenesis is observed. Ablation of TrkB also renders these mice behaviorally insensitive to antidepressive treatment in depression- and anxiety-like paradigms. In contrast, mice lacking TrkB only in differentiated DG neurons display typical neurogenesis and respond normally to chronic ADs. Thus, our data establish an essential cell-autonomous role for TrkB in regulating hippocampal neurogenesis and behavioral sensitivity to antidepressive treatments, and support the notion that impairment of the neurogenic niche is an etiological factor for refractory responses to an antidepressive regimen.

AB  - Summary
Responses of multisensory neurons to combinations of sensory cues are generally enhanced or depressed relative to single cues presented alone, but the rules that govern these interactions have remained unclear. We examined integration of visual and vestibular self-motion cues in macaque area MSTd in response to unimodal as well as congruent and conflicting bimodal stimuli in order to evaluate hypothetical combination rules employed by multisensory neurons. Bimodal responses were well fit by weighted linear sums of unimodal responses, with weights typically less than one (subadditive). Surprisingly, our results indicate that weights change with the relative reliabilities of the two cues: visual weights decrease and vestibular weights increase when visual stimuli are degraded. Moreover, both modulation depth and neuronal discrimination thresholds improve for matched bimodal compared to unimodal stimuli, which might allow for increased neural sensitivity during multisensory stimulation. These findings establish important new constraints for neural models of cue integration.

AB  - Summary
The formation of locomotor circuits depends on the spatially organized generation of motor columns that innervate distinct muscle and autonomic nervous system targets along the body axis. Within each spinal segment, multiple motor neuron classes arise from a common progenitor population; however, the mechanisms underlying their diversification remain poorly understood. Here, we show that the Forkhead domain transcription factor Foxp1 plays a critical role in defining the columnar identity of motor neurons at each axial position. Using genetic manipulations, we demonstrate that Foxp1 establishes the pattern of LIM-HD protein expression and accordingly organizes motor axon projections, their connectivity with peripheral targets, and the establishment of motor pools. These functions of Foxp1 act in accordance with the rostrocaudal pattern provided by Hox proteins along the length of the spinal cord, suggesting a model by which motor neuron diversity is achieved through the coordinated actions of Foxp1 and Hox proteins.

AB  - Summary
Oscillatory neuronal synchronization, within and between cortical areas, may mediate the selection of attended visual stimuli. However, it remains unclear at and between which processing stages visuospatial attention modulates oscillatory synchronization in the human brain. We thus combined magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a spatially cued motion discrimination task with source-reconstruction techniques and characterized attentional effects on neuronal synchronization across key stages of the human dorsal visual pathway. We found that visuospatial attention modulated oscillatory synchronization between visual, parietal, and prefrontal cortex in a spatially selective fashion. Furthermore, synchronized activity within these stages was selectively modulated by attention, but with markedly distinct spectral signatures and stimulus dependence between regions. Our data indicate that regionally specific oscillatory synchronization at most stages of the human dorsal visual pathway may enhance the processing of attended visual stimuli and suggest that attentional selection is mediated by frequency-specific synchronization between prefrontal, parietal, and early visual cortex.

AB  - Summary
Neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is broadly expressed in the brain and associated with synaptic plasticity through NMDAR-mediated calcium influx. However, its physiological activation and the mechanisms by which nitric oxide (NO) influences synaptic transmission have proved elusive. Here, we exploit the unique input-specificity of the calyx of Held to characterize NO modulation at this glutamatergic synapse in the auditory pathway. NO is generated in an activity-dependent manner by MNTB principal neurons receiving a calyceal synaptic input. It acts in the target neuron and adjacent inactive neurons to modulate excitability and synaptic efficacy, inhibiting postsynaptic Kv3 potassium currents (via phosphorylation), reducing EPSCs and so increasing action potential duration and reducing transmission fidelity. We conclude that NO serves as a volume transmitter and slow dynamic modulator, integrating spontaneous and evoked neuronal firing, thereby providing an index of global activity and regulating information transmission across a population of active and inactive neurons.

AB  - Summary
α6-containing (α6∗) nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) are selectively expressed in dopamine (DA) neurons and participate in cholinergic transmission. We generated and studied mice with gain-of-function α6∗ nAChRs, which isolate and amplify cholinergic control of DA transmission. In contrast to gene knockouts or pharmacological blockers, which show necessity, we show that activating α6∗ nAChRs and DA neurons is sufficient to cause locomotor hyperactivity. α6L9′S mice are hyperactive in their home cage and fail to habituate to a novel environment. Selective activation of α6∗ nAChRs with low doses of nicotine, by stimulating DA but not GABA neurons, exaggerates these phenotypes and produces a hyperdopaminergic state in vivo. Experiments with additional nicotinic drugs show that altering agonist efficacy at α6∗ provides fine tuning of DA release and locomotor responses. α6∗-specific agonists or antagonists may, by targeting endogenous cholinergic mechanisms in midbrain or striatum, provide a method for manipulating DA transmission in neural disorders.

AB  - Summary
Animals can flexibly change their behavior in response to a particular sensory stimulus; the mapping between sensory and motor representations in the brain must therefore be flexible as well. Changes in the correlated firing of pairs of neurons may provide a metric of changes in functional circuitry during behavior. We studied dynamic changes in functional circuitry by analyzing the noise correlations of simultaneously recorded MT neurons in two behavioral contexts: one that promotes cooperative interactions between the two neurons and another that promotes competitive interactions. We found that identical visual stimuli give rise to differences in noise correlation in the two contexts, suggesting that MT neurons receive inputs of central origin whose strength changes with the task structure. The data are consistent with a mixed feature-based attentional strategy model in which the animal sometimes alternates attention between opposite directions of motion and sometimes attends to the two directions simultaneously.

In the developing mouse retina, multipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) give rise to specific retinal cell types at different times, but the molecular mechanisms regulating how RPCs change over time remain unclear. In the Drosophila neuroblast lineage, the zinc finger transcription factor Hunchback (Hb) is both necessary and sufficient to specify early-born neuronal identity. We show here that Ikaros, a mouse ortholog of Hb, is expressed in all early embryonic RPCs, which then give rise to Ikaros-negative RPCs at later stages in the lineage. Remarkably, misexpression of Ikaros in late RPCs is sufficient to confer competence to generate early-born neurons. Conversely, Ikaros mutant mice have reduced numbers of early-born cell types, whereas late-born cell types are not affected. These results suggest a model in which Ikaros expression is both necessary and sufficient to confer early temporal competence to RPCs and raise the possibility that a similar strategy might be used to control the sequential order of cell birth in other parts of the nervous system.

AB  - Summary
The initiation and coordination of activity in limb muscles are the main functions of neural circuits that control locomotion. Commissural neurons connect locomotor circuits on the two sides of the spinal cord, and represent the known neural substrate for left-right coordination. Here we demonstrate that a group of ipsilateral interneurons, V2a interneurons, plays an essential role in the control of left-right alternation. In the absence of V2a interneurons, the spinal cord fails to exhibit consistent left–right alternation. Locomotor burst activity shows increased variability, but flexor-extensor coordination is unaffected. Anatomical tracing studies reveal a direct excitatory input of V2a interneurons onto commissural interneurons, including a set of molecularly defined V0 neurons that drive left-right alternation. Our findings imply that the neural substrate for left-right coordination consists of at least two components; commissural neurons and a class of ipsilateral interneurons that activate commissural pathways.

AB  - Summary
The structural effects of cocaine on neural systems mediating cognition and motivation are not well known. By comparing the thickness of neocortical and paralimbic brain regions between cocaine-dependent and matched control subjects, we found that four of 18 a priori regions involved with executive regulation of reward and attention were significantly thinner in addicts. Correlations were significant between thinner prefrontal cortex and reduced keypresses during judgment and decision making of relative preference in addicts, suggesting one basis for restricted behavioral repertoires in drug dependence. Reduced effortful attention performance in addicts also correlated with thinner paralimbic cortices. Some thickness differences in addicts were correlated with cocaine use independent of nicotine and alcohol, but addicts also showed diminished thickness heterogeneity and altered hemispheric thickness asymmetry. These observations suggest that brain structure abnormalities in addicts are related in part to drug use and in part to predisposition toward addiction.

AB  - Summary
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the deposition of senile plaques and progressive dementia. The molecular mechanisms that couple plaque deposition to neural system failure, however, are unknown. Using transgenic mouse models of AD together with multiphoton imaging, we measured neuronal calcium in individual neurites and spines in vivo using the genetically encoded calcium indicator Yellow Cameleon 3.6. Quantitative imaging revealed elevated [Ca2+]i (calcium overload) in ∼20% of neurites in APP mice with cortical plaques, compared to less than 5% in wild-type mice, PS1 mutant mice, or young APP mice (animals without cortical plaques). Calcium overload depended on the existence and proximity to plaques. The downstream consequences included the loss of spinodendritic calcium compartmentalization (critical for synaptic integration) and a distortion of neuritic morphologies mediated, in part, by the phosphatase calcineurin. Together, these data demonstrate that senile plaques impair neuritic calcium homeostasis in vivo and result in the structural and functional disruption of neuronal networks.

AB  - Summary
Cocaine strengthens excitatory synapses onto midbrain dopamine neurons through the synaptic delivery of GluR1-containing AMPA receptors. This cocaine-evoked plasticity depends on NMDA receptor activation, but its behavioral significance in the context of addiction remains elusive. Here, we generated mice lacking the GluR1, GluR2, or NR1 receptor subunits selectively in dopamine neurons. We report that in midbrain slices of cocaine-treated mice, synaptic transmission was no longer strengthened when GluR1 or NR1 was abolished, while in the respective mice the drug still induced normal conditioned place preference and locomotor sensitization. In contrast, extinction of drug-seeking behavior was absent in mice lacking GluR1, while in the NR1 mutant mice reinstatement was abolished. In conclusion, cocaine-evoked synaptic plasticity does not mediate concurrent short-term behavioral effects of the drug but may initiate adaptive changes eventually leading to the persistence of drug-seeking behavior.

AB  - Summary
Membrane proteins function in a polarized ionic environment with sodium-rich extracellular and potassium-rich intracellular solutions. Glutamate receptors that mediate excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain show unusual sensitivity to external ions, resulting in an apparent requirement for sodium in order for glutamate to activate kainate receptors. Here, we solve the structure of the Na+-binding sites and determine the mechanism by which allosteric anions and cations regulate ligand-binding dimer stability, and hence the rate of desensitization and receptor availability for gating by glutamate. We establish a stoichiometry for binding of 2 Na+ to 1 Cl− and show that allosteric anions and cations bind at physically discrete sites with strong electric fields, that the binding sites are not saturated in CSF, and that the requirement of kainate receptors for Na+ occurs simply because other cations bind with lower affinity and have lower efficacy compared to Na+.

AB  - Summary
Small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels are widely expressed in neuronal tissues where they underlie postspike hyperpolarizations, regulate spike-frequency adaptation, and shape synaptic responses. SK channels constitutively interact with calmodulin (CaM), which serves as Ca2+ sensor, and with protein kinase CK2 and protein phosphatase 2A, which modulate their Ca2+ gating. By recording coupled activities of Ca2+ and SK2 channels, we showed that SK2 channels can be inhibited by neurotransmitters independently of changes in the activity of the priming Ca2+ channels. This inhibition involves SK2-associated CK2 and results from a 3-fold reduction in the Ca2+ sensitivity of channel gating. CK2 phosphorylated SK2-bound CaM but not KCNQ2-bound CaM, thereby selectively regulating SK2 channels. We extended these observations to sensory neurons by showing that noradrenaline inhibits SK current and increases neuronal excitability in a CK2-dependent fashion. Hence, neurotransmitter-initiated signaling cascades can dynamically regulate Ca2+ sensitivity of SK channels and directly influence somatic excitability.

AB  - Summary
The cerebellum controls complex, coordinated, and rapid movements, a function requiring precise timing abilities. However, the network mechanisms that underlie the temporal organization of activity in the cerebellum are largely unexplored, because in vivo recordings have usually targeted single units. Here, we use tetrode and multisite recordings to demonstrate that Purkinje cell activity is synchronized by a high-frequency (∼200 Hz) population oscillation. We combine pharmacological experiments and modeling to show how the recurrent inhibitory connections between Purkinje cells are sufficient to generate these oscillations. A key feature of these oscillations is a fixed population frequency that is independent of the firing rates of the individual cells. Convergence in the deep cerebellar nuclei of Purkinje cell activity, synchronized by these oscillations, likely organizes temporally the cerebellar output.

AB  - Summary
Synaptic homeostasis, induced by chronic changes in neuronal activity, is well studied in cultured neurons, but not in more physiological networks where distinct synaptic circuits are preserved. We characterized inactivity-induced adaptations at three sets of excitatory synapses in tetrodotoxin-treated organotypic hippocampal cultures. The adaptation to inactivity was strikingly synapse specific. Hippocampal throughput synapses (dentate-to-CA3 and CA3-to-CA1) were upregulated, conforming to homeostatic gain control in order to avoid extreme limits of neuronal firing. However, chronic inactivity decreased mEPSC frequency at CA3-to-CA3 synapses, which were isolated pharmacologically or surgically. This downregulation of recurrent synapses was opposite to that expected for conventional homeostasis, in apparent conflict with typical gain control. However, such changes contributed to an inactivity-induced shortening of reverberatory bursts generated by feedback excitation among CA3 pyramids, safeguarding the network from possible runaway excitation. Thus, synapse-specific adaptations of synaptic weight not only contributed to homeostatic gain control, but also dampened epileptogenic network activity.

AB  - Summary
Trust and betrayal of trust are ubiquitous in human societies. Recent behavioral evidence shows that the neuropeptide oxytocin increases trust among humans, thus offering a unique chance of gaining a deeper understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying trust and the adaptation to breach of trust. We examined the neural circuitry of trusting behavior by combining the intranasal, double-blind, administration of oxytocin with fMRI. We find that subjects in the oxytocin group show no change in their trusting behavior after they learned that their trust had been breached several times while subjects receiving placebo decrease their trust. This difference in trust adaptation is associated with a specific reduction in activation in the amygdala, the midbrain regions, and the dorsal striatum in subjects receiving oxytocin, suggesting that neural systems mediating fear processing (amygdala and midbrain regions) and behavioral adaptations to feedback information (dorsal striatum) modulate oxytocin's effect on trust. These findings may help to develop deeper insights into mental disorders such as social phobia and autism, which are characterized by persistent fear or avoidance of social interactions.

AB  - Summary
Apolipoprotein E is associated with age-related risk for Alzheimer's disease and plays critical roles in Aβ homeostasis. We report that ApoE plays a role in facilitating the proteolytic clearance of soluble Aβ from the brain. The endolytic degradation of Aβ peptides within microglia by neprilysin and related enzymes is dramatically enhanced by ApoE. Similarly, Aβ degradation extracellularly by insulin-degrading enzyme is facilitated by ApoE. The capacity of ApoE to promote Aβ degradation is dependent upon the ApoE isoform and its lipidation status. The enhanced expression of lipidated ApoE, through the activation of liver X receptors, stimulates Aβ degradation. Indeed, aged Tg2576 mice treated with the LXR agonist GW3965 exhibited a dramatic reduction in brain Aβ load. GW3965 treatment also reversed contextual memory deficits. These data demonstrate a mechanism through which ApoE facilitates the clearance of Aβ from the brain and suggest that LXR agonists may represent a novel therapy for AD.

AB  - Summary
At synapses, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) provide the molecular framework for coordinating signaling events across the synaptic cleft. Among synaptic CAMs, the integrins, receptors for extracellular matrix proteins and counterreceptors on adjacent cells, are implicated in synapse maturation and plasticity and memory formation. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of integrin action at central synapses. Here, we report that postsynaptic β3 integrins control synaptic strength by regulating AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in a subunit-specific manner. Pharmacological perturbation targeting β3 integrins promotes endocytosis of GluR2-containing AMPARs via Rap1 signaling, and expression of β3 integrins produces robust changes in the abundance and composition of synaptic AMPARs without affecting dendritic spine structure. Importantly, homeostatic synaptic scaling induced by activity deprivation elevates surface expression of β3 integrins, and in turn, β3 integrins are required for synaptic scaling. Our findings demonstrate a key role for integrins in the feedback regulation of excitatory synaptic strength.

AB  - Summary
TRP cation channels function as cellular sensors in uni- and multicellular eukaryotes. Despite intensive study, the mechanisms of TRP channel activation by chemical or physical stimuli remain poorly understood. To identify amino acid residues crucial for TRP channel gating, we developed an unbiased, high-throughput genetic screen in yeast that uncovered rare, constitutively active mutants of the capsaicin receptor, TRPV1. We show that mutations within the pore helix domain dramatically increase basal channel activity and responsiveness to chemical and thermal stimuli. Mutation of corresponding residues within two related TRPV channels leads to comparable effects on their activation properties. Our data suggest that conformational changes in the outer pore region are critical for determining the balance between open and closed states, providing evidence for a general role for this domain in TRP channel activation.

AB  - Summary
In the spinal cord, most inhibitory synapses have a mixed glycine-GABA phenotype. Using a pharmacological approach, we report an NMDAR activity-dependent regulation of the mobility of GlyRs but not GABAARs at inhibitory synapses in cultured rat spinal cord neurons. The NMDAR-induced decrease in GlyR lateral diffusion was correlated with an increase in receptor cluster number and glycinergic mIPSC amplitude. Changes in GlyR diffusion properties occurred rapidly and before the changes in the number of synaptic receptors. Regulation of synaptic GlyR content occurred without change in the amount of gephyrin. Moreover, NMDAR-dependent regulation of GlyR lateral diffusion required calcium influx and calcium release from stores. Therefore, excitation may increase GlyR levels at synapses by a calcium-mediated increase in postsynaptic GlyR trapping involving regulation of receptor-scaffold interactions. This provides a mechanism for a rapid homeostatic regulation of the inhibitory glycinergic component at mixed glycine-GABA synapses in response to increased NMDA excitatory transmission.

AB  - Summary
In the mammalian central nervous system, slow synaptic excitation involves the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). It has been proposed that C1-type transient receptor potential (TRPC1) channels underlie this synaptic excitation, but our analysis of TRPC1-deficient mice does not support this hypothesis. Here, we show unambiguously that it is TRPC3 that is needed for mGluR-dependent synaptic signaling in mouse cerebellar Purkinje cells. TRPC3 is the most abundantly expressed TRPC subunit in Purkinje cells. In mutant mice lacking TRPC3, both slow synaptic potentials and mGluR-mediated inward currents are completely absent, while the synaptically mediated Ca2+ release signals from intracellular stores are unchanged. Importantly, TRPC3 knockout mice exhibit an impaired walking behavior. Taken together, our results establish TRPC3 as a new type of postsynaptic channel that mediates mGluR-dependent synaptic transmission in cerebellar Purkinje cells and is crucial for motor coordination.

AB  - Among diverse factors regulating excitatory synaptic transmission, the abundance of postsynaptic glutamate receptors figures prominently in molecular memory and learning-related synaptic plasticity. To allow for both long-term maintenance of synaptic transmission and acute changes in synaptic strength, the relative rates of glutamate receptor insertion and removal must be tightly regulated. Interactions with scaffolding proteins control the targeting and signaling properties of glutamate receptors within the postsynaptic membrane. In addition, extrasynaptic receptor populations control the equilibrium of receptor exchange at synapses and activate distinct signaling pathways involved in plasticity. Here, we review recent findings that have shaped our current understanding of receptor mobility between synaptic and extrasynaptic compartments at glutamatergic synapses, focusing on AMPA and NMDA receptors. We also examine the cooperative relationship between intracellular trafficking and surface diffusion of glutamate receptors that underlies the expression of learning-related synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Summary
Intracellular recordings of neuronal membrane potential are a central tool in neurophysiology. In many situations, especially in vivo, the traditional limitation of such recordings is the high electrode resistance and capacitance, which may cause significant measurement errors during current injection. We introduce a computer-aided technique, Active Electrode Compensation (AEC), based on a digital model of the electrode interfaced in real time with the electrophysiological setup. The characteristics of this model are first estimated using white noise current injection. The electrode and membrane contribution are digitally separated, and the recording is then made by online subtraction of the electrode contribution. Tests performed in vitro and in vivo demonstrate that AEC enables high-frequency recordings in demanding conditions, such as injection of conductance noise in dynamic-clamp mode, not feasible with a single high-resistance electrode until now. AEC should be particularly useful to characterize fast neuronal phenomena intracellularly in vivo.

The desire to seek new and unfamiliar experiences is a fundamental behavioral tendency in humans and other species. In economic decision making, novelty seeking is often rational, insofar as uncertain options may prove valuable and advantageous in the long run. Here, we show that, even when the degree of perceptual familiarity of an option is unrelated to choice outcome, novelty nevertheless drives choice behavior. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we show that this behavior is specifically associated with striatal activity, in a manner consistent with computational accounts of decision making under uncertainty. Furthermore, this activity predicts interindividual differences in susceptibility to novelty. These data indicate that the brain uses perceptual novelty to approximate choice uncertainty in decision making, which in certain contexts gives rise to a newly identified and quantifiable source of human irrationality.

AB  - Several years ago, the discovery of a highly tumorigenic subpopulation of stem-like cells embedded within fresh surgical isolates of malignant gliomas lent support to a new paradigm in cancer biology—the cancer stem cell hypothesis. At the same time, these “glioma stem cells” seemed to resolve a long-standing conundrum on the cell of origin for primary cancers of the brain. However, central tenets of the cancer stem cell hypothesis have recently been challenged, and the cellular origins of stem-like cells within malignant glioma are still contended. Here, we summarize the issues that are still in play with respect to the cancer stem cell hypothesis, and we revisit the developmental origins of malignant glioma. Do glioma stem cells arise from developmentally stalled neural progenitors or from dedifferentiated astrocytes? Five separate predictions of a neural progenitor cell of origin are put to the test.

AB  - The roles that astrocytes play in the evolution of abnormal network excitability in chronic neurological disorders involving brain injury, such as acquired epilepsy, are receiving renewed attention due to improved understanding of the molecular events underpinning the physiological functions of astrocytes. In epileptic tissue, evidence is pointing to enhanced chemical signaling and disrupted linkage between water and potassium balance by reactive astrocytes, which together conspire to enhance local synchrony in hippocampal microcircuits. Reactive astrocytes in epileptic tissue both promote and oppose seizure development through a variety of specific mechanisms; the new findings suggest several novel astrocyte-related targets for drug development.

AB  - Summary
Neuromodulators such as acetylcholine, serotonin, and noradrenaline are powerful regulators of neocortical activity. Although it is well established that cortical inhibition is the target of these modulations, little is known about their effects on GABA release from specific interneuron types. This knowledge is necessary to gain a mechanistic understanding of the actions of neuromodulators because different interneuron classes control specific aspects of excitatory cell function. Here, we report that GABA release from fast-spiking (FS) cells, the most prevalent interneuron subtype in neocortex, is robustly inhibited following activation of muscarinic, serotonin, adenosine, and GABAB receptors—an effect that regulates FS cell control of excitatory neuron firing. The potent muscarinic inhibition of GABA release from FS cells suppresses thalamocortical feedforward inhibition. This is supplemented by the muscarinic-mediated depolarization of thalamo-recipient excitatory neurons and the nicotinic enhancement of thalamic input onto these neurons to promote thalamocortical excitation.

AB  - Summary
We investigate the logic by which sensory input is translated into behavioral output. First we provide a functional analysis of the entire odor receptor repertoire of an olfactory system. We construct tuning curves for the 21 functional odor receptors of the Drosophila larva and show that they sharpen at lower odor doses. We construct a 21-dimensional odor space from the responses of the receptors and find that the distance between two odors correlates with the extent to which one odor masks the other. Mutational analysis shows that different receptors mediate the responses to different concentrations of an odorant. The summed response of the entire receptor repertoire correlates with the strength of the behavioral response. The activity of a small number of receptors is a surprisingly powerful predictor of behavior. Odors that inhibit more receptors are more likely to be repellents. Odor space is largely conserved between two dissimilar olfactory systems.

AB  - Summary
Olfactory sensory neurons expressing a common receptor gene converge onto one or a few glomeruli with stereotyped positions within the mouse main olfactory bulb (MOB), producing a map of ∼1800 olfactory columns representing ∼1000 odorant receptors. Here, we report that this precise olfactory map is maintained over several synapses that ultimately cross MOB hemispheres to link bilateral isofunctional olfactory columns. Focal injection of tracer into genetically identified glomeruli revealed an exquisite topography that involves a bilateral connection via the anterior olfactory nucleus pars externa (AONpE) that links isofunctional olfactory columns in the contralateral MOB. Physiological and behavioral assays revealed an important role for the AONpE in bilateral exchange of odorant-specific information. These results indicate that the interbulbar link through the AONpE integrates bilateral olfactory sensory maps and exchanges olfactory information, positioning it as a unique model system for studying interhemispheric connections.

AB  - Summary
The “endowment effect” refers to the tendency to place greater value on items that one owns—an anomaly that violates the reference-independence assumption of rational choice theories. We investigated neural antecedents of the endowment effect in an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. During scanning, 24 subjects considered six products paired with 18 different prices under buying, choosing, or selling conditions. Subjects showed greater nucleus accumbens (NAcc) activation for preferred products across buy and sell conditions combined, but greater mesial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) activation in response to low prices when buying versus selling. During selling, right insular activation for preferred products predicted individual differences in susceptibility to the endowment effect. These findings are consistent with a reference-dependent account in which ownership increases value by enhancing the salience of the possible loss of preferred products.

AB  - Cerebellar high-frequency oscillations have been observed for many decades, but their underlying mechanisms have remained enigmatic. In this issue of Neuron, two papers indicate that specific intrinsic mechanisms in the cerebellar cortex contribute to the generation of these oscillations. Middleton et al. show that GABAA receptor activation and nonchemical transmission are required for nicotine-dependent oscillations at 30–80 Hz and 80–160 Hz, respectively, while de Solages et al. provide evidence that recurrent inhibition by Purkinje cells is essential for oscillations around 200 Hz.

AB  - Summary
Peripheral sensory neurons respond to axon injury by activating an importin-dependent retrograde signaling mechanism. How is this mechanism regulated? Here, we show that Ran GTPase and its associated effectors RanBP1 and RanGAP regulate the formation of importin signaling complexes in injured axons. A gradient of nuclear RanGTP versus cytoplasmic RanGDP is thought to be fundamental for the organization of eukaryotic cells. Surprisingly, we find RanGTP in sciatic nerve axoplasm, distant from neuronal cell bodies and nuclei, and in association with dynein and importin-α. Following injury, localized translation of RanBP1 stimulates RanGTP dissociation from importins and subsequent hydrolysis, thereby allowing binding of newly synthesized importin-β to importin-α and dynein. Perturbation of RanGTP hydrolysis or RanBP1 blockade at axonal injury sites reduces the neuronal conditioning lesion response. Thus, neurons employ localized mechanisms of Ran regulation to control retrograde injury signaling in peripheral nerve.

AB  - Summary
Rapid, experience-dependent plasticity in developing visual cortex is thought to be competitive. After monocular visual deprivation, the reduction in response of binocular neurons to one eye is matched by a corresponding increase to the other. Chronic optical imaging in mice deficient in TNFα reveals the normal initial loss of deprived-eye responses, but the subsequent increase in response to the open eye is absent. This mutation also blocks homeostatic synaptic scaling of mEPSCs in visual cortex in vitro, without affecting LTP. In monocular cortex, thought not to be subject to competition, responses in TNFα mutants are as reduced as in the binocular zone. Pharmacological inhibition of endogenous TNFα in wild-type mice phenocopies the knockout. These findings suggest that experience-dependent competition in developing visual cortex is the outcome of two distinct, noncompetitive processes, a loss of deprived-eye responses followed by an apparently homeostatic increase in responses dependent on TNFα signaling.

AB  - Summary
The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein that controls translational efficiency and regulates synaptic plasticity. Here, we report that FMRP is involved in dopamine (DA) modulation of synaptic potentiation. AMPA glutamate receptor subtype 1 (GluR1) surface expression and phosphorylation in response to D1 receptor stimulation were reduced in cultured Fmr1−/− prefrontal cortex (PFC) neurons. Furthermore, D1 receptor signaling was impaired, accompanied by D1 receptor hyperphosphorylation at serine sites and subcellular redistribution of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) in both PFC and striatum of Fmr1−/− mice. FMRP interacted with GRK2, and pharmacological inhibition of GRK2 rescued D1 receptor signaling in Fmr1−/− neurons. Finally, D1 receptor agonist partially rescued hyperactivity and enhanced the motor function of Fmr1−/− mice. Our study has identified FMRP as a key messenger for DA modulation in the forebrain and may provide insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying fragile X syndrome.

AB  - Summary
How the brain uses success and failure to optimize future decisions is a long-standing question in neuroscience. One computational solution involves updating the values of context-action associations in proportion to a reward prediction error. Previous evidence suggests that such computations are expressed in the striatum and, as they are cognitively impenetrable, represent an unconscious learning mechanism. Here, we formally test this by studying instrumental conditioning in a situation where we masked contextual cues, such that they were not consciously perceived. Behavioral data showed that subjects nonetheless developed a significant propensity to choose cues associated with monetary rewards relative to punishments. Functional neuroimaging revealed that during conditioning cue values and prediction errors, generated from a computational model, both correlated with activity in ventral striatum. We conclude that, even without conscious processing of contextual cues, our brain can learn their reward value and use them to provide a bias on decision making.

AB  - In modern medicine, the placebo response or placebo effect has often been regarded as a nuisance in basic research and particularly in clinical research. The latest scientific evidence has demonstrated, however, that the placebo effect and the nocebo effect, the negative effects of placebo, stem from highly active processes in the brain that are mediated by psychological mechanisms such as expectation and conditioning. These processes have been described in some detail for many diseases and treatments, and we now know that they can represent both strength and vulnerability in the course of a disease as well as in the response to a therapy. However, recent research and current knowledge raise several issues that we shall address in this review. We will discuss current neurobiological models like expectation-induced activation of the brain reward circuitry, Pavlovian conditioning, and anxiety mechanisms of the nocebo response. We will further explore the nature of the placebo responses in clinical trials and address major questions for future research such as the relationship between expectations and conditioning in placebo effects, the existence of a consistent brain network for all placebo effects, the role of gender in placebo effects, and the impact of getting drug-like effects without drugs.

AB  - Summary
Perceptual inference is biased by foreknowledge about what is probable or possible. How prior expectations are neurally represented during visual perception, however, remains unknown. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain activity in humans judging simple visual stimuli. Perceptual decisions were either biased in favor of a single alternative (A/∼A decisions) or taken without bias toward either choice (A/B decisions). Extrastriate and anterior temporal lobe regions were more active during A/∼A than A/B decisions, suggesting multiple representations of prior expectations within the visual hierarchy. Forward connectivity was increased when expected and observed perception diverged (“prediction error” signals), whereas prior expectations fed backward from higher to lower regions. Finally, the coincidence between expected and observed perception activated orbital prefrontal regions, perhaps reflecting the reinforcement of prior expectations. These data support computational and quantitative models proposing that a visual percept emerges from converging bottom-up and top-down signals.

AB  - Summary
Fluctuating neurosteroid levels over the ovarian cycle modulate neuronal excitability through effects on GABAA receptors (GABAARs). The large increase in progesterone-derived neurosteroids during pregnancy and their precipitous decline at parturition may have considerable effects on GABAARs during pregnancy and postpartum. Here we show a significant decrease in tonic and phasic inhibitions in pregnant mice, mediated by a downregulation of GABAAR δ and γ2 subunits, respectively, which rebounds immediately postpartum. Mice which do not exhibit GABAAR δ subunit regulation throughout pregnancy (Gabrd+/− and Gabrd−/−) exhibit depression-like and abnormal maternal behaviors, resulting in reduced pup survival. These abnormal postpartum behaviors were ameliorated in Gabrd+/− mice by a GABAAR δ-subunit-selective agonist, THIP. We suggest that Gabrd+/− and Gabrd−/− mice constitute a mouse model of postpartum depression that may be useful for evaluating potential therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Summary
Repeated exposure to cocaine causes sensitized behavioral responses and increased dendritic spines on medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We find that cocaine regulates myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcription factors to control these two processes in vivo. Cocaine suppresses striatal MEF2 activity in part through a mechanism involving cAMP, the regulator of calmodulin signaling (RCS), and calcineurin. We show that reducing MEF2 activity in the NAc in vivo is required for the cocaine-induced increases in dendritic spine density. Surprisingly, we find that increasing MEF2 activity in the NAc, which blocks the cocaine-induced increase in dendritic spine density, enhances sensitized behavioral responses to cocaine. Together, our findings implicate MEF2 as a key regulator of structural synapse plasticity and sensitized responses to cocaine and suggest that reducing MEF2 activity (and increasing spine density) in NAc may be a compensatory mechanism to limit long-lasting maladaptive behavioral responses to cocaine.

AB  - Summary
The organization of postthalamic auditory areas remains unclear in many respects. Using a stimulus based on properties of natural sounds, we mapped spectro-temporal receptive fields (STRFs) of neurons in the primary auditory area field L of unanesthetized zebra finches. Cells were sensitive to only a subset of possible acoustic features: nearly all neurons were narrowly tuned along the spectral dimension, the temporal dimension, or both; broadly tuned and strongly orientation-sensitive cells were rare. At high stimulus intensities, neurons were sensitive to differences in sound energy along their preferred dimension, while at lower intensities, neurons behaved more like simple detectors. Finally, we found a systematic relationship between neurons' STRFs, their electrophysiological properties, and their location in field L input or output layers. These data suggest that spectral and temporal processing are segregated within field L, and provide a unifying account of how field L response properties depend on stimulus intensity.

AB  - Summary
Functional neuroimaging uses activity-dependent changes in cerebral blood flow to map brain activity, but the contributions of presynaptic and postsynaptic activity are incompletely understood, as are the underlying cellular pathways. Using intravital multiphoton microscopy, we measured presynaptic activity, postsynaptic neuronal and astrocytic calcium responses, and erythrocyte velocity and flux in olfactory glomeruli during odor stimulation in mice. Odor-evoked functional hyperemia in glomerular capillaries was highly correlated with glutamate release, but did not require local postsynaptic activity. Odor stimulation induced calcium transients in astrocyte endfeet and an associated dilation of upstream arterioles. Calcium elevations in astrocytes and functional hyperemia depended on astrocytic metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 and cyclooxygenase activation. Astrocytic glutamate transporters also contributed to functional hyperemia through mechanisms independent of calcium rises and cyclooxygenase activation. These local pathways initiated by glutamate account for a large part of the coupling between synaptic activity and functional hyperemia in the olfactory bulb.

AB  - Summary
A deficient extinction of memory is particularly important in the regime of fear, where it limits the beneficial outcomes of treatments of anxiety disorders. Fear extinction is thought to involve inhibitory influences of the prefrontal cortex on the amygdala, although the detailed synaptic mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we report that neuropeptide S (NPS), a recently discovered transmitter of ascending brainstem neurons, evokes anxiolytic effects and facilitates extinction of conditioned fear responses when administered into the amygdala in mice. An NPS receptor antagonist exerts functionally opposing responses, indicating that endogenous NPS is involved in anxiety behavior and extinction. Cellularly, NPS increases glutamatergic transmission to intercalated GABAergic neurons in the amygdala via presynaptic NPS receptors on connected principal neurons. These results identify mechanisms of NPS in the brain, a key role of intercalated neurons in the amygdala for fear extinction, and a potential pharmacological avenue for treating anxiety disorders.

AB  - Summary
It has been suggested that hippocampal activity predicts subsequent recognition success when recognition decisions are based disproportionately on recollection, whereas perirhinal activity predicts recognition success when decisions are based primarily on familiarity. Another perspective is that both hippocampal and perirhinal activity are predictive of overall memory strength. We tested the relationship between brain activity during learning and subsequent memory strength. Activity in a number of cortical regions (including regions within the “default network”) was negatively correlated with subsequent memory strength, suggesting that this activity reflects inattention or mind wandering (and, consequently, poor memory). In contrast, activity in both hippocampus and perirhinal cortex positively correlated with the subsequent memory strength of remembered items. This finding suggests that both structures cooperate during learning to determine the memory strength of what is being learned.

AB  - Summary
Neurotransmission in the brain is critically dependent on excitatory synaptic signaling mediated by AMPA-class ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPARs). AMPARs are known to be associated with Transmembrane AMPA receptor Regulatory Proteins (TARPs). In vertebrates, at least four TARPs appear to have redundant roles as obligate chaperones for AMPARs, thus greatly complicating analysis of TARP participation in synaptic function. We have overcome this limitation by identifying and mutating the essential set of TARPs in C. elegans (STG-1 and STG-2). In TARP mutants, AMPAR-mediated currents and worm behaviors are selectively disrupted despite apparently normal surface expression and clustering of the receptors. Reconstitution experiments indicate that both STG-1 and STG-2 can functionally substitute for vertebrate TARPs to modify receptor function. Thus, we show that TARPs are obligate auxiliary subunits for AMPARs with a primary, evolutionarily conserved functional role in the modification of current kinetics.

AB  - Summary
The ability of vertebrates to detect and avoid damaging extremes of temperature depends on activation of ion channels belonging to the thermo-TRP family. Injury or inflammation causes the release of inflammatory mediators which lower the threshold for detection of painful levels of heat, a process known as heat hyperalgesia. These inflammatory mediators act by at least three distinct intracellular signaling pathways. Here, we show that modulation of the sensitivity of the heat-activated ion channel TRPV1 by the protein kinases PKA and PKC and by the phosphatase calcineurin depends on the formation of a signaling complex between these enzymes, the scaffolding protein AKAP79/150 and TRPV1. We identify a critical region in the TRPV1 C-terminal which mediates binding of AKAP79/150. If binding is prevented, then sensitization by both bradykinin and PGE2 is abrogated. AKAP79/150 is therefore a final common element in heat hyperalgesia, on which the effects of multiple proinflammatory mediators converge.

However, the precise mechanism linking PLC to the gating of TRP has been elusive. In this issue of Neuron, Leung et al. provide compelling evidence that a diacylglycerol (DAG) lipase (INAE), acting downstream of the PLC, is essential for opening TRP. These results strongly support the model that a DAG metabolite is critical for TRP activation and suggest that mammalian DAG lipases may play similar roles.

AB  - Summary
Biologists postulate that sexual dimorphism in the brain underlies gender differences in behavior, yet direct evidence for this has been sparse. We identified a male-specific, fruitless (fru)/doublesex (dsx)-coexpressing neuronal cluster, P1, in Drosophila. The artificial induction of a P1 clone in females effectively provokes male-typical behavior in such females even when the other parts of the brain are not masculinized. P1, located in the dorsal posterior brain near the mushroom body, is composed of 20 interneurons, each of which has a primary transversal neurite with extensive ramifications in the bilateral protocerebrum. P1 is fated to die in females through the action of a feminizing protein, DsxF. A masculinizing protein Fru is required in the male brain for correct positioning of the terminals of P1 neurites. Thus, the coordinated actions of two sex determination genes, dsx and fru, confer the unique ability to initiate male-typical sexual behavior on P1 neurons.

AB  - Summary
Despite increasing evidence for transcriptional control of neural connectivity, how transcription factors regulate discrete steps in axon guidance remains obscure. Projection neurons in the dorsal spinal cord relay sensory signals to higher brain centers. Some projection neurons send their axons ipsilaterally, whereas others, commissural neurons, send axons contralaterally. We show that two closely related LIM homeodomain proteins, Lhx2 and Lhx9, are expressed by a set of commissural relay neurons (dI1c neurons) and are required for the dI1c axon projection. Midline crossing by dI1c axons is lost in Lhx2/9 double mutants, a defect that results from loss of expression of Rig-1 from dI1c axons. Lhx2 binds to a conserved motif in the Rig-1 gene, suggesting that Lhx2/9 regulate directly the expression of Rig-1. Our findings reveal a link between the transcriptional programs that define neuronal subtype identity and the expression of receptors that guide distinctive aspects of their trajectory.

AB  - Summary
The genetic mechanisms that regulate neurodegeneration are only poorly understood. We show that the loss of one allele of the p53 family member, p73, makes mice susceptible to neurodegeneration as a consequence of aging or Alzheimer's disease (AD). Behavioral analyses demonstrated that old, but not young, p73+/− mice displayed reduced motor and cognitive function, CNS atrophy, and neuronal degeneration. Unexpectedly, brains of aged p73+/− mice demonstrated dramatic accumulations of phospho-tau (P-tau)-positive filaments. Moreover, when crossed to a mouse model of AD expressing a mutant amyloid precursor protein, brains of these mice showed neuronal degeneration and early and robust formation of tangle-like structures containing P-tau. The increase in P-tau was likely mediated by JNK; in p73+/− neurons, the activity of the p73 target JNK was enhanced, and JNK regulated P-tau levels. Thus, p73 is essential for preventing neurodegeneration, and haploinsufficiency for p73 may be a susceptibility factor for AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Summary
In Drosophila, a phospholipase C-mediated signaling cascade links photoexcitation of rhodopsin to the opening of the TRP/TRPL channels. A lipid product of the cascade, diacylglycerol (DAG) and its metabolite(s), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), have both been proposed as potential excitatory messengers. A crucial enzyme in the understanding of this process is likely to be DAG lipase (DAGL). However, DAGLs that might fulfill this role have not been previously identified in any organism. In this work, the Drosophila DAGL gene, inaE, has been identified from mutants that are defective in photoreceptor responses to light. The inaE-encoded protein isoforms show high sequence similarity to known mammalian DAG lipases, exhibit DAG lipase activity in vitro, and are highly expressed in photoreceptors. Analyses of norpA inaE double mutants and severe inaE mutants show that normal DAGL activity is required for the generation of physiologically meaningful photoreceptor responses.

AB  - Summary
Understanding the control of myelin formation by oligodendrocytes is essential for treating demyelinating diseases. Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) type III, an EGF-like growth factor, is essential for myelination in the PNS. It is thus thought that NRG1/ErbB signaling also regulates CNS myelination, a view suggested by in vitro studies and the overexpression of dominant-negative ErbB receptors. To directly test this hypothesis, we generated a series of conditional null mutants that completely lack NRG1 beginning at different stages of neural development. Unexpectedly, these mice assemble normal amounts of myelin. In addition, double mutants lacking oligodendroglial ErbB3 and ErbB4 become myelinated in the absence of any stimulation by neuregulins. In contrast, a significant hypermyelination is achieved by transgenic overexpression of NRG1 type I or NRG1 type III. Thus, NRG1/ErbB signaling is markedly different between Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes that have evolved an NRG/ErbB-independent mechanism of myelination control.

AB  - Summary
Phototransduction in flies is the fastest known G protein-coupled signaling cascade, but how this performance is achieved remains unclear. Here, we investigate the mechanism and role of rhodopsin inactivation. We determined the lifetime of activated rhodopsin (metarhodopsin = M∗) in whole-cell recordings from Drosophila photoreceptors by measuring the time window within which inactivating M∗ by photoreisomerization to rhodopsin could suppress responses to prior illumination. M∗ was inactivated rapidly (τ ∼20 ms) under control conditions, but ∼10-fold more slowly in Ca2+-free solutions. This pronounced Ca2+ dependence of M∗ inactivation was unaffected by mutations affecting phosphorylation of rhodopsin or arrestin but was abolished in mutants of calmodulin (CaM) or the CaM-binding myosin III, NINAC. This suggests a mechanism whereby Ca2+ influx acting via CaM and NINAC accelerates the binding of arrestin to M∗. Our results indicate that this strategy promotes quantum efficiency, temporal resolution, and fidelity of visual signaling.

AB  - Summary
Recent efforts to translate basic research to the treatment of clinical disorders have led to a growing interest in exploring mechanisms for diminishing fear. This research has emphasized two approaches: extinction of conditioned fear, examined across species; and cognitive emotion regulation, unique to humans. Here, we sought to examine the similarities and differences in the neural mechanisms underlying these two paradigms for diminishing fear. Using an emotion regulation strategy, we examine the neural mechanisms of regulating conditioned fear using fMRI and compare the resulting activation pattern with that observed during classic extinction. Our results suggest that the lateral PFC regions engaged by cognitive emotion regulation strategies may influence the amygdala, diminishing fear through similar vmPFC connections that are thought to inhibit the amygdala during extinction. These findings further suggest that humans may have developed complex cognition that can aid in regulating emotional responses while utilizing phylogenetically shared mechanisms of extinction.

AB  - Summary
Arrestins are proteins that arrest the activity of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). While it is well established that normal inactivation of photoexcited rhodopsin, the GPCR of rod phototransduction, requires arrestin (Arr1), it has been controversial whether the same requirement holds for cone opsin inactivation. Mouse cone photoreceptors express two distinct visual arrestins: Arr1 and Arr4. By means of recordings from cones of mice with one or both arrestins knocked out, this investigation establishes that a visual arrestin is required for normal cone inactivation. Arrestin-independent inactivation is 70-fold more rapid in cones than in rods, however. Dual arrestin expression in cones could be a holdover from ancient genome duplication events that led to multiple isoforms of arrestin, allowing evolutionary specialization of one form while the other maintains the basic function.

AB  - Summary
The homeodomain transcription factor Nkx2-1 plays key roles in the developing telencephalon, where it regulates the identity of progenitor cells in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) and mediates the specification of several classes of GABAergic and cholinergic neurons. Here, we have investigated the postmitotic function of Nkx2-1 in the migration of interneurons originating in the MGE. Experimental manipulations and mouse genetics show that downregulation of Nkx2-1 expression in postmitotic cells is necessary for the migration of interneurons to the cortex, whereas maintenance of Nkx2-1 expression is required for interneuron migration to the striatum. Nkx2-1 exerts this role in the migration of MGE-derived interneurons by directly regulating the expression of a guidance receptor, Neuropilin-2, which enables interneurons to invade the developing striatum. Our results demonstrate a role for the cell-fate determinant Nkx2-1 in regulating neuronal migration by direct transcriptional regulation of guidance receptors in postmitotic cells.

AB  - Emotion plays a critical role in many contemporary accounts of decision making, but exactly what underlies its influence and how this is mediated in the brain remain far from clear. Here, we review behavioral studies that suggest that Pavlovian processes can exert an important influence over choice and may account for many effects that have traditionally been attributed to emotion. We illustrate how recent experiments cast light on the underlying structure of Pavlovian control and argue that generally this influence makes good computational sense. Corresponding neuroscientific data from both animals and humans implicate a central role for the amygdala through interactions with other brain areas. This yields a neurobiological account of emotion in which it may operate, often covertly, to optimize rather than corrupt economic choice.

AB  - Summary
Numerous linguistic operations have been assigned to cortical brain areas, but the contributions of subcortical structures to human language processing are still being discussed. Using simultaneous EEG recordings directly from deep brain structures and the scalp, we show that the human thalamus systematically reacts to syntactic and semantic parameters of auditorily presented language in a temporally interleaved manner in coordination with cortical regions. In contrast, two key structures of the basal ganglia, the globus pallidus internus and the subthalamic nucleus, were not found to be engaged in these processes. We therefore propose that syntactic and semantic language analysis is primarily realized within cortico-thalamic networks, whereas a cohesive basal ganglia network is not involved in these essential operations of language analysis.

AB  - The inner ear's performance is greatly enhanced by an active process defined by four features: amplification, frequency selectivity, compressive nonlinearity, and spontaneous otoacoustic emission. These characteristics emerge naturally if the mechanoelectrical transduction process operates near a dynamical instability, the Hopf bifurcation, whose mathematical properties account for specific aspects of our hearing. The active process of nonmammalian tetrapods depends upon active hair-bundle motility, which emerges from the interaction of negative hair-bundle stiffness and myosin-based adaptation motors. Taken together, these phenomena explain the four characteristics of the ear's active process. In the high-frequency region of the mammalian cochlea, the active process is dominated instead by the phenomenon of electromotility, in which the cell bodies of outer hair cells extend and contract as the protein prestin alters its membrane surface area in response to changes in membrane potential.

AB  - Summary
Accurate neural coding of the pitch of complex sounds is an essential part of auditory scene analysis; differences in pitch help segregate concurrent sounds, while similarities in pitch can help group sounds from a common source. In quiet, nonreverberant backgrounds, pitch can be derived from timing information in broadband high-frequency auditory channels and/or from frequency and timing information carried in narrowband low-frequency auditory channels. Recording from single neurons in the cochlear nucleus of anesthetized guinea pigs, we show that the neural representation of pitch based on timing information is severely degraded in the presence of reverberation. This degradation increases with both increasing reverberation strength and channel bandwidth. In a parallel human psychophysical pitch-discrimination task, reverberation impaired the ability to distinguish a high-pass harmonic sound from noise. Together, these findings explain the origin of perceptual difficulties experienced by both normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners in reverberant spaces.

AB  - Summary
Both cerebellum and neocortex receive input from the somatosensory system. Interaction between these regions has been proposed to underpin the correct selection and execution of motor commands, but it is not clear how such interactions occur. In neocortex, inputs give rise to population rhythms, providing a spatiotemporal coding strategy for inputs and consequent outputs. Here, we show that similar patterns of rhythm generation occur in cerebellum during nicotinic receptor subtype activation. Both gamma oscillations (30–80 Hz) and very fast oscillations (VFOs, 80–160 Hz) were generated by intrinsic cerebellar cortical circuitry in the absence of functional glutamatergic connections. As in neocortex, gamma rhythms were dependent on GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition, whereas VFOs required only nonsynaptically connected intercellular networks. The ability of cerebellar cortex to generate population rhythms within the same frequency bands as neocortex suggests that they act as a common spatiotemporal code within which corticocerebellar dialog may occur.

AB  - Summary
Synaptic activity produces short-lived second messengers that ultimately yield a long-term depression (LTD) of cerebellar Purkinje cells. Here, we test the hypothesis that these brief second messenger signals are translated into long-lasting biochemical signals by a positive feedback loop that includes protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein kinase. Histochemical “epistasis” experiments demonstrate the reciprocal activation of these kinases, and physiological experiments—including the use of a light-activated protein kinase—demonstrate that such reciprocal activation is required for LTD. Timed application of enzyme inhibitors reveals that this positive feedback loop causes PKC to be active for more than 20 min, allowing sufficient time for LTD expression. Such regenerative mechanisms may sustain other long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity and could be a general mechanism for prolonging signal transduction networks.

AB  - Summary
Previous neurophysiological studies suggest that attention can alter the baseline or gain of neurons in extrastriate visual areas but that it cannot change tuning. This suggests that neurons in visual cortex function as labeled lines whose meaning does not depend on task demands. To test this common assumption, we used a system identification approach to measure spatial frequency and orientation tuning in area V4 during two attentionally demanding visual search tasks, one that required fixation and one that allowed free viewing during search. We found that spatial attention modulates response baseline and gain but does not alter tuning, consistent with previous reports. In contrast, feature-based attention often shifts neuronal tuning. These tuning shifts are inconsistent with the labeled-line model and tend to enhance responses to stimulus features that distinguish the search target. Our data suggest that V4 neurons behave as matched filters that are dynamically tuned to optimize visual search.

AB  - Summary
Activity-dependent changes in the synaptic connections of the brain are thought to be important for learning and memory. Imaging techniques have enabled the examination of structural rearrangements during activity-dependent processes at the synapse. While many studies have examined structural changes of dendritic spines, little is known about structural plasticity of presynaptic boutons. We therefore examined how axonal boutons are affected during long-term depression (LTD). We used time lapse two-photon laser scanning microscopy and extracellular field recordings to monitor simultaneously synaptic morphology and activity for up to five hours in mouse organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. LTD induction dramatically increased the turnover of presynaptic boutons, while decreasing the number of putative synaptic contacts between Schaffer collateral boutons and spines of CA1 pyramidal cells. Our data indicate a substantial presynaptic contribution to activity-dependent morphological plasticity and provide opportunities for studying the molecular mechanisms of the structural remodeling of synaptic circuits.

AB  - Summary
In Drosophila embryos and larvae, a small number of identified motor neurons innervate body wall muscles in a highly stereotyped pattern. Although genetic screens have identified many proteins that are required for axon guidance and synaptogenesis in this system, little is known about the mechanisms by which muscle fibers are defined as targets for specific motor axons. To identify potential target labels, we screened 410 genes encoding cell-surface and secreted proteins, searching for those whose overexpression on all muscle fibers causes motor axons to make targeting errors. Thirty such genes were identified, and a number of these were members of a large gene family encoding proteins whose extracellular domains contain leucine-rich repeat (LRR) sequences, which are protein interaction modules. By manipulating gene expression in muscle 12, we showed that four LRR proteins participate in the selection of this muscle as the appropriate synaptic target for the RP5 motor neuron.

AB  - Summary
Innate chemosensory preferences are often encoded by sensory neurons that are specialized for attractive or avoidance behaviors. Here, we show that one olfactory neuron in Caenorhabditis elegans, AWCON, has the potential to direct both attraction and repulsion. Attraction, the typical AWCON behavior, requires a receptor-like guanylate cyclase GCY-28 that acts in adults and localizes to AWCON axons. gcy-28 mutants avoid AWCON-sensed odors; they have normal odor-evoked calcium responses in AWCON but reversed turning biases in odor gradients. In addition to gcy-28, a diacylglycerol/protein kinase C pathway that regulates neurotransmission switches AWCON odor preferences. A behavioral switch in AWCON may be part of normal olfactory plasticity, as odor conditioning can induce odor avoidance in wild-type animals. Genetic interactions, acute rescue, and calcium imaging suggest that the behavioral reversal results from presynaptic changes in AWCON. These results suggest that alternative modes of neurotransmission can couple one sensory neuron to opposite behavioral outputs.

AB  - Changes in intracellular calcium (Ca) concentration following synaptic and suprathreshold activity are mediated by a wide range of sources and contribute to the regulation of myriad neuronal functions. The development of Ca imaging techniques has dramatically increased our understanding of the complex interactions between different Ca sources and their ability to produce spatial and temporal specificity of signaling, even within small cellular compartments such as dendrites and dendritic spines. However, as the use of Ca imaging has become more prevalent, the need to exercise care in the experimental methodology and interpretation of data has also grown. In this review, we discuss the recent progress made using imaging methods in understanding dendritic Ca signaling and also describe a quantitative framework for using fluorescent indicators to experimentally measure and interpret changes in intracellular Ca.

AB  - Summary
The mushroom body is an insect brain structure required for olfactory learning. Its principal neurons, the Kenyon cells (KCs), form a large cell population. The neuronal populations from which their olfactory input derives (olfactory sensory and projection neurons) can be identified individually by genetic, anatomical, and physiological criteria. We ask whether KCs are similarly identifiable individually, using genetic markers and whole-cell patch-clamp in vivo. We find that across-animal responses are as diverse within the genetically labeled subset as across all KCs in a larger sample. These results combined with those from a simple model, using projection neuron odor responses as inputs, suggest that the precise circuit specification seen at earlier stages of odor processing is likely absent among the mushroom body KCs.

AB  - Summary
The time course of the requirement for local protein synthesis in the stabilization of learning-related synaptic growth and the persistence of long-term memory was examined using Aplysia bifurcated sensory neuron-motor neuron cultures. We find that, following repeated pulses of serotonin (5-HT), the local perfusion of emetine, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, or a TAT-AS oligonucleotide directed against ApCPEB blocks long-term facilitation (LTF) at either 24 or 48 hr and leads to a selective retraction of newly formed sensory neuron varicosities induced by 5-HT. By contrast, later inhibition of local protein synthesis, at 72 hr after 5-HT, has no effect on either synaptic growth or LTF. These results define a specific stabilization phase for the storage of long-term memory during which newly formed varicosities are labile and require sustained CPEB-dependent local protein synthesis to acquire the more stable properties of mature varicosities required for the persistence of LTF.

Decisions are often guided by generalizing from past experiences. Fundamental questions remain regarding the cognitive and neural mechanisms by which generalization takes place. Prior data suggest that generalization may stem from inference-based processes at the time of generalization. By contrast, generalization may emerge from mnemonic processes occurring while premise events are encoded. Here, participants engaged in a two-phase learning and generalization task, wherein they learned a series of overlapping associations and subsequently generalized what they learned to novel stimulus combinations. Functional MRI revealed that successful generalization was associated with coupled changes in learning-phase activity in the hippocampus and midbrain (ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra). These findings provide evidence for generalization based on integrative encoding, whereby overlapping past events are integrated into a linked mnemonic representation. Hippocampal-midbrain interactions support the dynamic integration of experiences, providing a powerful mechanism for building a rich associative history that extends beyond individual events.

AB  - Summary
A robust and well-organized rhythm is a key feature of many neuronal networks, including those that regulate essential behaviors such as circadian rhythmogenesis, breathing, and locomotion. Here we show that excitatory V3-derived neurons are necessary for a robust and organized locomotor rhythm during walking. When V3-mediated neurotransmission is selectively blocked by the expression of the tetanus toxin light chain subunit (TeNT), the regularity and robustness of the locomotor rhythm is severely perturbed. A similar degeneration in the locomotor rhythm occurs when the excitability of V3-derived neurons is reduced acutely by ligand-induced activation of the allatostatin receptor. The V3-derived neurons additionally function to balance the locomotor output between both halves of the spinal cord, thereby ensuring a symmetrical pattern of locomotor activity during walking. We propose that the V3 neurons establish a regular and balanced motor rhythm by distributing excitatory drive between both halves of the spinal cord.

AB  - Summary
Reverse signaling by ephrin-As upon binding EphAs controls axon guidance and mapping. Ephrin-As are GPI-anchored to the membrane, requiring that they complex with transmembrane proteins that transduce their signals. We show that the p75 neurotrophin receptor (NTR) serves this role in retinal axons. p75NTR and ephrin-A colocalize within caveolae along retinal axons and form a complex required for Fyn phosphorylation upon binding EphAs, activating a signaling pathway leading to cytoskeletal changes. In vitro, retinal axon repulsion to EphAs by ephrin-A reverse signaling requires p75NTR, but repulsion to ephrin-As by EphA forward signaling does not. Constitutive and retina-specific p75NTR knockout mice have aberrant anterior shifts in retinal axon terminations in superior colliculus, consistent with diminished repellent activity mediated by graded ephrin-A reverse signaling induced by graded collicular EphAs. We conclude that p75NTR is a signaling partner for ephrin-As and the ephrin-A- p75NTR complex reverse signals to mediate axon repulsion required for guidance and mapping.

AB  - Summary
Presenilin 1 (PS1) regulates environmental enrichment (EE)-mediated neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation and neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus. We now report that transgenic mice that ubiquitously express human PS1 variants linked to early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) neither exhibit EE-induced proliferation, nor neuronal lineage commitment of NPCs. Remarkably, the proliferation and differentiation of cultured NPCs from standard-housed mice expressing wild-type PS1 or PS1 variants are indistinguishable. On the other hand, wild-type NPCs cocultured with primary microglia from mice expressing PS1 variants exhibit impaired proliferation and neuronal lineage commitment, phenotypes that are recapitulated with mutant microglia conditioned media in which we detect altered levels of selected soluble signaling factors. These findings lead us to conclude that factors secreted from microglia play a central role in modulating hippocampal neurogenesis, and argue for non-cell-autonomous mechanisms that govern FAD-linked PS1-mediated impairments in adult hippocampal neurogenesis.

AB  - Astrocytes comprise approximately half of the volume of the adult mammalian brain and are the primary neuronal structural and trophic supportive elements. Astrocytes are organized into distinct nonoverlapping domains and extend elaborate and dense fine processes that interact intimately with synapses and cerebrovasculature. The recognition in the mid 1990s that astrocytes undergo elevations in intracellular calcium concentration following activation of G protein-coupled receptors by synaptically released neurotransmitters demonstrated not only that astrocytes display a form of excitability but also that astrocytes may be active participants in brain information processing. The roles that astrocytic calcium elevations play in neurophysiology and especially in modulation of neuronal activity have been intensely researched in recent years. This review will summarize the current understanding of the function of astrocytic calcium signaling in neurophysiological processes and discuss areas where the role of astrocytes remains controversial and will therefore benefit from further study.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of cognitive deficiency in humans and perhaps the best-understood single cause of autism. A trinucleotide repeat expansion, inactivating the X-linked FMR1 gene, leads to the absence of the fragile X mental retardation protein. FMRP is a selective RNA-binding protein that regulates the local translation of a subset of mRNAs at synapses in response to activation of Gp1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and possibly other receptors. In the absence of FMRP, excess and dysregulated mRNA translation leads to altered synaptic function and loss of protein synthesis-dependent plasticity. Recent evidence indicates the role of FMRP in regulated mRNA transport in dendrites. New studies also suggest a possible local function of FMRP in axons that may be important for guidance, synaptic development, and formation of neural circuits. The understanding of FMRP function at synapses has led to rationale therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Summary
Center-surround receptive fields are a fundamental unit of brain organization. It has been proposed that olfactory bulb mitral cells exhibit this functional circuitry, with excitation from one glomerulus and inhibition from a broad field of glomeruli within reach of the lateral dendrites. We investigated this hypothesis using a combination of in vivo intrinsic imaging, single-unit recording, and a large panel of odors. Assuming a broad inhibitory field, a mitral cell would be influenced by &gt;100 contiguous glomeruli and should respond to many odors. Instead, the observed response rate was an order of magnitude lower. A quantitative model indicates that mitral cell responses can be explained by just a handful of glomeruli. These glomeruli are spatially dispersed on the bulb and represent a broad range of odor sensitivities. We conclude that mitral cells do not have center-surround receptive fields. Instead, each mitral cell performs a specific computation combining a small and diverse set of glomerular inputs.

AB  - Summary
Drosophila vision is mediated by inputs from three types of photoreceptor neurons; R1–R6 mediate achromatic motion detection, while R7 and R8 constitute two chromatic channels. Neural circuits for processing chromatic information are not known. Here, we identified the first-order interneurons downstream of the chromatic channels. Serial EM revealed that small-field projection neurons Tm5 and Tm9 receive direct synaptic input from R7 and R8, respectively, and indirect input from R1–R6, qualifying them to function as color-opponent neurons. Wide-field Dm8 amacrine neurons receive input from 13–16 UV-sensing R7s and provide output to projection neurons. Using a combinatorial expression system to manipulate activity in different neuron subtypes, we determined that Dm8 neurons are necessary and sufficient for flies to exhibit phototaxis toward ultraviolet instead of green light. We propose that Dm8 sacrifices spatial resolution for sensitivity by relaying signals from multiple R7s to projection neurons, which then provide output to higher visual centers.

Results from imaging and lesion studies of item recognition memory have suggested that the hippocampus supports memory for the arbitrary associations that form the basis of episodic recollection, whereas the perirhinal cortex (PRc) supports familiarity for individual items. This view has been challenged, however, by findings showing that PRc may contribute to associative recognition, a task thought to measure relational or recollective memory. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate that PRc activity is increased when pairs of items are processed as a single configuration or unit and that this activity predicts subsequent familiarity-based associative memory. These results explain the discrepancy in the literature by showing that novel associations can be encoded in a unitized manner, thereby allowing PRc to support associative recognition based on familiarity.

While progenitor-restricted factors broadly specify area identities in developing neocortex, the downstream regulatory elements involved in acquisition of those identities in postmitotic neurons are largely unknown. Here, we identify Bhlhb5, a transcription factor expressed in layers II–V, as a postmitotic regulator of area identity. Bhlhb5 is initially expressed in a high caudomedial to low rostrolateral gradient that transforms into a sharp border between sensory and rostral motor cortices. Bhlhb5 null mice exhibit aberrant expression of area-specific genes and structural organization in the somatosensory and caudal motor cortices. In somatosensory cortex, Bhlhb5 null mice display postsynaptic disorganization of vibrissal barrels. In caudal motor cortex, Bhlhb5 null mice exhibit anomalous differentiation of corticospinal motor neurons, accompanied by failure of corticospinal tract formation. Together, these results demonstrate Bhlhb5's function as an area-specific transcription factor that regulates the postmitotic acquisition of area identities and elucidate the genetic hierarchy between progenitors and postmitotic neurons driving neocortical arealization.

Rett Syndrome (RTT) is an autism spectrum disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). In order to map the neuroanatomic origins of the complex neuropsychiatric behaviors observed in patients with RTT and to uncover endogenous functions of MeCP2 in the hypothalamus, we removed Mecp2 from Sim1-expressing neurons in the hypothalamus using Cre-loxP technology. Loss of MeCP2 in Sim1-expressing neurons resulted in mice that recapitulated the abnormal physiological stress response that is seen upon MeCP2 dysfunction in the entire brain. Surprisingly, we also uncovered a role for MeCP2 in the regulation of social and feeding behaviors since the Mecp2 conditional knockout (CKO) mice were aggressive, hyperphagic, and obese. This study demonstrates that deleting Mecp2 in a defined brain region is an excellent approach to map the neuronal origins of complex behaviors and provides new insight about the function of MeCP2 in specific neurons.

AB  - Summary
Previous work has demonstrated that the character of mouse cortical interneuron subtypes can be directly related to their embryonic temporal and spatial origins. The relationship between embryonic origin and the character of mature interneurons is likely reflected by the developmental expression of genes that direct cell fate. However, a thorough understanding of the early genetic events that specify subtype identity has been hampered by the perinatal lethality resulting from the loss of genes implicated in the determination of cortical interneurons. Here, we employ a conditional loss-of-function approach to demonstrate that the transcription factor Nkx2-1 is required for the proper specification of specific interneuron subtypes. Removal of this gene at distinct neurogenic time points results in a switch in the subtypes of neurons observed at more mature ages. Our strategy reveals a causal link between the embryonic genetic specification by Nkx2-1 in progenitors and the functional attributes of their neuronal progeny in the mature nervous system.

AB  - Summary
Normal brain function requires that the overall synaptic activity in neural circuits be kept constant. Long-term alterations of neural activity lead to homeostatic regulation of synaptic strength by a process known as synaptic scaling. The molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic scaling are largely unknown. Here, we report that all-trans retinoic acid (RA), a well-known developmental morphogen, unexpectedly mediates synaptic scaling in response to activity blockade. We show that activity blockade increases RA synthesis in neurons and that acute RA treatment enhances synaptic transmission. The RA-induced increase in synaptic strength is occluded by activity blockade-induced synaptic scaling. Suppression of RA synthesis prevents synaptic scaling. This form of RA signaling operates via a translation-dependent but transcription-independent mechanism, causes an upregulation of postsynaptic glutamate receptor levels, and requires RARα receptors. Together, our data suggest that RA functions in homeostatic plasticity as a signaling molecule that increases synaptic strength by a protein synthesis-dependent mechanism.

Like many synaptic proteins, rapsyn turns over rapidly at synapses. However, little is known about molecular mechanisms that govern rapsyn stability. Using a differential mass-spectrometry approach, we identified heat-shock protein 90β (HSP90β) as a component in surface AChR clusters. The HSP90β-AChR interaction required rapsyn and was stimulated by agrin. Inhibition of HSP90β activity or expression, or disruption of its interaction with rapsyn attenuated agrin-induced formation of AChR clusters in vitro and impaired the development and maintenance of the NMJ in vivo. Finally, we showed that HSP90β was necessary for rapsyn stabilization and regulated its proteasome-dependent degradation. Together, these results indicate a role of HSP90β in NMJ development by regulating rapsyn turnover and subsequent AChR cluster formation and maintenance.

AB  - Sexual courtship is a highly ritualized behavior in many animals. Recent work in the vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has illuminated how the pheromone cis-vaccenyl acetate modulates sexual behavior in the fly. Chemosensory receptors and a sexually dimorphic circuit activated by this pheromone have been identified. This minireview highlights recent advances in the field of fly courtship.

AB  - Voltage-gated calcium (Ca2+) channels initiate release of neurotransmitters at synapses, and regulation of presynaptic Ca2+ channels has a powerful influence on synaptic strength. Presynaptic Ca2+ channels form a large signaling complex, which targets synaptic vesicles to Ca2+ channels for efficient release and mediates Ca2+ channel regulation. Presynaptic plasticity regulates synaptic function on the timescale of milliseconds to minutes in response to neurotransmitters and the frequency of action potentials. This article reviews the regulation of presynaptic Ca2+ channels by effectors and regulators of Ca2+ signaling and describes the emerging evidence for a critical role of Ca2+ channel regulation in control of neurotransmission and in presynaptic plasticity. Failure of function and regulation of presynaptic Ca2+ channels leads to migraine, ataxia, and potentially other forms of neurological disease. We propose that presynaptic Ca2+ channels serve as the regulatory node in a dynamic, multilayered signaling network that exerts short-term control of neurotransmission in response to synaptic activity.

AB  - Summary
Spontaneous waves of activity propagating across large cortical areas may play important roles in sensory processing and circuit refinement. However, whether these waves are in turn shaped by sensory experience remains unclear. Here we report that visually evoked cortical activity reverberates in subsequent spontaneous waves. Voltage-sensitive dye imaging in rat visual cortex shows that following repetitive presentation of a given visual stimulus, spatiotemporal activity patterns resembling the evoked response appear more frequently in the spontaneous waves. This effect is specific to the response pattern evoked by the repeated stimulus, and it persists for several minutes without further visual stimulation. Such wave-mediated reverberation could contribute to short-term memory and help to consolidate the transient effects of recent sensory experience into long-lasting cortical modifications.

AB  - Summary
Rapid and selective erasures of certain types of memories in the brain would be desirable under certain clinical circumstances. By employing an inducible and reversible chemical-genetic technique, we find that transient αCaMKII overexpression at the time of recall impairs the retrieval of both newly formed one-hour object recognition memory and fear memories, as well as 1-month-old fear memories. Systematic analyses suggest that excessive αCaMKII activity-induced recall deficits are not caused by disrupting the retrieval access to the stored information but are, rather, due to the active erasure of the stored memories. Further experiments show that the recall-induced erasure of fear memories is highly restricted to the memory being retrieved while leaving other memories intact. Therefore, our study reveals a molecular genetic paradigm through which a given memory, such as new or old fear memory, can be rapidly and specifically erased in a controlled and inducible manner in the brain.

AB  - Summary
CREST plays a critical role in activity-dependent development, but its mechanism of action is not well understood. Here, we show that a CREST-BRG1 complex regulates promoter activation by orchestrating a calcium-dependent release of a repressor complex and a recruitment of an activator complex. In resting neurons, transcription of the c-fos promoter is inhibited by BRG1-dependent recruitment of a phospho-Rb-HDAC repressor complex. Upon calcium influx, Rb becomes dephosphorylated at serine 795 by calcineurin, which leads to release of the repressor complex. At the same time, there is increased recruitment of CBP to the promoter by a CREST-dependent mechanism, which leads to transcriptional activation. The CREST-BRG1 also binds to the NR2B promoter, and activity-dependent induction of NR2B expression involves a release of HDAC1 and recruitment of CBP, suggesting that this mechanism may be generally involved in regulating calcium-dependent transcription of neuronal genes.

AB  - Summary
The thalamo-cortical pathway is the crucial sensory gateway into the cerebral cortex. We aimed to determine the nature of the tactile information encoded by neurons in the whisker somatosensory relay nucleus (VPm). We wanted to distinguish whether VPm neurons encode similar stimulus features, acting as a single information channel, or encode diverse features. We recorded responses to whisker deflections that thoroughly explored the space of temporal stimulus variables and identified features to which neurons were selective by reverse correlation. The timescale of the features was typically 1–2 ms, at the limit imposed by our experimental conditions, indicating highly acute feature selectivity. Sensitivity to stimulus kinetics was strikingly diverse. Some neurons (25%) only encoded velocity; others were sensitive to position, acceleration, or more complex features. A minority (19%) encoded two or more features. These results indicate that VPm contains a distributed representation of whisker motion, based on high-resolution kinetic features.

AB  - Summary
The vestibular system is responsible for transforming head motion into precise eye, head, and body movements that rapidly stabilize gaze and posture. How do central excitatory synapses mediate behavioral outputs accurately matched to sensory inputs over a wide dynamic range? Here we demonstrate that vestibular afferent synapses in vitro express frequency-independent transmission that spans their in vivo dynamic range (5–150 spikes/s). As a result, the synaptic charge transfer per unit time is linearly related to vestibular afferent activity in both projection and intrinsic neurons of the vestibular nuclei. Neither postsynaptic glutamate receptor desensitization nor saturation affect the relative amplitude or frequency-independence of steady-state transmission. Finally, we show that vestibular nucleus neurons can transduce synaptic inputs into linear changes in firing rate output without relying on one-to-one calyceal transmission. These data provide a physiological basis for the remarkable linearity of vestibular reflexes.

AB  - Summary
The transient, A-type K+ current (IA) controls the excitability of CA1 pyramidal neuron dendrites by regulating the back-propagation of action potentials and by shaping synaptic input. Dendritic A-type K+ channels are targeted for modulation during long-term potentiation (LTP) and we have recently shown that activity-dependent internalization of the A-type channel subunit Kv4.2 enhances synaptic currents. However, the effect of changes in IA on the ability to induce subsequent synaptic plasticity (metaplasticity) has not been investigated. Here, we show that altering functional Kv4.2 expression level leads to a rapid, bidirectional remodeling of CA1 synapses. Neurons exhibiting enhanced IA showed a decrease in relative synaptic NR2B/NR2A subunit composition and did not exhibit LTP. Conversely, reducing IA by expression of a Kv4.2 dominant-negative or through genomic knockout of Kv4.2 led to an increased fraction of synaptic NR2B/NR2A and enhanced LTP. Bidirectional synaptic remodeling was mimicked in experiments manipulating intracellular Ca2+ and dependent on spontaneous activation of NMDA receptors and CaMKII activity. Our data suggest that A-type K+ channels are an integral part of a synaptic complex that regulates Ca2+ signaling through spontaneous NMDAR activation to control synaptic NMDAR expression and plasticity.

AB  - Summary
Mechanistic studies of CNS myelination have been hindered by the lack of a rapidly myelinating culture system. Here, we describe a versatile CNS coculture method that allows time-lapse microscopy and molecular analysis of distinct stages of myelination. Employing a culture architecture of reaggregated neurons fosters extension of dense beds of axons from purified retinal ganglion cells. Seeding of oligodendrocyte precursor cells on these axons results in differentiation and ensheathment in as few as 3 days, with generation of compact myelin within 6 days. This technique enabled (1) the demonstration that oligodendrocytes initiate new myelin segments only during a brief window early in their differentiation, (2) identification of a contribution of astrocytes to the rate of myelin wrapping, and (3) molecular dissection of the role of oligodendrocyte γ-secretase activity in controlling the ensheathment of axons. These insights illustrate the value of this defined system for investigating multiple aspects of CNS myelination.

AB  - Summary
The molecular mechanisms regulating the sensitivity of sensory circuits to environmental stimuli are poorly understood. We demonstrate here a central role for stem cell factor (SCF) and its receptor, c-Kit, in tuning the responsiveness of sensory neurons to natural stimuli. Mice lacking SCF/c-Kit signaling displayed profound thermal hypoalgesia, attributable to a marked elevation in the thermal threshold and reduction in spiking rate of heat-sensitive nociceptors. Acute activation of c-Kit by its ligand, SCF, resulted in a reduced thermal threshold and potentiation of heat-activated currents in isolated small-diameter neurons and thermal hyperalgesia in mice. SCF-induced thermal hyperalgesia required the TRP family cation channel TRPV1. Lack of c-Kit signaling during development resulted in hypersensitivity of discrete mechanoreceptive neuronal subtypes. Thus, c-Kit can now be grouped with a small family of receptor tyrosine kinases, including c-Ret and TrkA, that control the transduction properties of sensory neurons.

AB  - Summary
In a complex nervous system, neuronal functional diversity is reflected in the wide variety of dendritic arbor shapes. Different neuronal classes are defined by class-specific transcription factor combinatorial codes. We show that the combination of the transcription factors Knot and Cut is particular to Drosophila class IV dendritic arborization (da) neurons. Knot and Cut control different aspects of the dendrite cytoskeleton, promoting microtubule- and actin-based dendritic arbors, respectively. Knot delineates class IV arbor morphology by simultaneously synergizing with Cut to promote complexity and repressing Cut-mediated promotion of dendritic filopodia/spikes. Knot increases dendritic arbor outgrowth through promoting the expression of Spastin, a microtubule-severing protein disrupted in autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia (AD-HSP). Knot and Cut may modulate cellular mechanisms that are conserved between Drosophila and vertebrates. Hence, this study gives significant general insight into how multiple transcription factors combine to control class-specific dendritic arbor morphology through controlling different aspects of the cytoskeleton.

Due to fixational eye movements, the image on the retina is always in motion, even when one views a stationary scene. When an object moves within the scene, the corresponding patch of retina experiences a different motion trajectory than the surrounding region. Certain retinal ganglion cells respond selectively to this condition, when the motion in the cell's receptive field center is different from that in the surround. Here we show that this response is strongest at the very onset of differential motion, followed by gradual adaptation with a time course of several seconds. Different subregions of a ganglion cell's receptive field can adapt independently. The circuitry responsible for differential motion adaptation lies in the inner retina. Several candidate mechanisms were tested, and the adaptation most likely results from synaptic depression at the synapse from bipolar to ganglion cell. Similar circuit mechanisms may act more generally to emphasize novel features of a visual stimulus.

AB  - Summary
The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of rhesus monkeys has been found to encode the behavioral meaning of categories of sensory stimuli. When animals are instructed with sensory cues to make either eye or hand movements to a target, PPC cells also show specificity depending on which effector (eye or hand) is instructed for the movement. To determine whether this selectivity retrospectively reflects the behavioral meaning of the cue or prospectively encodes the movement plan, we trained monkeys to autonomously choose to acquire a target in the absence of direct instructions specifying which effector to use. Activity in PPC showed strong specificity for effector choice, with cells in the lateral intraparietal area selective for saccades and cells in the parietal reach region selective for reaches. Such differential activity associated with effector choice under identical stimulus conditions provides definitive evidence that the PPC is prospectively involved in action selection and movement preparation.

AB  - Summary
Previous work has identified alterations in histone acetylation in animal models of drug addiction and depression. However, the mechanisms which integrate drugs and stress with changes in chromatin structure remain unclear. Here, we identify the activity-dependent class II histone deacetylase, HDAC5, as a central integrator of these stimuli with changes in chromatin structure and gene expression. Chronic, but not acute, exposure to cocaine or stress decreases HDAC5 function in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a major brain reward region, which allows for increased histone acetylation and transcription of HDAC5 target genes. This regulation is behaviorally important, as loss of HDAC5 causes hypersensitive responses to chronic, not acute, cocaine or stress. These findings suggest that proper balance of histone acetylation is a crucial factor in the saliency of a given stimulus and that disruption of this balance is involved in the transition from an acute adaptive response to a chronic psychiatric illness.

AB  - Summary
The organization of neuronal wiring into layers and columns is a common feature of both vertebrate and invertebrate brains. In the Drosophila visual system, each R7 photoreceptor axon projects within a single column to a specific layer of the optic lobe. We refer to the restriction of terminals to single columns as tiling. In a genetic screen based on an R7-dependent behavior, we identified the Activin receptor Baboon and the nuclear import adaptor Importin-α3 as being required to prevent R7 axon terminals from overlapping with the terminals of R7s in neighboring columns. This tiling function requires the Baboon ligand, dActivin, the transcription factor, dSmad2, and retrograde transport from the growth cone to the R7 nucleus. We propose that dActivin is an autocrine signal that restricts R7 growth cone motility, and we demonstrate that it acts in parallel with a paracrine signal that mediates repulsion between R7 terminals.

AB  - The frontal eye field (FEF) has been known as a key player in the generation of saccade motor commands and in the allocation of spatial attention. In this issue of Neuron, Schafer and Moore demonstrate that FEF microstimulation enhances the effect of a position illusion induced by visual motion on saccades. This finding suggests that FEF activity can modulate the deployment of spatial attention, which in turn can alter saccade motor commands.

AB  - Summary
Phosphoinositides have been implicated in synaptic vesicle recycling largely based on studies of enzymes that regulate phosphoinositide synthesis and hydrolysis. One such enzyme is synaptojanin1, a multifunctional protein conserved from yeast to humans, which contains two phosphoinositol phosphatase domains and a proline-rich domain. Genetic ablation of synaptojanin1 leads to pleiotropic defects in presynaptic function, including accumulation of free clathrin-coated vesicles and delayed vesicle reavailability, implicating this enzyme in postendocytic uncoating of vesicles. To further elucidate the role of synaptojanin1 at nerve terminals, we performed quantitative synaptic vesicle recycling assays in synj1−/− neurons. Our studies show that synaptojanin1 is also required for normal vesicle endocytosis. Defects in both endocytosis and postendocytic vesicle reavailability can be fully restored upon reintroduction of synaptojanin1. However, expression of synaptojanin1 with mutations abolishing catalytic activity of each phosphatase domain reveals that the dual action of both domains is required for normal synaptic vesicle internalization and reavailability.

AB  - Summary
Oscillations in neural activity are a prominent feature of many brain states. Individual hippocampal neurons exhibit intrinsic membrane potential oscillations and intrinsic resonance in the theta frequency range. We found that the subthreshold resonance frequency of CA1 pyramidal neurons was location dependent, varying more than 3-fold between the soma and the distal dendrites. Furthermore, activity- and NMDA-receptor-dependent long-term plasticity increased this resonance frequency through changes in h channel properties. The increase in resonance frequency and an associated reduction in excitability were nearly identical in the soma and the first 300 μm of the apical dendrites. These spatially widespread changes accompanying long-term synaptic potentiation also reduced the neuron's ability to elicit spikes evoked through a nonpotentiated synaptic pathway. Our results suggest that the frequency response of these neurons depends on the dendritic location of their inputs and that activity can regulate their response dynamics within an oscillating neural network.

AB  - Summary
Many theories of cerebellar function assume that long-term depression (LTD) of parallel fiber (PF) synapses enables Purkinje cells to learn to recognize PF activity patterns. We have studied the LTD-based recognition of PF patterns in a biophysically realistic Purkinje-cell model. With simple-spike firing as observed in vivo, the presentation of a pattern resulted in a burst of spikes followed by a pause. Surprisingly, the best criterion to distinguish learned patterns was the duration of this pause. Moreover, our simulations predicted that learned patterns elicited shorter pauses, thus increasing Purkinje-cell output. We tested this prediction in Purkinje-cell recordings both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, we found a shortening of pauses when decreasing the number of active PFs or after inducing LTD. In vivo, we observed longer pauses in LTD-deficient mice. Our results suggest a novel form of neural coding in the cerebellar cortex.

AB  - Summary
The role of the axonal membrane compartment in synaptic integration is usually neglected. We show here that in interneurons of the cerebellar molecular layer, where dendrites are so short that the somatodendritic domain can be considered isopotential, the axonal membrane contributes a significant part of the cell input capacitance. We examine the impact of axonal membrane on synaptic integration by cutting the axon with two-photon illumination. We find that the axonal compartment acts as a sink for signals generated at fast conductance synapses, thus increasing the initial decay rate of corresponding synaptic potentials over the value predicted from the resistance-capacitance (RC) product of the cell membrane; signals generated at slower synapses are much less affected. This mechanism sharpens the spike firing precision of fast glutamatergic inputs without resorting to multisynaptic pathways.

AB  - Summary
To support the role of DISC1 in human psychiatric disorders, we identified and analyzed two independently derived ENU-induced mutations in Exon 2 of mouse Disc1. Mice with mutation Q31L showed depressive-like behavior with deficits in the forced swim test and other measures that were reversed by the antidepressant bupropion, but not by rolipram, a phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor. In contrast, L100P mutant mice exhibited schizophrenic-like behavior, with profound deficits in prepulse inhibition and latent inhibition that were reversed by antipsychotic treatment. Both mutant DISC1 proteins exhibited reduced binding to the known DISC1 binding partner PDE4B. Q31L mutants had lower PDE4B activity, consistent with their resistance to rolipram, suggesting decreased PDE4 activity as a contributory factor in depression. This study demonstrates that Disc1 missense mutations in mice give rise to phenotypes related to depression and schizophrenia, thus supporting the role of DISC1 in major mental illness.

AB  - Summary
Neuregulin-1 (NRG1), a regulator of neural development, has been shown to regulate neurotransmission at excitatory synapses. Although ErbB4, a key NRG1 receptor, is expressed in glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)-positive neurons, little is known about its role in GABAergic transmission. We show that ErbB4 is localized at GABAergic terminals of the prefrontal cortex. Our data indicate a role of NRG1, both endogenous and exogenous, in regulation of GABAergic transmission. This effect was blocked by inhibition or mutation of ErbB4, suggesting the involvement of ErbB4. Together, these results indicate that NRG1 regulates GABAergic transmission via presynaptic ErbB4 receptors, identifying a novel function of NRG1. Because both NRG1 and ErbB4 have emerged as susceptibility genes of schizophrenia, these observations may suggest a mechanism for abnormal GABAergic neurotransmission in this disorder.

AB  - Summary
Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) signaling participates in numerous neurodevelopmental processes. Through linkage analysis, nrg1 has been associated with schizophrenia, although its pathophysiological role is not understood. The prevailing models of schizophrenia invoke hypofunction of the glutamatergic synapse and defects in early development of hippocampal-cortical circuitry. Here, we show that the erbB4 receptor, as a postsynaptic target of NRG1, plays a key role in activity-dependent maturation and plasticity of excitatory synaptic structure and function. Synaptic activity leads to the activation and recruitment of erbB4 into the synapse. Overexpressed erbB4 selectively enhances AMPA synaptic currents and increases dendritic spine size. Preventing NRG1/erbB4 signaling destabilizes synaptic AMPA receptors and leads to loss of synaptic NMDA currents and spines. Our results indicate that normal activity-driven glutamatergic synapse development is impaired by genetic deficits in NRG1/erbB4 signaling leading to glutamatergic hypofunction. These findings link proposed effectors in schizophrenia: NRG1/erbB4 signaling perturbation, neurodevelopmental deficit, and glutamatergic hypofunction.

AB  - Summary
Nonvisual responses to light, such as photic entrainment of the circadian clock, involve intrinsically light-sensitive melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells as well as rod and cone photoreceptors. However, previous studies have been unable to demonstrate a specific contribution of cones in the photic control of circadian responses to light. Using a mouse model that specifically lacks mid-wavelength (MW) cones we show that these photoreceptors play a significant role in light entrainment and in phase shifting of the circadian oscillator. The contribution of MW cones is mainly observed for light exposures of short duration and toward the longer wavelength region of the spectrum, consistent with the known properties of this opsin. Modeling the contributions of the various photoreceptors stresses the importance of considering the particular spectral, temporal, and irradiance response domains of the photopigments when assessing their role and contribution in circadian responses to light.

This review considers how transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs), a novel family of AMPAR auxiliary subunits, have changed our view of AMPAR transport and raised some perplexing questions.

AB  - Summary
The action of visual experience on visual cortical circuits is maximal during a critical period of postnatal development. The long-term effects of this experience are likely mediated by signaling cascades regulating experience-dependent gene transcription. Developmental modifications of these pathways could explain the difference in plasticity between the young and adult cortex. We studied the pathways linking experience-dependent activation of ERK to CREB-mediated gene expression in vivo. In juvenile mice, visual stimulation that activates CREB-mediated gene transcription also induced ERK-dependent MSK and histone H3 phosphorylation and H3-H4 acetylation, an epigenetic mechanism of gene transcription activation. In adult animals, ERK and MSK were still inducible; however, visual stimulation induced weak CREB-mediated gene expression and H3-H4 posttranslational modifications. Stimulation of histone acetylation in adult animals by means of trichostatin promoted ocular dominance plasticity. Thus, differing, experience-dependent activations of signaling molecules might be at the basis of the differences in experience-dependent plasticity between juvenile and adult cortex.

AB  - Summary
Each odorant receptor gene defines a unique type of olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) and a corresponding type of second-order neuron. Because each odor can activate multiple ORN types, information must ultimately be integrated across these processing channels to form a unified percept. Here, we show that, in Drosophila, integration begins at the level of second-order projection neurons (PNs). We genetically silence all the ORNs that normally express a particular odorant receptor and find that PNs postsynaptic to the silent glomerulus receive substantial lateral excitatory input from other glomeruli. Genetically confining odor-evoked ORN input to just one glomerulus reveals that most PNs postsynaptic to other glomeruli receive indirect excitatory input from the single ORN type that is active. Lateral connections between identified glomeruli vary in strength, and this pattern of connections is stereotyped across flies. Thus, a dense network of lateral connections distributes odor-evoked excitation between channels in the first brain region of the olfactory processing stream.

P2X receptors are trimeric cation channels that open in response to binding of extracellular ATP. Each subunit contains a large extracellular ligand binding domain and two flanking transmembrane (TM) helices that form the pore, but the extent of gating motions of the TM helices is unclear. We probed these motions using ivermectin (IVM), a macrocyclic lactone that stabilizes the open state of P2X4 receptor channels. We find that IVM partitions into lipid membranes and that transfer of the TM regions of P2X4 receptors is sufficient to convey sensitivity to the lactone, suggesting that IVM interacts most favorably with the open conformation of the two TM helices at the protein-lipid interface. Scanning mutagenesis of the two TMs identifies residues that change environment between closed and open states, and substitutions at a subset of these positions weaken IVM binding. The emerging patterns point to widespread rearrangements of the TM helices during opening of P2X receptor channels.

AB  - Summary
Intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) activates the neural pathways that mediate reward, including dopaminergic terminal areas such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, a direct role of dopamine in ICSS-mediated reward has been questioned. Here, simultaneous voltammetric and electrophysiological recordings from the same electrode reveal that, at certain sites, the onset of anticipatory dopamine surges and changes in neuronal firing patterns during ICSS are coincident, whereas sites lacking dopamine changes also lack patterned firing. Intrashell microinfusion of a D1, but not a D2 receptor antagonist, blocks ICSS. An iontophoresis approach was implemented to explore the effect of dopamine antagonists on firing patterns without altering behavior. Similar to the microinfusion experiments, ICSS-related firing is selectively attenuated following D1 receptor blockade. This work establishes a temporal link between anticipatory rises of dopamine and firing patterns in the NAc shell during ICSS and suggests that they may play a similar role with natural rewards and during drug self-administration.

AB  - Summary
Conductance-based neuronal network models can help us understand how synaptic and cellular mechanisms underlie brain function. However, these complex models are difficult to develop and are inaccessible to most neuroscientists. Moreover, even the most biologically realistic network models disregard many 3D anatomical features of the brain. Here, we describe a new software application, neuroConstruct, that facilitates the creation, visualization, and analysis of networks of multicompartmental neurons in 3D space. A graphical user interface allows model generation and modification without programming. Models within neuroConstruct are based on new simulator-independent NeuroML standards, allowing automatic generation of code for NEURON or GENESIS simulators. neuroConstruct was tested by reproducing published models and its simulator independence verified by comparing the same model on two simulators. We show how more anatomically realistic network models can be created and their properties compared with experimental measurements by extending a published 1D cerebellar granule cell layer model to 3D.

AB  - Summary
Synaptic activity regulates the postsynaptic accumulation of AMPA receptors over timescales ranging from minutes to days. Indeed, the regulated trafficking and mobility of GluR1 AMPA receptors underlies many forms of synaptic potentiation at glutamatergic synapses throughout the brain. However, the basis for synapse-specific accumulation of GluR1 is unknown. Here we report that synaptic activity locally immobilizes GluR1 AMPA receptors at individual synapses. Using single-molecule tracking together with the silencing of individual presynaptic boutons, we demonstrate that local synaptic activity reduces diffusional exchange of GluR1 between synaptic and extraynaptic domains, resulting in postsynaptic accumulation of GluR1. At neighboring inactive synapses, GluR1 is highly mobile with individual receptors frequently escaping the synapse. Within the synapse, spontaneous activity confines the diffusional movement of GluR1 to restricted subregions of the postsynaptic membrane. Thus, local activity restricts GluR1 mobility on a submicron scale, defining an input-specific mechanism for regulating AMPA receptor composition and abundance.

AB  - Summary
Alternative splicing of the Drosophila gene Dscam results in up to 38,016 different receptor isoforms proposed to interact by isoform-specific homophilic binding. We report that Dscam controls cell-intrinsic aspects of dendrite guidance in all four classes of dendrite arborization (da) neurons. Loss of Dscam in single neurons causes a strong increase in self-crossing. Restriction of dendritic fields of neighboring class III neurons appeared intact in mutant neurons, suggesting that dendritic self-avoidance, but not heteroneuronal tiling, may depend on Dscam. Overexpression of the same Dscam isoforms in two da neurons with overlapping dendritic fields forced a spatial segregation of the two fields, supporting the model that dendritic branches of da neurons use isoform-specific homophilic interactions to ensure minimal overlap. Homophilic binding of the highly diverse extracellular domains of Dscam may therefore limit the use of the same “core” repulsion mechanism to cell-intrinsic interactions without interfering with heteroneuronal interactions.

AB  - Summary
Local GABAergic circuits trigger visual cortical plasticity in early postnatal life. How these diverse connections contribute to critical period onset was investigated by nonstationary fluctuation analysis following laser photo-uncaging of GABA onto discrete sites upon individual pyramidal cells in slices of mouse visual cortex. The GABAA receptor number decreased on the soma-proximal dendrite (SPD), but not at the axon initial segment, with age and sensory deprivation. Benzodiazepine sensitivity was also higher on the immature SPD. Too many or too few SPD receptors in immature or dark-reared mice, respectively, were adjusted to critical period levels by benzodiazepine treatment in vivo, which engages ocular dominance plasticity in these animal models. Combining GAD65 deletion with dark rearing from birth confirmed that an intermediate number of SPD receptors enable plasticity. Site-specific optimization of perisomatic GABA response may thus trigger experience-dependent development in visual cortex.

AB  - Summary
The pictorial content of visual memories recalled by association is embodied by neuronal activity at the highest processing stages of primate visual cortex. This activity is elicited by top-down signals from the frontal lobe and recapitulates the bottom-up pattern normally obtained by the recalled stimulus. To explore the generality and mechanisms of this phenomenon, we recorded motion-sensitive neurons at an early stage of cortical processing. After monkeys learned to associate directions of motion with static shapes, these neurons exhibited unprecedented selectivity for the shapes. This emergent shape selectivity reflects activation of neurons representing the motion stimuli recalled by association, and it suggests that recall-related activity may be a general feature of neurons in visual cortex.

AB  - Summary
Simple cells in primary visual cortex exhibit contrast-invariant orientation tuning, in seeming contradiction to feed-forward models that rely on lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) input alone. Contrast invariance has therefore been thought to depend on the presence of intracortical lateral inhibition. In vivo intracellular recordings instead suggest that contrast invariance can be explained by three properties of the excitatory pathway. (1) Depolarizations evoked by orthogonal stimuli are determined by the amount of excitation a cell receives from the LGN, relative to the excitation it receives from other cortical cells. (2) Depolarizations evoked by preferred stimuli saturate at lower contrasts than the spike output of LGN relay cells. (3) Visual stimuli evoke contrast-dependent changes in trial-to-trial variability, which lead to contrast-dependent changes in the relationship between membrane potential and spike rate. Thus, high-contrast, orthogonally oriented stimuli that evoke significant depolarizations evoke few spikes. Together these mechanisms, without lateral inhibition, can account for contrast-invariant stimulus selectivity.

AB  - Summary
Several genetic strategies for inhibiting neuronal function in mice have been described, but no system that directly suppresses membrane excitability and is triggered by a systemically administered drug, has been validated in awake behaving animals. We expressed unilaterally in mouse striatum a modified heteromeric ivermectin (IVM)-gated chloride channel from C. elegans (GluClαβ), systemically administered IVM, and then assessed amphetamine-induced rotational behavior. Rotation was observed as early as 4 hr after a single intraperitoneal IVM injection (10 mg/kg), reached maximal levels by 12 hr, and was almost fully reversed by 4 days. Multiple cycles of silencing and recovery could be performed in a single animal. In striatal slice preparations from GluClαβ-expressing animals, IVM rapidly suppressed spiking. The two-subunit GluCl/IVM system permits “intersectional” strategies designed to increase the cellular specificity of silencing in transgenic animals.

A basic tenet of microeconomics suggests that the subjective value of financial gains decreases with increasing assets of individuals (“marginal utility”). Using concepts from learning theory and microeconomics, we assessed the capacity of financial rewards to elicit behavioral and neuronal changes during reward-predictive learning in participants with different financial backgrounds. Behavioral learning speed during both acquisition and extinction correlated negatively with the assets of the participants, irrespective of education and age. Correspondingly, response changes in midbrain and striatum measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging were slower during both acquisition and extinction with increasing assets and income of the participants. By contrast, asymptotic magnitudes of behavioral and neuronal responses after learning were unrelated to personal finances. The inverse relationship of behavioral and neuronal learning speed with personal finances is compatible with the general concept of decreasing marginal utility with increasing wealth.

AB  - Understanding the principles of information processing in neural circuits requires systematic characterization of the participating cell types and their connections, and the ability to measure and perturb their activity. Genetic approaches promise to bring experimental access to complex neural systems, including genetic stalwarts such as the fly and mouse, but also to nongenetic systems such as primates. Together with anatomical and physiological methods, cell-type-specific expression of protein markers and sensors and transducers will be critical to construct circuit diagrams and to measure the activity of genetically defined neurons. Inactivation and activation of genetically defined cell types will establish causal relationships between activity in specific groups of neurons, circuit function, and animal behavior. Genetic analysis thus promises to reveal the logic of the neural circuits in complex brains that guide behaviors. Here we review progress in the genetic analysis of neural circuits and discuss directions for future research and development.

AB  - Summary
Changes in cytosolic calcium are crucial for numerous processes including neuronal plasticity. This study investigates the regulation of cytosolic calcium by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in midbrain dopamine neurons. The results demonstrate that CRF stimulates the release of intracellular calcium from stores through activation of adenylyl cyclase and PKA. Imaging and photolysis experiments showed that the calcium originated from dendrites and required both functional IP3 and ryanodine receptor channels. The elevation in cytosolic calcium potentiated calcium-sensitive potassium channels (sK) activated by action potentials and metabotropic Gq-coupled receptors for glutamate and acetylcholine. This increase in cytosolic calcium activated by postsynaptic Gs-coupled CRF receptors may represent a fundamental mechanism by which stress peptides and hormones can shape Gq-coupled receptor-mediated regulation of neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity in dopamine neurons.

AB  - Summary
Regulation of synaptic growth is fundamental to the formation and plasticity of neural circuits. Here, we demonstrate that Nervous wreck (Nwk), a negative regulator of synaptic growth at Drosophila NMJs, interacts functionally and physically with components of the endocytic machinery, including dynamin and Dap160/intersectin, and negatively regulates retrograde BMP growth signaling through a direct interaction with the BMP receptor, thickveins. Synaptic overgrowth in nwk is sensitive to BMP signaling levels, and loss of Nwk facilitates BMP-induced overgrowth. Conversely, Nwk overexpression suppresses BMP-induced synaptic overgrowth. We observe analogous genetic interactions between dap160 and the BMP pathway, confirming that endocytosis regulates BMP signaling at NMJs. Finally, we demonstrate a correlation between synaptic growth and pMAD levels and show that Nwk regulates these levels. We propose that Nwk functions at the interface of endocytosis and BMP signaling to ensure proper synaptic growth by negatively regulating Tkv to set limits on this positive growth signal.

AB  - Summary
Do neurons in primary motor cortex encode the generative details of motor behavior, such as individual muscle activities, or do they encode high-level movement attributes? Resolving this question has proven difficult, in large part because of the sizeable uncertainty inherent in estimating or measuring the joint torques and muscle forces that underlie movements made by biological limbs. We circumvented this difficulty by considering single-neuron responses in an isometric task, where joint torques and muscle forces can be straightforwardly computed from limb geometry. The response for each neuron was modeled as a linear function of a “preferred” joint torque vector, and this model was fit to individual neural responses across variations in limb posture. The resulting goodness of fit suggests that neurons in motor cortex do encode the kinetics of motor behavior and that the neural response properties of “preferred direction” and “gain” are dual components of a unitary response vector.

AB  - Summary
Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) form synapses with local interneurons and second-order projection neurons to form stereotyped olfactory glomeruli. This primary olfactory circuit is hard-wired through the action of genetic cues. We asked whether individual glomeruli have the capacity for stimulus-evoked plasticity by focusing on the carbon dioxide (CO2) circuit in Drosophila. Specialized OSNs detect this gas and relay the information to a dedicated circuit in the brain. Prolonged exposure to CO2 induced a reversible volume increase in the CO2-specific glomerulus. OSNs showed neither altered morphology nor function after chronic exposure, but one class of inhibitory local interneurons showed significantly increased responses to CO2. Two-photon imaging of the axon terminals of a single PN innervating the CO2 glomerulus showed significantly decreased functional output following CO2 exposure. Behavioral responses to CO2 were also reduced after such exposure. We suggest that activity-dependent functional plasticity may be a general feature of the Drosophila olfactory system.

AB  - Summary
In the cortex, synaptic latencies display small variations (∼1–2 ms) that are generally considered to be negligible. We show here that the synaptic latency at monosynaptically connected pairs of L5 and CA3 pyramidal neurons is determined by the presynaptic release probability (Pr): synaptic latency being inversely correlated with the amplitude of the postsynaptic current and sensitive to manipulations of Pr. Changes in synaptic latency were also observed when Pr was physiologically regulated in short- and long-term synaptic plasticity. Paired-pulse depression and facilitation were respectively associated with increased and decreased synaptic latencies. Similarly, latencies were prolonged following induction of presynaptic LTD and reduced after LTP induction. We show using the dynamic-clamp technique that the observed covariation in latency and synaptic strength is a synergistic combination that significantly affects postsynaptic spiking. In conclusion, amplitude-related variation in latency represents a putative code for short- and long-term synaptic dynamics in cortical networks.

AB  - Summary
The intrinsic period of circadian clocks is their defining adaptive property. To identify the biochemical mechanisms whereby casein kinase1 (CK1) determines circadian period in mammals, we created mouse null and tau mutants of Ck1 epsilon. Circadian period lengthened in CK1ɛ−/−, whereas CK1ɛtau/tau shortened circadian period of behavior in vivo and suprachiasmatic nucleus firing rates in vitro, by accelerating PERIOD-dependent molecular feedback loops. CK1ɛtau/tau also accelerated molecular oscillations in peripheral tissues, revealing its global role in circadian pacemaking. CK1ɛtau acted by promoting degradation of both nuclear and cytoplasmic PERIOD, but not CRYPTOCHROME, proteins. Together, these whole-animal and biochemical studies explain how tau, as a gain-of-function mutation, acts at a specific circadian phase to promote degradation of PERIOD proteins and thereby accelerate the mammalian clockwork in brain and periphery.

AB  - Summary
The organization of primary visual cortex (V1) into functional maps makes individual cells operate in a variety of contexts. For instance, some neurons lie in regions of fairly homogeneous orientation preference (iso-orientation domains), while others lie in regions with a variety of preferences (e.g., pinwheel centers). We asked whether this diversity in local map structure correlates with the degree of selectivity of spike responses. We used a combination of imaging and electrophysiology to reveal that neurons in regions of homogeneous orientation preference have much sharper tuning. Moreover, in both monkeys and cats, a common principle links the structure of the orientation map, on the spatial scale of dendritic integration, to the degree of selectivity of individual cells. We conclude that neural computation is not invariant across the cortical surface. This finding must factor into future theories of receptive field wiring and map development.

In this issue of Neuron, Navalpakkam and Itti take a computational approach to show that this strategy is actually very inefficient when the target is surrounded by distractors with similar features. Instead, the optimal strategy is to boost the activity of neurons that best discriminate between target and distractors, while essentially ignoring the neurons that respond best to the target.

AB  - Summary
There has never been a wholesale way of identifying neurons that are monosynaptically connected either to some other cell group or, especially, to a single cell. The best available tools, transsynaptic tracers, are unable to distinguish weak direct connections from strong indirect ones. Furthermore, no tracer has proven potent enough to label any connected neurons whatsoever when starting from a single cell. Here we present a transsynaptic tracer that crosses only one synaptic step, unambiguously identifying cells directly presynaptic to the starting population. Based on rabies virus, it is genetically targetable, allows high-level expression of any gene of interest in the synaptically coupled neurons, and robustly labels connections made to single cells. This technology should enable a far more detailed understanding of neural connectivity than has previously been possible.

AB  - Summary
A fundamental property of circadian rhythms is their ability to persist under constant conditions. In Drosophila, the ventral Lateral Neurons (LNvs) are the pacemaker neurons driving circadian behavior under constant darkness. Wild-type flies are arrhythmic under constant illumination, but flies defective for the circadian photoreceptor CRY remain rhythmic. We found that flies overexpressing the pacemaker gene per or the morgue gene are also behaviorally rhythmic under constant light. Unexpectedly, the LNvs do not drive these rhythms: they are molecularly arrhythmic, and PDF—the neuropeptide they secrete to synchronize behavioral rhythms under constant darkness—is dispensable for rhythmicity in constant light. Molecular circadian rhythms are only found in a group of Dorsal Neurons: the DN1s. Thus, a subset of Dorsal Neurons shares with the LNvs the ability to function as pacemakers for circadian behavior, and its importance is promoted by light.

AB  - Summary
Alternative splicing provides a means to increase the complexity of gene function in numerous biological processes, including nervous system wiring. Navigating axons switch responses from attraction to repulsion at intermediate targets, allowing them to grow to each intermediate target and then to move on. The mechanisms underlying this switch remain poorly characterized. We previously showed that the Slit receptor Robo3 is required for spinal commissural axons to enter and cross the midline intermediate target. We report here the existence of two functionally antagonistic isoforms of Robo3 with distinct carboxy termini arising from alternative splicing. Robo3.1 is deployed on the precrossing and crossing portions of commissural axons and allows midline crossing by silencing Slit repulsion. Robo3.2 becomes expressed on the postcrossing portion and blocks midline recrossing, favoring Slit repulsion. The tight spatial regulation of opponent splice variants helps ensure high-fidelity transition of axonal responses from attraction to repulsion at the midline.

AB  - Summary
In a forward genetic screen for mutations that destabilize the neuromuscular junction, we identified a novel long isoform of Drosophila ankyrin2 (ank2-L). We demonstrate that loss of presynaptic Ank2-L not only causes synapse disassembly and retraction but also disrupts neuronal excitability and NMJ morphology. We provide genetic evidence that ank2-L is necessary to generate the membrane constrictions that normally separate individual synaptic boutons and is necessary to achieve the normal spacing of subsynaptic protein domains, including the normal organization of synaptic cell adhesion molecules. Mechanistically, synapse organization is correlated with a lattice-like organization of Ank2-L, visualized using extended high-resolution structured-illumination microscopy. The stabilizing functions of Ank2-L can be mapped to the extended C-terminal domain that we demonstrate can directly bind and organize synaptic microtubules. We propose that a presynaptic Ank2-L lattice links synaptic membrane proteins and spectrin to the underlying microtubule cytoskeleton to organize and stabilize the presynaptic terminal.

AB  - Summary
The neuropeptide PDF is released by sixteen clock neurons in Drosophila and helps maintain circadian activity rhythms by coordinating a network of ∼150 neuronal clocks. Whether PDF acts directly on elements of this neural network remains unknown. We address this question by adapting Epac1-camps, a genetically encoded cAMP FRET sensor, for use in the living brain. We find that a subset of the PDF-expressing neurons respond to PDF with long-lasting cAMP increases and confirm that such responses require the PDF receptor. In contrast, an unrelated Drosophila neuropeptide, DH31, stimulates large cAMP increases in all PDF-expressing clock neurons. Thus, the network of ∼150 clock neurons displays widespread, though not uniform, PDF receptivity. This work introduces a sensitive means of measuring cAMP changes in a living brain with subcellular resolution. Specifically, it experimentally confirms the longstanding hypothesis that PDF is a direct modulator of most neurons in the Drosophila clock network.

AB  - Summary
Food palatability and hedonic value play central roles in nutrient intake. However, postingestive effects can influence food preferences independently of palatability, although the neurobiological bases of such mechanisms remain poorly understood. Of central interest is whether the same brain reward circuitry that is responsive to palatable rewards also encodes metabolic value independently of taste signaling. Here we show that trpm5−/− mice, which lack the cellular machinery required for sweet taste transduction, can develop a robust preference for sucrose solutions based solely on caloric content. Sucrose intake induced dopamine release in the ventral striatum of these sweet-blind mice, a pattern usually associated with receipt of palatable rewards. Furthermore, single neurons in this same ventral striatal region showed increased sensitivity to caloric intake even in the absence of gustatory inputs. Our findings suggest that calorie-rich nutrients can directly influence brain reward circuits that control food intake independently of palatability or functional taste transduction.

AB  - Summary
Motile dendritic filopodial processes are thought to be precursors of spine synapses, but how motility relates to cell-surface cues required for axon-dendrite recognition and synaptogenesis remains unclear. We demonstrate with dynamic imaging that loss of EphBs results in reduced motility of filopodia in cultured cortical neurons and brain slice. EphB knockdown and rescue experiments during different developmental time windows show that EphBs are required for synaptogenesis only when filopodia are most abundant and motile. In the context of EphB knockdown and reduced filopodia motility, independent rescue of either motility with PAK or of Eph-ephrin binding with an EphB2 kinase mutant is not sufficient to restore synapse formation. Strikingly, the combination of PAK and kinase-inactive EphB2 rescues synaptogenesis. Deletion of the ephrin-binding domain from EphB2 precludes rescue, indicating that both motility and trans-cellular interactions are required. Our findings provide a mechanistic link between dendritic filopodia motility and synapse differentiation.

AB  - Summary
Homeostatic synaptic scaling adjusts a neuron's excitatory synaptic strengths up or down to compensate for perturbations in activity. Little is known about the molecular pathway(s) involved, nor is it clear which aspect of “activity”—local synaptic signaling, postsynaptic firing, or large-scale changes in network activity—is required to induce synaptic scaling. Here, we selectively block either postsynaptic firing in individual neurons or a fraction of presynaptic inputs, while optically monitoring changes in synaptic strength. We find that synaptic scaling is rapidly induced by block of postsynaptic firing, but not by local synaptic blockade, and is mediated through a drop in somatic calcium influx, reduced activation of CaMKIV, and an increase in transcription. Cortical neurons thus homeostatically adjust synaptic strengths in response to changes in their own firing rate, a mechanism with the computational advantage of efficiently normalizing synaptic strengths without interfering with synapse-specific mechanisms of information storage.

AB  - In Drosophila, the neuropeptide PDF is required for circadian rhythmicity, but it is unclear where PDF acts. In this issue of Neuron, Shafer et al. use a novel bioimaging methodology to demonstrate that PDF elevates cAMP in nearly all clock neurons. Thus, PDF apparently exerts more widespread effects on the circadian clock network than suggested by previous studies of PDF receptor expression.

AB  - Summary
Central processing of acoustic cues is critically dependent on the balance between excitation and inhibition. This balance is particularly important for auditory neurons in the lateral superior olive, because these compare excitatory inputs from one ear and inhibitory inputs from the other ear to compute sound source location. By applying GABAB receptor antagonists during sound stimulation in vivo, it was revealed that these neurons adjust their binaural sensitivity through GABAB receptors. Using an in vitro approach, we then demonstrate that these neurons release GABA during spiking activity. Consequently, GABA differentially regulates transmitter release from the excitatory and inhibitory terminals via feedback to presynaptic GABAB receptors. Modulation of the synaptic input strength, by putative retrograde release of neurotransmitter, may enable these auditory neurons to rapidly adjust the balance between excitation and inhibition, and thus their binaural sensitivity, which could play an important role as an adaptation to various listening situations.

AB  - Summary
Establishing what information is actively maintained in working memory (WM) and how it is represented and controlled is essential to understanding how such information guides future behavior. WM has traditionally been investigated in terms of the maintenance of stimulus-specific information, such as locations or words. More recently, investigators have emphasized the importance of rules that establish relationships between those stimuli and the pending response. The current study used a mental arithmetic task with fMRI to test whether updating of numbers (i.e., stimuli) and updating of mathematical operations (i.e., rules) in WM relies on the same neural system. Results indicate that, while a common network is activated by both types of updating, rule updating preferentially activates prefrontal cortex while number updating preferentially activates parietal cortex. The results suggest that both numbers and rules are maintained in WM but that they are different types of information that are controlled independently.

AB  - Summary
Perception is usually an active process by which action selects and affects sensory information. During rodent active touch, whisker kinematics influences how objects activate sensory receptors. In order to fully characterize whisker motion, we reconstructed whisker position in 3D and decomposed whisker motion to all its degrees of freedom. We found that, across behavioral modes, in both head-fixed and freely moving rats, whisker motion is characterized by translational movements and three rotary components: azimuth, elevation, and torsion. Whisker torsion, which has not previously been described, was large (up to 100°), and torsional angles were highly correlated with whisker azimuths. The coupling of azimuth and torsion was consistent across whisking epochs and rats and was similar along rows but systematically varied across rows such that rows A and E counterrotated. Torsional rotation of the whiskers enables contact information to be mapped onto the circumference of the whisker follicles in a predictable manner across protraction-retraction cycles.

AB  - Summary
The induced gamma-band EEG response (iGBR) recorded on the scalp is widely assumed to reflect synchronous neural oscillation associated with object representation, attention, memory, and consciousness. The most commonly reported EEG iGBR is a broadband transient increase in power at the gamma range ∼200–300 ms following stimulus onset. A conspicuous feature of this iGBR is the trial-to-trial poststimulus latency variability, which has been insufficiently addressed. Here, we show, using single-trial analysis of concomitant EEG and eye tracking, that this iGBR is tightly time locked to the onset of involuntary miniature eye movements and reflects a saccadic “spike potential.” The time course of the iGBR is related to an increase in the rate of saccades following a period of poststimulus saccadic inhibition. Thus, whereas neuronal gamma-band oscillations were shown conclusively with other methods, the broadband transient iGBR recorded by scalp EEG reflects properties of miniature saccade dynamics rather than neuronal oscillations.

AB  - Summary
The presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) mGluR7 modulates excitatory neurotransmission by regulating neurotransmitter release and plays a critical role in certain forms of synaptic plasticity. Although the dynamic regulation of mGluR7 surface expression governs a form of metaplasticity in the hippocampus, little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating mGluR7 trafficking. We now show that mGluR7 surface expression is stabilized by both PKC phosphorylation and by receptor binding to the PDZ domain-containing protein PICK1. Phosphorylation of mGluR7 on serine 862 (S862) inhibits CaM binding, thereby increasing mGluR7 surface expression and receptor binding to PICK1. Furthermore, in mice lacking PICK1, PKC-dependent increases in mGluR7 phosphorylation and surface expression are diminished, and mGluR7-dependent plasticity at mossy fiber-interneuron hippocampal synapses is impaired. These data support a model in which PICK1 binding and PKC phosphorylation act together to stabilize mGluR7 on the cell surface in vivo.

AB  - Summary
AP-4 is a member of the adaptor protein complexes, which control vesicular trafficking of membrane proteins. Although AP-4 has been suggested to contribute to basolateral sorting in epithelial cells, its function in neurons is unknown. Here, we show that disruption of the gene encoding the β subunit of AP-4 resulted in increased accumulation of axonal autophagosomes, which contained AMPA receptors and transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs), in axons of hippocampal neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells both in vitro and in vivo. AP-4 indirectly associated with the AMPA receptor via TARPs, and the specific disruption of the interaction between AP-4 and TARPs caused the mislocalization of endogenous AMPA receptors in axons of wild-type neurons. These results indicate that AP-4 may regulate proper somatodendritic-specific distribution of its cargo proteins, including AMPA receptor-TARP complexes and the autophagic pathway in neurons.

AB  - Summary
Increases in core body temperature promote thermoregulatory cooling by stimulating sweat production and preemptive renal water reabsorption through the release of vasopressin (VP, antidiuretic hormone). The mechanism by which the hypothalamus orchestrates this anticipatory VP release during hyperthermia is unknown but has been linked to a central thermosensory mechanism. Here, we report that thermal stimuli spanning core body temperatures activate a calcium-permeable, ruthenium red- and SB366791-sensitive nonselective cation conductance in hypothalamic VP neurons. This response is associated with a depolarizing receptor potential and an increase in action potential firing rate, indicating that these neurons are intrinsically thermosensitive. The thermosensitivity of VP neurons isolated from trpv1 knockout (Trpv1−/−) mice was significantly lower than that of wild-type counterparts. Moreover, Trpv1−/− mice showed an impaired VP response to hyperthermia in vivo. Channels encoded by the trpv1 gene thus confer thermosensitivity in central VP neurons and contribute to the thermal control of VP release in vivo.

AB  - Summary
Expression of the Notch effector gene Hes1 is required for maintenance of neural progenitors in the embryonic brain, but persistent and high levels of Hes1 expression inhibit proliferation and differentiation of these cells. Here, by using a real-time imaging method, we found that Hes1 expression dynamically oscillates in neural progenitors. Furthermore, sustained overexpression of Hes1 downregulates expression of proneural genes, Notch ligands, and cell cycle regulators, suggesting that their proper expression depends on Hes1 oscillation. Surprisingly, the proneural gene Neurogenin2 (Ngn2) and the Notch ligand Delta-like1 (Dll1) are also expressed in an oscillatory manner by neural progenitors, and inhibition of Notch signaling, a condition known to induce neuronal differentiation, leads to downregulation of Hes1 and sustained upregulation of Ngn2 and Dll1. These results suggest that Hes1 oscillation regulates Ngn2 and Dll1 oscillations, which in turn lead to maintenance of neural progenitors by mutual activation of Notch signaling.

Neural activity in the frontal eye fields controls smooth pursuit eye movements, but the relationship between single neuron responses, cortical population responses, and eye movements is not well understood. We describe an approach to dynamically link trial-to-trial fluctuations in neural responses to parallel variations in pursuit and demonstrate that individual neurons predict eye velocity fluctuations at particular moments during the course of behavior, while the population of neurons collectively tiles the entire duration of the movement. The analysis also reveals the strength of correlations in the eye movement predictions derived from pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons and suggests a simple model of cortical processing. These findings constrain the primate cortical code for movement, suggesting that either a few neurons are sufficient to drive pursuit at any given time or that many neurons operate collectively at each moment with remarkably little variation added to motor command signals downstream from the cortex.

AB  - Summary
Where we allocate our visual spatial attention depends upon a continual competition between internally generated goals and external distractions. Recently it was shown that single neurons in the macaque lateral intraparietal area (LIP) can predict the amount of time a distractor can shift the locus of spatial attention away from a goal. We propose that this remarkable dynamical correspondence between single neurons and attention can be explained by a network model in which generically high-dimensional firing-rate vectors rapidly decay to a single mode. We find direct experimental evidence for this model, not only in the original attentional task, but also in a very different task involving perceptual decision making. These results confirm a theoretical prediction that slowly varying activity patterns are proportional to spontaneous activity, pose constraints on models of persistent activity, and suggest a network mechanism for the emergence of robust behavioral timing from heterogeneous neuronal populations.

AB  - Summary
Mutations in presenilins (PS) are the major cause of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) and have been associated with calcium (Ca2+) signaling abnormalities. Here, we demonstrate that FAD mutant PS1 (M146L) and PS2 (N141I) interact with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) Ca2+ release channel and exert profound stimulatory effects on its gating activity in response to saturating and suboptimal levels of InsP3. These interactions result in exaggerated cellular Ca2+ signaling in response to agonist stimulation as well as enhanced low-level Ca2+ signaling in unstimulated cells. Parallel studies in InsP3R-expressing and -deficient cells revealed that enhanced Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum as a result of the specific interaction of PS1-M146L with the InsP3R stimulates amyloid beta processing, an important feature of AD pathology. These observations provide molecular insights into the “Ca2+ dysregulation” hypothesis of AD pathogenesis and suggest novel targets for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Summary
Patterns of coordinated spontaneous activity have been proposed to guide circuit refinement in many parts of the developing nervous system. It is unclear, however, how such patterns, which are thought to indiscriminately synchronize nearby cells, could provide the cues necessary to segregate functionally distinct circuits within overlapping cell populations. Here, we report that glutamatergic retinal waves possess a substructure in the bursting of neighboring retinal ganglion cells with opposite light responses (ON or OFF). Within a wave, cells fire repetitive nonoverlapping bursts in a fixed order: ON before OFF. This pattern is absent from cholinergic waves, which precede glutamate-dependent activity, providing a developmental sequence of distinct activity-encoded cues. Asynchronous bursting of ON and OFF retinal ganglion cells depends on inhibition between these parallel pathways. Similar asynchronous activity patterns could arise throughout the nervous system, as inhibition matures and might help to separate connections of functionally distinct subnetworks.

AB  - Summary
Cortical receptive fields represent the signal preferences of sensory neurons. Receptive fields are thought to provide a representation of sensory experience from which the cerebral cortex may make interpretations. While it is essential to determine a neuron's receptive field, it remains unclear which features of the acoustic environment are specifically represented by neurons in the primary auditory cortex (AI). We characterized cat AI spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) by finding both the spike-triggered average (STA) and stimulus dimensions that maximized the mutual information between response and stimulus. We derived a nonlinearity relating spiking to stimulus projection onto two maximally informative dimensions (MIDs). The STA was highly correlated with the first MID. Generally, the nonlinearity for the first MID was asymmetric and often monotonic in shape, while the second MID nonlinearity was symmetric and nonmonotonic. The joint nonlinearity for both MIDs revealed that most first and second MIDs were synergistic and thus should be considered conjointly. The difference between the nonlinearities suggests different possible roles for the MIDs in auditory processing.

Serum response factor (SRF) is a prototypic transcription factor that mediates stimulus-dependent gene expression. Here, we show that SRF mediates NGF signaling, axonal growth, branching, and target innervation by embryonic DRG sensory neurons. Conditional deletion of the murine SRF gene in DRGs results in no deficits in neuronal viability or differentiation but causes defects in extension and arborization of peripheral axonal projections in the target field in vivo, similar to the target innervation defects observed in mice lacking NGF. Moreover, SRF is both necessary and sufficient for NGF-dependent axonal outgrowth in vitro, and NGF regulates SRF-dependent gene expression and axonal outgrowth through activation of both MEK/ERK and MAL signaling pathways. These findings show that SRF is a major effector of both MEK/ERK and MAL signaling by NGF and that SRF is a key mediator of NGF-dependent target innervation by embryonic sensory neurons.

Here, we report that a member of the neuronal pentraxin (NP) family, neuronal pentraxin receptor (NPR), undergoes regulated cleavage by the MMP tumor necrosis factor-α converting enzyme (TACE). NPR is enriched at excitatory synapses where it associates with AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPAR) and enhances synaptogenesis. However, in response to activation of group 1 mGluRs (mGluR1/5), TACE cleaves NPR and releases the pentraxin domain from its N-terminal transmembrane domain. Cleaved NPR rapidly accumulates in endosomes where it colocalizes with AMPAR. This process is necessary for mGluR1/5-dependent LTD in hippocampal and cerebellar synapses. These observations suggest that cleaved NPR functions to “capture” AMPAR for endocytosis and reveal a bifunctional role of NPs in both synapse strengthening and weakening.

AB  - Summary
Dopamine signaling through D1 receptors in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a critical role in the maintenance of higher cognitive functions, such as working memory. At the cellular level, these functions are predicated to involve alterations in neuronal calcium levels. The dendrites of PFC neurons express D1 receptors and N-type calcium channels, yet little information exists regarding their coupling. Here, we show that D1 receptors potently inhibit N-type channels in dendrites of rat PFC neurons. Using coimmunoprecipitation, we demonstrate the existence of a D1 receptor-N-type channel signaling complex in this region, and we provide evidence for a direct receptor-channel interaction. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of this complex to receptor-channel colocalization in heterologous systems and in PFC neurons. Our data indicate that the N-type calcium channel is an important physiological target of D1 receptors and reveal a mechanism for D1 receptor-mediated regulation of cognitive function in the PFC.

The perception of visual depth is determined by integration of spatial disparities of inputs from the two eyes. Single cells in visual cortex of monkeys are known to respond to specific binocular disparities; however, little is known about their functional organization. We now show, using intrinsic signal optical imaging and single-unit physiology, that, in the thick stripe compartments of the second visual area (V2), there is a clustered organization of Near cells and Far cells, and moreover, there are topographic maps for Near to Far disparities within V2. Our findings suggest that maps for visual disparity are calculated in V2, and demonstrate parallels in functional organization between the thin, pale, and thick stripes of V2.

AB  - Summary
Fast-spiking cells (FS cells) are a prominent subtype of neocortical GABAergic interneurons with important functional roles. Multiple FS cell properties are coordinated for rapid response. Here, we describe an FS cell feature that serves to gate the powerful inhibition produced by FS cell activity. We show that FS cells in layer 2/3 barrel cortex possess a dampening mechanism mediated by Kv1.1-containing potassium channels localized to the axon initial segment. These channels powerfully regulate action potential threshold and allow FS cells to respond preferentially to large inputs that are fast enough to “outrun” Kv1 activation. In addition, Kv1.1 channel blockade converts the delay-type discharge pattern of FS cells to one of continuous fast spiking without influencing the high-frequency firing that defines FS cells. Thus, Kv1 channels provide a key counterbalance to the established rapid-response characteristics of FS cells, regulating excitability through a unique combination of electrophysiological properties and discrete subcellular localization.

AB  - Summary
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate the cerebral correlates of motor sequence memory consolidation. Participants were scanned while training on an implicit oculomotor sequence learning task and during a single testing session taking place 30 min, 5 hr, or 24 hr later. During training, responses observed in hippocampus and striatum were linearly related to the gain in performance observed overnight, but not over the day. Responses in both structures were significantly larger at 24 hr than at 30 min or 5 hr. Additionally, the competitive interaction observed between these structures during training became cooperative overnight. These results stress the importance of both hippocampus and striatum in procedural memory consolidation. Responses in these areas during training seem to condition the overnight memory processing that is associated with a change in their functional interactions. These results show that both structures interact during motor sequence consolidation to optimize subsequent behavior.

AB  - Summary
Flexible behavior in humans often requires that rapid choices be made between conflicting action plans. Although much attention has focused on prefrontal regions, little is understood about the contribution of parietal cortex under situations of response conflict. Here we show that right parietal damage associated with spatial neglect leads to paradoxical facilitation (speeding) of rightward movements in the presence of conflicting leftward response plans. These findings indicate a critical role for parietal regions in action planning when there is response competition. In contrast, patients with prefrontal damage have an augmented cost of conflict for both leftward and rightward movements. The results suggest involvement of two independent systems in situations of response conflict, with right parietal cortex being a crucial site for automatic activation of competing motor plans and prefrontal regions acting independently to inhibit action plans irrelevant to current task goals.

AB  - Summary
The mechanisms by which proneural basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factors control neurogenesis have been characterized, but it is not known how they specify neuronal cell-type identity. Here, we provide evidence that two conserved serine residues on the bHLH factor neurogenin 2 (Ngn2), S231 and S234, are phosphorylated during motor neuron differentiation. In knockin mice in which S231 and S234 of Ngn2 were mutated to alanines, neurogenesis occurs normally, but motor neuron specification is impaired. The phosphorylation of Ngn2 at S231 and S234 facilitates the interaction of Ngn2 with LIM homeodomain transcription factors to specify motor neuron identity. The phosphorylation-dependent cooperativity between Ngn2 and homeodomain transcription factors may be a general mechanism by which the activities of bHLH and homeodomain proteins are temporally and spatially integrated to generate the wide diversity of cell types that are a hallmark of the nervous system.

AB  - Summary
Neural firing discharges are often temporally patterned, but it is often ambiguous as to whether the temporal features of these patterns constitute a useful code. Here we show in the mouse olfactory bulb that ensembles of projection neurons respond with complex odor- and concentration-specific dynamic activity sequences developing below and above sniffing frequency. Based on this activity, almost optimal discrimination of presented odors was possible during single sniffs, consistent with reported behavioral data. Within a sniff cycle, slower features of the dynamics alone (&gt;100 ms resolution, including mean firing rate) were sufficient for maximal discrimination. A smaller amount of information was also observed in faster features down to 20–40 ms resolution. Therefore, mitral cell ensemble activity contains information at different timescales that could be separately or complementarily exploited by downstream brain centers to make odor discriminations. Our results also support suggestive analogies in the dynamics of odor representations between insects and mammals.

AB  - Summary
In the cerebral cortex, GABAergic interneurons are often regarded as fast-spiking cells. We have identified a type of slow-spiking interneuron that offers distinct contributions to network activity. “Ivy” cells, named after their dense and fine axons innervating mostly basal and oblique pyramidal cell dendrites, are more numerous than the parvalbumin-expressing basket, bistratified, or axo-axonic cells. Ivy cells express nitric oxide synthase, neuropeptide Y, and high levels of GABAA receptor α1 subunit; they discharge at a low frequency with wide spikes in vivo, yet are distinctively phase-locked to behaviorally relevant network rhythms including theta, gamma, and ripple oscillations. Paired recordings in vitro showed that Ivy cells receive depressing EPSPs from pyramidal cells, which in turn receive slowly rising and decaying inhibitory input from Ivy cells. In contrast to fast-spiking interneurons operating with millisecond precision, the highly abundant Ivy cells express presynaptically acting neuromodulators and regulate the excitability of pyramidal cell dendrites through slowly rising and decaying GABAergic inputs.

AB  - Summary
Here we describe the properties of a synapse in the Drosophila antennal lobe and show how they can explain certain sensory computations in this brain region. The synapse between olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and projection neurons (PNs) is very strong, reflecting a large number of release sites and high release probability. This is likely one reason why weak ORN odor responses are amplified in PNs. Furthermore, the amplitude of unitary synaptic currents in a PN is matched to the size of its dendritic arbor. This matching may compensate for a lower input resistance of larger dendrites to produce uniform depolarization across PN types. Consistent with this idea, a genetic manipulation that lowers input resistance increases unitary synaptic currents. Finally, strong stimuli produce short-term depression at this synapse. This helps explain why PN odor responses are transient, and why strong ORN odor responses are not amplified as powerfully as weak responses.

While most studies have focused on the role of long-term potentiation in behavior, far less is known about the role of long-term depression (LTD). To examine the potential involvement of LTD in learning and memory, we generated transgenic mice that express a fragment of the SV40 small t antigen known to inhibit protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Small t antigen expression blocked both stimulus-induced and chemically induced NMDAR-dependent LTD at Schaffer collateral synapses but did not affect potentiation, depotentiation, or mGluR-dependent LTD. This physiological phenotype was associated with deficits in behavioral flexibility in both the Morris water maze and a delayed nonmatch to place T-maze task, suggesting that NMDAR-dependent LTD is required for behavioral flexibility and may act by weakening previously encoded memory traces when new information is learned.

AB  - Summary
GABA synapses play a critical role in many aspects of circuit development and function. For example, conditions that perturb GABA transmission have been implicated in epilepsy. To identify genes that regulate GABA transmission, we performed an RNAi screen for genes whose inactivation increases the activity of C. elegans body muscles, which receive direct input from GABAergic motor neurons. We identified 90 genes, 21 of which were previously implicated in seizure syndromes, suggesting that this screen has effectively identified candidate genes for epilepsy. Electrophysiological recordings and imaging of excitatory and inhibitory synapses indicate that several genes alter muscle activity by selectively regulating GABA transmission. In particular, we identify two humoral pathways and several protein kinases that modulate GABA transmission but have little effect on excitatory transmission at cholinergic neuromuscular junctions. Our data suggest these conserved genes are components of signaling pathways that regulate GABA transmission and consequently may play a role in epilepsy and other cognitive or psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Summary
The ocular dominance (OD) shift that occurs in visual cortex after brief monocular deprivation (MD) is a classic model of experience-dependent cortical plasticity. It has been suggested that OD plasticity in layer 2/3 of visual cortex precedes and is necessary for plasticity in the thalamocortical input layer 4. Here, we show in mouse visual cortex that rapid OD plasticity occurs simultaneously in layers 2/3 and 4. Remarkably, pharmacological blockade of cannabinoid receptors completely prevents the OD shift in layer 2/3, leaving plasticity intact in layer 4. Thus, experience-dependent cortical modifications in layers 2/3 and 4 can occur in parallel, via distinct mechanisms. These findings simplify the mechanistic description of plasticity in layer 4, force a revision in the interpretation of previous studies in which laminar differences in OD plasticity mechanisms were unrecognized, and have important implications for the therapeutic use of cannabinoid receptor antagonists in humans.

Choosing the most valuable course of action requires knowing the outcomes associated with the available alternatives. The striatum may be important for representing the values of actions. We examined this in monkeys performing an oculomotor choice task. The activity of phasically active neurons (PANs) in the striatum covaried with two classes of information: action-values and chosen-values. Action-value PANs were correlated with value estimates for one of the available actions, and these signals were frequently observed before movement execution. Chosen-value PANs were correlated with the value of the action that had been chosen, and these signals were primarily observed later in the task, immediately before or persistently after movement execution. These populations may serve distinct functions mediated by the striatum: some PANs may participate in choice by encoding the values of the available actions, while other PANs may participate in evaluative updating by encoding the reward value of chosen actions.

AB  - Summary
The modifications occurring in the brain during learning and memory are still poorly understood but may involve long-lasting changes in synaptic transmission (synaptic plasticity). In perirhinal cortex, a lasting decrement in neuronal responsiveness is associated with visual familiarity discrimination, leading to the hypothesis that long-term depression (LTD)-like synaptic plasticity may underlie recognition memory. LTD relies on internalization of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) through interaction between their GluR2 subunits and AP2, the clathrin adaptor protein required for endocytosis. We demonstrate that a peptide that blocks interactions between GluR2 and AP2 blocks LTD in perirhinal cortex in vitro. Viral transduction of this peptide in perirhinal cortex produced striking deficits in visual recognition memory. Furthermore, there was a deficit of LTD in perirhinal cortex slices from virally transduced, recognition memory-deficient animals. These results suggest that internalization of AMPA receptors, a process critical for the expression of LTD in perirhinal cortex, underlies visual recognition memory.

AB  - Summary
Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5) has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of p25, an activator of cdk5, led to increased levels of BACE1 mRNA and protein in vitro and in vivo. A p25/cdk5 responsive region containing multiple sites for signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT1/3) was identified in the BACE1 promoter. STAT3 interacts with the BACE1 promoter, and p25-overexpressing mice had elevated levels of pSTAT3 and BACE1, whereas cdk5-deficient mice had reduced levels. Furthermore, mice with a targeted mutation in the STAT3 cdk5 responsive site had lower levels of BACE1. Increased BACE levels in p25 overexpressing mice correlated with enhanced amyloidogenic processing that could be reversed by a cdk5 inhibitor. These data demonstrate a pathway by which p25/cdk5 increases the amyloidogenic processing of APP through STAT3-mediated transcriptional control of BACE1 that could have implications for AD pathogenesis.

Here, Wheeler and colleagues show that drug-associated cues come to activate neural representations of aversive information in nucleus accumbens and that this activation predicts subsequent drug use. These remarkable data identify a potential neural substrate through which aversive affective representations may motivate drug use.

AB  - Summary
It is a central tenet of cochlear neurobiology that mammalian ears rely on a local, mechanical amplification process for their high sensitivity and sharp frequency selectivity. While it is generally agreed that outer hair cells provide the amplification, two mechanisms have been proposed: stereociliary motility and somatic motility. The latter is driven by the motor protein prestin. Electrophysiological phenotyping of a prestin knockout mouse intimated that somatic motility is the amplifier. However, outer hair cells of knockout mice have significantly altered mechanical properties, making this mouse model unsatisfactory. Here, we study a mouse model without alteration to outer hair cell and organ of Corti mechanics or to mechanoelectric transduction, but with diminished prestin function. These animals have knockout-like behavior, demonstrating that prestin-based electromotility is required for cochlear amplification.

AB  - Summary
Ca2+/calmodulin-mediated negative feedback is a prototypical regulatory mechanism for Ca2+-permeable ion channels. In olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), such regulation on the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel is considered a major mechanism of OSN adaptation. To determine the role of Ca2+/calmodulin desensitization of the olfactory CNG channel, we introduced a mutation in the channel subunit CNGB1b in mice that rendered the channel resistant to fast desensitization by Ca2+/calmodulin. Contrary to expectations, mutant OSNs showed normal receptor current adaptation to repeated stimulation. Rather, they displayed slower response termination and, consequently, reduced ability to transmit olfactory information to the olfactory bulb. They also displayed reduced response decline during sustained odorant exposure. These results suggest that Ca2+/calmodulin-mediated CNG channel fast desensitization is less important in regulating the sensitivity to recurring stimulation than previously thought and instead functions primarily to terminate OSN responses.

AB  - Summary
Cannabinoid receptors play key roles in brain function, and cannabinoid effects in brain physiology and drug-related behavior are thought to be mediated by receptors present in neurons. Neuron-astrocyte communication relies on the expression by astrocytes of neurotransmitter receptors. Yet, the expression of cannabinoid receptors by astrocytes in situ and their involvement in the neuron-astrocyte communication remain largely unknown. We show that hippocampal astrocytes express CB1 receptors that upon activation lead to phospholipase C-dependent Ca2+ mobilization from internal stores. These receptors are activated by endocannabinoids released by neurons, increasing astrocyte Ca2+ levels, which stimulate glutamate release that activates NMDA receptors in pyramidal neurons. These results demonstrate the existence of endocannabinoid-mediated neuron-astrocyte communication, revealing that astrocytes are targets of cannabinoids and might therefore participate in the physiology of cannabinoid-related addiction. They also reveal the existence of an endocannabinoid-glutamate signaling pathway where astrocytes serve as a bridge for nonsynaptic interneuronal communication.

AB  - Summary
The naturally occurring sex difference in dendritic spine number on hypothalamic neurons offers a unique opportunity to investigate mechanisms establishing synaptic patterning during perinatal sensitive periods. A major advantage of the rat as a model of sexual differentiation is that treatment of neonatal females with estradiol will permanently induce the male phenotype. During the development of other systems, exuberant innervation is followed by activity-dependent pruning necessary for elimination of spurious synapses. In contrast, we demonstrate that estradiol-induced organization in the hypothalamus involves the induction of new synapses on dendritic spines. Activation of estrogen receptors by estradiol triggers a nongenomic activation of PI3 kinase that results in enhanced glutamate release from presynaptic neurons. Subsequent activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors activates MAP kinases, thereby inducing dendritic spine formation. These results reveal a transneuronal mechanism by which estradiol acts during a sensitive period to establish a profound and lasting sex difference in hypothalamic synaptic patterning.

AB  - Summary
Many species of mammals are very good at categorizing odors. One model for how this is achieved involves the formation of “attractor” states in the olfactory processing pathway, which converge to stable representations for the odor. We analyzed the responses of rat olfactory bulb mitral/tufted (M/T) cells using stimuli “morphing” from one odor to another through intermediate mixtures. We then developed a phenomenological model for the representation of odors and mixtures by M/T cells and show that &gt;80% of odorant responses to different concentrations and mixtures can be expressed in terms of smoothly summing responses to air and the two pure odorants. Furthermore, the model successfully predicts M/T cell responses to odor mixtures when respiration dependence is eliminated. Thus, odor mixtures are represented in the bulb through summation of components, rather than distinct attractor states. We suggest that our olfactory coding model captures many aspects of single and mixed odor representation in M/T cells.

AB  - Summary
Cortical pyramidal neurons alter their responses to input signals depending on behavioral state. We investigated whether changes in somatic inhibition contribute to these alterations. In layer 5 pyramidal neurons of rat visual cortex, repetitive firing from a depolarized membrane potential, which typically occurs during arousal, produced long-lasting depression of somatic inhibition. In contrast, slow membrane oscillations with firing in the depolarized phase, which typically occurs during slow-wave sleep, produced long-lasting potentiation. The depression is mediated by L-type Ca2+ channels and GABAA receptor endocytosis, whereas potentiation is mediated by R-type Ca2+ channels and receptor exocytosis. It is likely that the direction of modification is mainly dependent on the ratio of R- and L-type Ca2+ channel activation. Furthermore, somatic inhibition was stronger in slices prepared from rats during slow-wave sleep than arousal. This bidirectional modification of somatic inhibition may alter pyramidal neuron responsiveness in accordance with behavioral state.

AB  - Summary
Adaptation or gain control allows sensory neurons to encode diverse stimuli using a limited range of output signals. Rod vision exemplifies a general challenge facing adaptational mechanisms—balancing the benefits of averaging to create a reliable signal for adaptation with the need to adapt rapidly and locally. The synapse between rod bipolar and AII amacrine cells dominates adaptation at low light levels. We find that adaptation occurs independently at each synapse and completes in &lt;500 ms. This limited spatial and temporal integration suggests that the absorption of a single photon modulates gain. Indeed, responses to pairs of brief dim flashes showed directly that synaptic gain was depressed for 100–200 ms following transmission of a single-photon response. Presynaptic mechanisms mediated this synaptic depression. Thus, the division of light into discrete photons controls adaptation at this synapse, and gain varies with the irreducible statistical fluctuations in photon arrival.

AB  - Summary
Notch signaling is critical for the stemness of radial glial cells (RGCs) during embryonic neurogenesis. Although Notch-signal-receiving events in RGCs have been well characterized, the signal-sending mechanism by the adjacent cells is poorly understood. Here, we report that conditional inactivation of mind bomb-1 (mib1), an essential component for Notch ligand endocytosis, in mice using the nestin and hGFAP promoters resulted in complete loss of Notch activation, which leads to depletion of RGCs, and premature differentiation into intermediate progenitors (IPs) and finally neurons, which were reverted by the introduction of active Notch1. Interestingly, Mib1 expression is restricted in the migrating IPs and newborn neurons, but not in RGCs. Moreover, sorted Mib1+ IPs and neurons can send the Notch signal to neighboring cells. Our results reveal that not only newborn neurons but also IPs are essential Notch-ligand-presenting cells for maintaining RGC stemness during both symmetric and asymmetric divisions.

Unraveling the functions of the diverse neural types in any local circuit ultimately requires methods to record from most or all of its cells simultaneously. One promising approach to this goal is fluorescence imaging, but existing methods using laser-scanning microscopy (LSM) are severely limited in their ability to resolve rapid phenomena, like neuronal action potentials, over wide fields. Here we present a microscope that rapidly sections a three-dimensional volume using a thin illumination sheet whose position is rigidly coupled to the objective and aligned with its focal plane. We demonstrate that this approach allows exceptionally low-noise imaging of large neuronal populations at pixel rates at least 100-fold higher than with LSM. Using this microscope, we studied the pheromone-sensing neurons of the mouse vomeronasal organ and found that responses to dilute urine are largely or exclusively restricted to cells in the apical layer, the location of V1r-family-expressing neurons.

AB  - Summary
In both mammals and insects, neurons involved in learning are strongly modulated by the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. The GABAA receptor, resistance to dieldrin (Rdl), is highly expressed in the Drosophila mushroom bodies (MBs), a group of neurons playing essential roles in insect olfactory learning. Flies with increased or decreased expression of Rdl in the MBs were generated. Olfactory associative learning tests showed that Rdl overexpression impaired memory acquisition but not memory stability. This learning defect was due to disrupting the physiological state of the adult MB neurons rather than causing developmental abnormalities. Remarkably, Rdl knockdown enhanced memory acquisition but not memory stability. Functional cellular imaging experiments showed that Rdl overexpression abolished the normal calcium responses of the MBs to odors while Rdl knockdown increased these responses. Together, these data suggest that RDL negatively modulates olfactory associative learning, possibly by gating the input of olfactory information into the MBs.

AB  - To date, most hypotheses of memory storage in the mammalian brain have focused upon long-term synaptic potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD) of fast glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). In recent years, it has become clear that many additional electrophysiological components of neurons, from electrical synapses to glutamate transporters to voltage-sensitive ion channels, can also undergo use-dependent long-term plasticity. Models of memory storage that incorporate this full range of demonstrated electrophysiological plasticity are better able to account for both the storage of memory in neuronal networks and the complexities of memory storage, indexing, and recall as measured behaviorally.

AB  - Summary
Homeostatic regulation of energy balance in rodents changes dramatically during the first 3 postnatal weeks. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and melanocortin neurons in the arcuate nucleus, a primary energy homeostatic center in adults, do not fully innervate the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) until the third postnatal week. We have identified two classes of PVN neurons responsive to these neuropeptides, tonically firing neurosecretory (NS) and burst-firing preautonomic (PA) cells. In neonates, NPY could inhibit GABAergic inputs to nearly all NS and PA neurons, while melanocortin regulation was minimal. However, there was a dramatic, age-dependent decrease in NPY responses specifically in the PA neurons, and a 3-fold increase in melanocortin responses in NS cells. These age-dependent changes were accompanied by changes in spontaneous GABAergic currents onto these neurons. This primarily NPYergic regulation in the neonates likely promotes the positive energy balance necessary for growth, while the developmental switch correlates with maturation of homeostatic regulation of energy balance.

AB  - Summary
Commissural axons are attracted to the midline intermediate target by chemoattractants, but upon crossing the midline they switch off responsiveness to attractants and switch on responsiveness to midline repellents, which expel the axons from the midline and enable them to move on. Here we show that midline exit also requires the stimulation of axon outgrowth by Stem Cell Factor (SCF, also known as Steel Factor). SCF is expressed by midline floor plate cells, and its receptor Kit, a receptor tyrosine kinase, is expressed by commissural axons. In Steel and Kit mutant mice, the majority of commissural axons line up transiently at the contralateral edge of the floor plate, showing a delay in midline exit. In vitro, SCF selectively promotes outgrowth of postcrossing, but not precrossing, commissural axons. Our findings identify SCF as a guidance cue in the CNS, and provide evidence that exiting intermediate targets requires activation of outgrowth-promoting mechanisms.

AB  - Summary
Sensory processing in the brain is thought to have evolved to encode naturally occurring stimuli efficiently. We report an adaptation in binocular cortical neurons that reflects the tight constraints imposed by the geometry of 3D vision. We show that the widely used binocular energy model predicts that neurons dedicate part of their dynamic range to impossible combinations of left and right images. Approximately 42% of the neurons we record from V1 of awake monkeys behave in this way (a powerful confirmation of the model), while about 58% deviate from the model in a manner that concentrates more of their dynamic range on stimuli that obey the constraints of binocular geometry. We propose a simple extension of the energy model, using multiple subunits, that explains the adaptation we observe, as well as other properties of binocular neurons that have been hard to account for, such as the response to anticorrelated stereograms.

AB  - Summary
Ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) subunits contain a large N-terminal domain (NTD) that precedes the agonist-binding domain (ABD) and participates in subunit oligomerization. In NMDA receptors (NMDARs), the NTDs of NR2A and NR2B subunits also form binding sites for the endogenous inhibitor Zn2+ ion. Although these allosteric sites have been characterized in detail, the molecular mechanisms by which the NTDs communicate with the rest of the receptor to promote its inhibition remain unknown. Here, we identify the ABD dimer interface as a major structural determinant that permits coupling between the NTDs and the channel gate. The strength of this interface also controls proton inhibition, another form of allosteric modulation of NMDARs. Conformational rearrangements at the ABD dimer interface thus appear to be a key mechanism conserved in all iGluR subfamilies, but have evolved to fulfill different functions: fast desensitization at AMPA and kainate receptors, allosteric inhibition at NMDARs.

AB  - Summary
Deletion of serine 63 from P0 glycoprotein (P0S63del) causes Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1B neuropathy in humans, and P0S63del produces a similar demyelinating neuropathy in transgenic mice. P0S63del is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and fails to be incorporated into myelin. Here we report that P0S63del is misfolded and Schwann cells mount a consequential canonical unfolded protein response (UPR), including expression of the transcription factor CHOP, previously associated with apoptosis in ER-stressed cells. UPR activation and CHOP expression respond dynamically to P0S63del levels and are reversible but are associated with only limited apoptosis of Schwann cells. Nonetheless, Chop ablation in S63del mice completely rescues their motor deficit and reduces active demyelination 2-fold. This indicates that signaling through the CHOP arm of the UPR provokes demyelination in inherited neuropathy. S63del mice also provide an opportunity to explore how cells can dysfunction yet survive in prolonged ER stress—important for neurodegeneration related to misfolded proteins.

AB  - The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a highly specialized brain endothelial structure of the fully differentiated neurovascular system. In concert with pericytes, astrocytes, and microglia, the BBB separates components of the circulating blood from neurons. Moreover, the BBB maintains the chemical composition of the neuronal “milieu,” which is required for proper functioning of neuronal circuits, synaptic transmission, synaptic remodeling, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis in the adult brain. BBB breakdown, due to disruption of the tight junctions, altered transport of molecules between blood and brain and brain and blood, aberrant angiogenesis, vessel regression, brain hypoperfusion, and inflammatory responses, may initiate and/or contribute to a “vicious circle” of the disease process, resulting in progressive synaptic and neuronal dysfunction and loss in disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and others. These findings support developments of new therapeutic approaches for chronic neurodegenerative disorders directed at the BBB and other nonneuronal cells of the neurovascular unit.

AB  - Summary
During Drosophila visual system development, photoreceptor (R) axons choose their correct paths and targets in a step-wise fashion. R axons with different identities make specific pathfinding decisions at different stages during development. We show here that the transmembrane protein Golden goal (Gogo), which is dynamically expressed in all R neurons and localizes predominantly to growth cones, is required in two distinct steps of R8 photoreceptor axon pathfinding: Gogo regulates axon-axon interactions and axon-target interactions in R8 photoreceptor axons. gogo loss-of-function and gain-of-function phenotypes suggest that Gogo mediates repulsive axon-axon interaction between R8 axons to maintain their proper spacing, and it promotes axon-target recognition at the temporary layer to enable R8 axons to enter their correct target columns in the medulla. From detailed structure-function experiments, we propose that Gogo functions as a receptor that binds an unidentified ligand through its conserved extracellular domain.

Here, we discuss these new findings in the context of our present understanding of cortical cell specification.

AB  - Summary
The molecular mechanisms controlling the development of distinct subtypes of neocortical projection neurons, and CNS neuronal diversity more broadly, are only now emerging. We report that the transcription factor SOX5 controls the sequential generation of distinct corticofugal neuron subtypes by preventing premature emergence of normally later-born corticofugal neurons. SOX5 loss-of-function causes striking overlap of the identities of the three principal sequentially born corticofugal neuron subtypes: subplate neurons, corticothalamic neurons, and subcerebral projection neurons. In Sox5−/− cortex, subplate neurons aberrantly develop molecular hallmarks and connectivity of subcerebral projection neurons; corticothalamic neurons are imprecisely differentiated, while differentiation of subcerebral projection neurons is accelerated. Gain-of-function analysis reinforces the critical role of SOX5 in controlling the sequential generation of corticofugal neurons—SOX5 overexpression at late stages of corticogenesis causes re-emergence of neurons with corticofugal features. These data indicate that SOX5 controls the timing of critical fate decisions during corticofugal neuron production and thus subtype-specific differentiation and neocortical neuron diversity.

AB  - Summary
Peripheral sensory organs provide the first transformation of sensory information, and understanding how their physical embodiment shapes transduction is central to understanding perception. We report the characterization of surface transduction during active sensing in the rodent vibrissa sensory system, a widely used model. Employing high-speed videography, we tracked vibrissae while rats sampled rough and smooth textures. Variation in vibrissa length predicted motion mean frequencies, including for the highest velocity events, indicating that biomechanics, such as vibrissa resonance, shape signals most likely to drive neural activity. Rough surface contact generated large amplitude, high-velocity “stick-slip-ring” events, while smooth surfaces generated smaller and more regular stick-slip oscillations. Both surfaces produced velocities exceeding those applied in reduced preparations, indicating active sensation of surfaces generates more robust drive than previously predicted. These findings demonstrate a key role for embodiment in vibrissal sensing and the importance of input transformations in sensory representation.

AB  - Summary
The topographic representation of visual space is preserved from retina to thalamus to cortex. We have previously shown that precise mapping of thalamocortical projections requires both molecular cues and structured retinal activity. To probe the interaction between these two mechanisms, we studied mice deficient in both ephrin-As and retinal waves. Functional and anatomical cortical maps in these mice were nearly abolished along the nasotemporal (azimuth) axis of the visual space. Both the structure of single-cell receptive fields and large-scale topography were severely distorted. These results demonstrate that ephrin-As and structured neuronal activity are two distinct pathways that mediate map formation in the visual cortex and together account almost completely for the formation of the azimuth map. Despite the dramatic disruption of azimuthal topography, the dorsoventral (elevation) map was relatively normal, indicating that the two axes of the cortical map are organized by separate mechanisms.

AB  - Summary
It is generally thought that transmitter release at mammalian central synapses is triggered by Ca2+ microdomains, implying loose coupling between presynaptic Ca2+ channels and Ca2+ sensors of exocytosis. Here we show that Ca2+ channel subunit immunoreactivity is highly concentrated in the active zone of GABAergic presynaptic terminals of putative parvalbumin-containing basket cells in the hippocampus. Paired recording combined with presynaptic patch pipette perfusion revealed that GABA release at basket cell-granule cell synapses is sensitive to millimolar concentrations of the fast Ca2+ chelator BAPTA but insensitive to the slow Ca2+ chelator EGTA. These results show that Ca2+ source and Ca2+ sensor are tightly coupled at this synapse, with distances in the range of 10–20 nm. Models of Ca2+ inflow-exocytosis coupling further reveal that the tightness of coupling increases efficacy, speed, and temporal precision of transmitter release. Thus, tight coupling contributes to fast feedforward and feedback inhibition in the hippocampal network.

AB  - Summary
Changing gain in a neuronal system has important functional consequences, but the underlying mechanisms have been elusive. Models have suggested a variety of neuronal and systems properties to accomplish gain control. Here, we show that the gain of the neuronal network underlying local bending behavior in leeches depends on widespread inhibition. Using behavioral analysis, intracellular recordings, and voltage-sensitive dye imaging, we compared the effects of blocking just the known lateral inhibition with blocking all GABAergic inhibition. This revealed an additional source of inhibition, which was widespread and increased in proportion to increasing stimulus intensity. In a model of the input/output functions of the three-layered local bending network, we showed that inhibiting all interneurons in proportion to the stimulus strength produces the experimentally observed change in gain. This relatively simple mechanism for controlling behavioral gain could be prevalent in vertebrate as well as invertebrate nervous systems.

AB  - Summary
Inhibitory interneurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) process visual information by precisely controlling spike timing and by refining the receptive fields of thalamocortical (TC) neurons. Previous studies indicate that dLGN interneurons inhibit TC neurons by releasing GABA from both axons and dendrites. However, the mechanisms controlling GABA release are poorly understood. Here, using simultaneous whole-cell recordings from interneurons and TC neurons and two-photon calcium imaging, we find that synchronous activation of multiple retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) triggers sodium spikes that propagate throughout interneuron axons and dendrites, and calcium spikes that invade dendrites but not axons. These distinct modes of interneuron firing can trigger both a rapid and a sustained component of inhibition onto TC neurons. Our studies suggest that active conductances make LGN interneurons flexible circuit-elements that can shift their spatial and temporal properties of GABA release in response to coincident activation of functionally related subsets of RGCs.

AB  - Summary
While much has been learned regarding the neural substrates supporting episodic encoding using highly controlled experimental protocols, relatively little is known regarding the neural bases of episodic encoding of real-world events. In an effort to examine this issue, we measured fMRI activity while observers viewed a novel TV sitcom. Three weeks later, subsequent memory (SM) for the narrative content of movie events was assessed. We analyzed the encoding data for intersubject correlations (ISC) based on subjects' subsequent memory (ISC-SM) performance to identify brain regions whose BOLD response is significantly more correlated across subjects during portions of the movie that are successfully as compared to unsuccessfully encoded. These regions include the parahippocampal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, anterior temporal poles, and the temporal-parietal junction. Further analyses reveal (1) that these correlated regions can display distinct activation profiles and (2) that the results seen with the ISC-SM analysis are complementary to more traditional linear models and allow analysis of complex time course data. Thus, the ISC-SM analysis extends traditional subsequent memory findings to a rich, dynamic and more ecologically valid situation.

AB  - Summary
Satb2 is a DNA-binding protein that regulates chromatin organization and gene expression. In the developing brain, Satb2 is expressed in cortical neurons that extend axons across the corpus callosum. To assess the role of Satb2 in neurons, we analyzed mice in which the Satb2 locus was disrupted by insertion of a LacZ gene. In mutant mice, β-galactosidase-labeled axons are absent from the corpus callosum and instead descend along the corticospinal tract. Satb2 mutant neurons acquire expression of Ctip2, a transcription factor that is necessary and sufficient for the extension of subcortical projections by cortical neurons. Conversely, ectopic expression of Satb2 in neural stem cells markedly decreases Ctip2 expression. Finally, we find that Satb2 binds directly to regulatory regions of Ctip2 and induces changes in chromatin structure. These data suggest that Satb2 functions as a repressor of Ctip2 and regulatory determinant of corticocortical connections in the developing cerebral cortex.

AB  - Although much traditional sensory research has studied each sensory modality in isolation, there has been a recent explosion of interest in causal interplay between different senses. Various techniques have now identified numerous multisensory convergence zones in the brain. Some convergence may arise surprisingly close to low-level sensory-specific cortex, and some direct connections may exist even between primary sensory cortices. A variety of multisensory phenomena have now been reported in which sensory-specific brain responses and perceptual judgments concerning one sense can be affected by relations with other senses. We survey recent progress in this multisensory field, foregrounding human studies against the background of invasive animal work and highlighting possible underlying mechanisms. These include rapid feedforward integration, possible thalamic influences, and/or feedback from multisensory regions to sensory-specific brain areas. Multisensory interplay is more prevalent than classic modular approaches assumed, and new methods are now available to determine the underlying circuits.

AB  - Summary
The identification of synaptic partners is challenging in dense nerve bundles, where many processes occupy regions beneath the resolution of conventional light microscopy. To address this difficulty, we have developed GRASP, a system to label membrane contacts and synapses between two cells in living animals. Two complementary fragments of GFP are expressed on different cells, tethered to extracellular domains of transmembrane carrier proteins. When the complementary GFP fragments are fused to ubiquitous transmembrane proteins, GFP fluorescence appears uniformly along membrane contacts between the two cells. When one or both GFP fragments are fused to synaptic transmembrane proteins, GFP fluorescence is tightly localized to synapses. GRASP marks known synaptic contacts in C. elegans, correctly identifies changes in mutants with altered synaptic specificity, and can uncover new information about synaptic locations as confirmed by electron microscopy. GRASP may prove particularly useful for defining connectivity in complex nervous systems.

AB  - Summary
The acquisition of new memories for places and events requires synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, and plasticity depends on temporal coordination among neurons. Spatial activity in the hippocampus is relatively disorganized during the initial exploration of a novel environment, however, and it is unclear how neural activity during the initial stages of learning drives synaptic plasticity. Here we show that pairs of CA1 cells that represent overlapping novel locations are initially more coactive and more precisely coordinated than are cells representing overlapping familiar locations. This increased coordination occurrs specifically during brief, high-frequency events (HFEs) in the local field potential that are similar to ripples and is not associated with better coordination of place-specific neural activity outside of HFEs. As novel locations become more familiar, correlations between cell pairs decrease. Thus, hippocampal neural activity during learning has a unique structure that is well suited to induce synaptic plasticity and to allow for rapid storage of new memories.

AB  - Summary
Short-term synaptic plasticity shapes the postsynaptic response to bursts of impulses and is crucial for encoding information in neurons, but the molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here we show that activity-dependent modulation of presynaptic CaV2.1 channels mediated by neuronal Ca2+ sensor proteins (CaS) induces synaptic plasticity in cultured superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons. A mutation of the IQ-like motif in the C terminus that blocks Ca2+/CaS-dependent facilitation of the P/Q-type Ca2+ current markedly reduces facilitation of synaptic transmission. Deletion of the nearby calmodulin-binding domain, which inhibits CaS-dependent inactivation, substantially reduces depression of synaptic transmission. These results demonstrate that residual Ca2+ in presynaptic terminals can act through CaS-dependent regulation of CaV2.1 channels to induce short-term synaptic facilitation and rapid synaptic depression. Activity-dependent regulation of presynaptic CaV2.1 channels by CaS proteins may therefore be a primary determinant of short-term synaptic plasticity and information-processing in the nervous system.

AB  - Summary
A neuroanatomical principle of striatal organization has been established through which ventral domains, including the nucleus accumbens, exert control over dorsal striatal processes mediated by so-called “spiraling,” striato-nigro-striatal, circuitry. We have investigated the functional significance of this circuitry in the control over a cocaine-seeking habit by using an intrastriatal disconnection procedure that combined a selective, unilateral lesion of the nucleus accumbens core and infusion of a dopamine receptor antagonist into the contralateral dorsolateral striatum, thereby disrupting striato-midbrain-striatal serial connectivity bilaterally. We show that this disconnection selectively decreased drug-seeking behavior in rats extensively trained under a second-order schedule of cocaine reinforcement. These data thereby define the importance of interactions between ventral and dorsal domains of the striatum, mediated by dopaminergic transmission, in the neural mechanisms underlying the development and performance of cocaine-seeking habits that are a key characteristic of drug addiction.

AB  - Summary
Addiction-associated behaviors such as drug craving and relapse are hypothesized to result from synaptic changes that persist long after withdrawal and are renormalized by drug reinstatement, although such chronic synaptic effects have not been identified. We report that exposure to the dopamine releaser methamphetamine for 10 days elicits a long-lasting (&gt;4 month) depression at corticostriatal terminals that is reversed by methamphetamine readministration. Both methamphetamine-induced chronic presynaptic depression and the drug's selective renormalization in drug-experienced animals are independent of corresponding long-term changes in synaptic dopamine release but are due to alterations in D1 dopamine and cholinergic receptor systems. These mechanisms might provide a synaptic basis that underlies addiction and habit learning and their long-term maintenance.

AB  - Summary
Attributing behavioral outcomes correctly to oneself or to other agents is essential for all productive social exchange. We approach this issue in high-functioning males with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using two separate fMRI paradigms. First, using a visual imagery task, we extract a basis set for responses along the cingulate cortex of control subjects that reveals an agent-specific eigenvector (self eigenmode) associated with imagining oneself executing a specific motor act. Second, we show that the same self eigenmode arises during one's own decision (the self phase) in an interpersonal exchange game (iterated trust game). Third, using this exchange game, we show that ASD males exhibit a severely diminished cingulate self response when playing the game with a human partner. This diminishment covaries parametrically with their behaviorally assessed symptom severity, suggesting its value as an objective endophenotype. These findings may provide a quantitative assessment tool for high-functioning ASD.

The frontal eye field (FEF) participates in selecting the location of behaviorally relevant stimuli for guiding attention and eye movements. We simultaneously recorded local field potentials (LFPs) and spiking activity in the FEF of monkeys performing memory-guided saccade and covert visual search tasks. We compared visual latencies and the time course of spatially selective responses in LFPs and spiking activity. Consistent with the view that LFPs represent synaptic input, visual responses appeared first in the LFPs followed by visual responses in the spiking activity. However, spatially selective activity identifying the location of the target in the visual search array appeared in the spikes about 30 ms before it appeared in the LFPs. Because LFPs reflect dendritic input and spikes measure neuronal output in a local brain region, this temporal relationship suggests that spatial selection necessary for attention and eye movements is computed locally in FEF from spatially nonselective inputs.

AB  - Summary
The mossy fiber to CA3 pyramidal cell synapse (mf-CA3) provides a major source of excitation to the hippocampus. Thus far, these glutamatergic synapses are well recognized for showing a presynaptic, NMDA receptor-independent form of LTP that is expressed as a long-lasting increase of transmitter release. Here, we show that in addition to this “classical” LTP, mf-CA3 synapses can undergo a form of LTP characterized by a selective enhancement of NMDA receptor-mediated transmission. This potentiation requires coactivation of NMDA and mGlu5 receptors and a postsynaptic calcium rise. Unlike classical LTP, expression of this mossy fiber LTP is due to a PKC-dependent recruitment of NMDA receptors specifically to the mf-CA3 synapse via a SNARE-dependent process. Having two mechanistically different forms of LTP may allow mf-CA3 synapses to respond with more flexibility to the changing demands of the hippocampal network.

AB  - Summary
Huntington's disease (HD) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a translated CAG repeat in the N terminus of the huntingtin (htt) protein. Here we describe the generation and characterization of a full-length HD Drosophila model to reveal a previously unknown disease mechanism that occurs early in the course of pathogenesis, before expanded htt is imported into the nucleus in detectable amounts. We find that expanded full-length htt (128QhttFL) leads to behavioral, neurodegenerative, and electrophysiological phenotypes. These phenotypes are caused by a Ca2+-dependent increase in neurotransmitter release efficiency in 128QhttFL animals. Partial loss of function in synaptic transmission (syntaxin, Snap, Rop) and voltage-gated Ca2+ channel genes suppresses both the electrophysiological and the neurodegenerative phenotypes. Thus, our data indicate that increased neurotransmission is at the root of neuronal degeneration caused by expanded full-length htt during early stages of pathogenesis.

AB  - Summary
The expression of unconventional vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT3 by neurons known to release a different classical transmitter has suggested novel roles for signaling by glutamate, but this distribution has raised questions about whether the protein actually contributes to glutamate release. We now report that mice lacking VGLUT3 are profoundly deaf due to the absence of glutamate release from hair cells at the first synapse in the auditory pathway. The early degeneration of some cochlear ganglion neurons in knockout mice also indicates an important developmental role for the glutamate released by hair cells before the onset of hearing. In addition, the mice exhibit primary, generalized epilepsy that is accompanied by remarkably little change in ongoing motor behavior. The glutamate release conferred by expression of VGLUT3 thus has an essential role in both function and development of the auditory pathway, as well as in the control of cortical excitability.

The fidelity with which spinal motor neurons innervate their limb target muscles helps to coordinate motor behavior, but the mechanisms that determine precise patterns of nerve-muscle connectivity remain obscure. We show that Nkx6 proteins, a set of Hox-regulated homeodomain transcription factors, are expressed by motor pools soon after motor neurons leave the cell cycle, before the formation of muscle nerve side branches in the limb. Using mouse genetics, we show that the status of Nkx6.1 expression in certain motor neuron pools regulates muscle nerve formation, and the pattern of innervation of individual muscles. Our findings provide genetic evidence that neurons within motor pools possess an early transcriptional identity that controls target muscle specificity.

In this issue of Neuron, Saneyoshi et al. identify a new signaling complex containing CaMKK/CaMKI/βPIX/Rac that regulates the morphogenesis of spines in an activity-dependent manner.

AB  - Summary
Synapse function and plasticity depend on the physical structure of dendritic spines as determined by the actin cytoskeleton. We have investigated the organization of filamentous (F-) actin within individual spines on CA1 pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampal slices. Using two-photon photoactivation of green fluorescent protein fused to β-actin, we found that a dynamic pool of F-actin at the tip of the spine quickly treadmilled to generate an expansive force. The size of a stable F-actin pool at the base of the spine depended on spine volume. Repeated two-photon uncaging of glutamate formed a third pool of F-actin and enlarged the spine. The spine often released this “enlargement pool” into the dendritic shaft, but the pool had to be physically confined by a spine neck for the enlargement to be long-lasting. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II regulated this confinement. Thus, spines have an elaborate mechanical nature that is regulated by actin fibers.

AB  - Voltage-gated ion channels derive their voltage sensitivity from the movement of specific charged residues in response to a change in transmembrane potential. Several studies on mechanisms of voltage sensing in ion channels support the idea that these gating charges move through a well-defined permeation pathway. This gating pathway in a voltage-gated ion channel can also be mutated to transport free cations, including protons. The recent discovery of proton channels with sequence homology to the voltage-sensing domains suggests that evolution has perhaps exploited the same gating pathway to generate a bona fide voltage-dependent proton transporter. Here we will discuss implications of these findings on the mechanisms underlying charge (and ion) transport by voltage-sensing domains.

AB  - The formation of the nervous system during embryonic development is controlled by a complex network of signaling pathways which ensure proper migration and targeting of neuronal projections. Likewise, the function of the adult nervous system relies on complex dynamic interactions between the presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals. Here, we review recent advances in understanding the molecular pathways underlying these seemingly distinct processes. These studies reveal that the conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase PHR (PAM, highwire Rpm-1) controls a regulatory protein degradation pathway essential both for axonal targeting during embryonic development as well as for the proper formation and function of neuron muscular junctions (NMJ).

AB  - Summary
Neuronal activity augments maturation of mushroom-shaped spines to form excitatory synapses, thereby strengthening synaptic transmission. We have delineated a Ca2+-signaling pathway downstream of the NMDA receptor that stimulates calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase (CaMKK) and CaMKI to promote formation of spines and synapses in hippocampal neurons. CaMKK and CaMKI form a multiprotein signaling complex with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) βPIX and GIT1 that is localized in spines. CaMKI-mediated phosphorylation of Ser516 in βPIX enhances its GEF activity, resulting in activation of Rac1, an established enhancer of spinogenesis. Suppression of CaMKK or CaMKI by pharmacological inhibitors, dominant-negative (dn) constructs and siRNAs, as well as expression of the βPIX Ser516Ala mutant, decreases spine formation and mEPSC frequency. Constitutively-active Pak1, a downstream effector of Rac1, rescues spine inhibition by dnCaMKI or βPIX S516A. This activity-dependent signaling pathway can promote synapse formation during neuronal development and in structural plasticity.

AB  - Summary
Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) isozymes play roles in a diversity of processes including Drosophila phototransduction. In fly photoreceptor cells, the PLCβ encoded by norpA is critical for activation of TRP channels. Here, we describe a PLCβ regulator, STOPS, which encodes a SOCS box protein. Mutation of stops resulted in a reduced concentration of NORPA and a defect in stopping signaling following cessation of the light stimulus. NORPA has been proposed to have dual roles as a PLC- and GTPase-activating protein (GAP). We found that the slow termination resulting from expressing low levels of wild-type NORPA was suppressed by addition of normal amounts of an altered NORPA, which had wild-type GAP activity, but no PLC activity. STOPS is the first protein identified that specifically regulates PLCβ protein concentration. Moreover, this work demonstrates that a PLCβ derivative that does not promote TRP channel activation, still contributes to signaling in vivo.

AB  - While we know that the neocortex occupies 85% of our brains and that its circuits allow an enormous flexibility and repertoire of behavior (not to mention unexplained phenomena like consciousness), a century after Cajal we have very little knowledge of the details of the cortical circuits or their mode of function. One simplifying hypothesis that has existed since Cajal is that the neocortex consists of repeated copies of the same fundamental circuit. However, finding that fundamental circuit has proved elusive, although partial drafts of a “canonical circuit” appear in many different guises of structure and function. Here, we review some critical stages in the history of this quest. In doing so, we consider the style of cortical computation in relation to the neuronal machinery that supports it. We conclude that the structure and function of cortex honors two major computational principles: “just-enough” and “just-in-time.”

The clinical efficacy of a systemically administered drug acting on the central nervous system depends on its ability to pass the blood-brain barrier, which is regulated by transporter molecules such as ABCB1 (MDR1). Here we report that polymorphisms in the ABCB1 gene predict the response to antidepressant treatment in those depressed patients receiving drugs that have been identified as substrates of ABCB1 using abcb1ab double-knockout mice. Our results indicate that the combined consideration of both the medication's capacity to act as an ABCB1-transporter substrate and the patient's ABCB1 genotype are strong predictors for achieving a remission. This finding can be viewed as a further step into personalized antidepressant treatment.

AB  - Summary
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly expressed in vertebrate neural tissues, but the contribution of specific miRNAs to the development and function of different neuronal populations is still largely unknown. We report that miRNAs are required for terminal differentiation of olfactory precursors in both mouse and zebrafish but are dispensable for proper function of mature olfactory neurons. The repertoire of miRNAs expressed in olfactory tissues contains over 100 distinct miRNAs. A subset, including the miR-200 family, shows high olfactory enrichment and expression patterns consistent with a role during olfactory neurogenesis. Loss of function of the miR-200 family phenocopies the terminal differentiation defect observed in absence of all miRNA activity in olfactory progenitors. Our data support the notion that vertebrate tissue differentiation is controlled by conserved subsets of organ-specific miRNAs in both mouse and zebrafish and provide insights into control mechanisms underlying olfactory differentiation in vertebrates.

AB  - Summary
In addition to the classical, center/surround receptive field of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), there is an extraclassical, nonlinear surround that can strongly suppress LGN responses. This form of suppression likely plays an important role in adjusting the gain of LGN responses to visual stimuli. We performed experiments in alert and anesthetized macaque monkeys to quantify extraclassical suppression in the LGN and determine the roles of feedforward and feedback pathways in the generation of LGN suppression. Results show that suppression is significantly stronger among magnocellular neurons than parvocellular neurons and that suppression arises too quickly for involvement from cortical feedback. Furthermore, the amount of suppression supplied by the retina is not significantly different from that in the LGN. These results indicate that extraclassical suppression in the macaque LGN relies on feedforward mechanisms and suggest that suppression in the cortex likely includes a component established in the retina.

AB  - Summary
Neutral ceramidase, a key enzyme of sphingolipid metabolism, hydrolyzes ceramide to sphingosine. These sphingolipids are critical structural components of cell membranes and act as second messengers in diverse signal transduction cascades. Here, we have isolated and characterized functional null mutants of Drosophila ceramidase. We show that secreted ceramidase functions in a cell-nonautonomous manner to maintain photoreceptor homeostasis. In the absence of ceramidase, photoreceptors degenerate in a light-dependent manner, are defective in normal endocytic turnover of rhodopsin, and do not respond to light stimulus. Consistent with a cell-nonautonomous function, overexpression of ceramidase in tissues distant from photoreceptors suppresses photoreceptor degeneration in an arrestin mutant and facilitates membrane turnover in a rhodopsin null mutant. Furthermore, our results show that secreted ceramidase is internalized and localizes to endosomes. Our findings establish a role for a secreted sphingolipid enzyme in the regulation of photoreceptor structure and function.

AB  - Summary
The postsynaptic density protein PSD-95 influences synaptic AMPA receptor (AMPAR) content and may play a critical role in LTD. Here we demonstrate that the effects of PSD-95 on AMPAR-mediated synaptic responses and LTD can be dissociated. Our findings suggest that N-terminal-domain-mediated dimerization is important for PSD-95's effect on basal synaptic AMPAR function, whereas the C-terminal SH3-GK domains are also necessary for localizing PSD-95 to synapses. We identify PSD-95 point mutants (Q15A, E17R) that maintain PSD-95's influence on basal AMPAR synaptic responses yet block LTD. These point mutants increase the proteolysis of PSD-95 within its N-terminal domain, resulting in a C-terminal fragment that functions as a dominant negative likely by scavenging critical signaling proteins required for LTD. Thus, the C-terminal portion of PSD-95 serves a dual function. It is required to localize PSD-95 at synapses and as a scaffold for signaling proteins that are required for LTD.

Here, we review new work showing that associative synaptic plasticity can be generated without neuronal output and that the interplay between neuronal architecture and the active electrical properties of the dendritic tree regulates synaptic plasticity.

Perceptual learning is regarded as a manifestation of experience-dependent plasticity in the sensory systems, yet the underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. We measured the dynamics of performance on a visual task and brain activation in the human primary visual cortex (V1) across the time course of perceptual learning. Within the first few weeks of training, brain activation in a V1 subregion corresponding to the trained visual field quadrant and task performance both increased. However, while performance levels then saturated and were maintained at a constant level, brain activation in the corresponding areas decreased to the level observed before training. These findings indicate that there are distinct temporal phases in the time course of perceptual learning, related to differential dynamics of BOLD activity in visual cortex.

Direction selectivity in the retina requires the asymmetric wiring of inhibitory inputs onto four subtypes of On-Off direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs), each preferring motion in one of four cardinal directions. The primary model for the development of direction selectivity is that patterned activity plays an instructive role. Here, we use a unique, large-scale multielectrode array to demonstrate that DSGCs are present at eye opening, in mice that have been reared in darkness and in mice that lack cholinergic retinal waves. These data suggest that direction selectivity in the retina is established largely independent of patterned activity and is therefore likely to emerge as a result of complex molecular interactions.

AB  - Summary
The organization of neuronal processes into a series of layers is a hallmark of many brain regions. Homophilic cell adhesion molecules of the cadherin family have been implicated in layer choice. How they contribute to the targeting of neurons to distinct layers remains unclear. Here we systematically explore the role of a classical cadherin, Drosophila N-cadherin (CadN), in the targeting of five classes of related neurons to a series of consecutive layers in the fly visual system. We show that CadN is required in lamina neurons at discrete developmental steps but not used in a layer-specific fashion. Local CadN expression patterns correlate with specific growth cone movements, and CadN expression on one growth cone in a specific layer is essential for the targeting of processes of another neuron to this layer. We propose that dynamic regulation of CadN enables this widely expressed protein to mediate specific local interactions during neural circuit assembly.

AB  - Summary
The level of electrotonic coupling in the inferior olive is extremely high, but its functional role in cerebellar motor control remains elusive. Here, we subjected mice that lack olivary coupling to paradigms that require learning-dependent timing. Cx36-deficient mice showed impaired timing of both locomotion and eye-blink responses that were conditioned to a tone. The latencies of their olivary spike activities in response to the unconditioned stimulus were significantly more variable than those in wild-types. Whole-cell recordings of olivary neurons in vivo showed that these differences in spike timing result at least in part from altered interactions with their subthreshold oscillations. These results, combined with analyses of olivary activities in computer simulations at both the cellular and systems level, suggest that electrotonic coupling among olivary neurons by gap junctions is essential for proper timing of their action potentials and thereby for learning-dependent timing in cerebellar motor control.

AB  - Summary
Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs) transduce external signals required for sensory processes, e.g., photoreception, olfaction, and taste. Nerve growth cone guidance by diffusible attractive and repulsive molecules is regulated by differential growth cone Ca2+ signaling. However, the Ca2+-conducting ion channels that transduce guidance molecule signals are largely unknown. We show that rod-type CNGC-like channels function in the repulsion of cultured Xenopus spinal neuron growth cones by Sema3A, which triggers the production of the cGMP that activates the Xenopus CNGA1 (xCNGA1) subunit-containing channels in interneurons. Downregulation of xCNGA1 or overexpression of a mutant xCNGA1 incapable of binding cGMP abolished CNG currents and converted growth cone repulsion to attraction in response to Sema3A. We also show that Ca2+ entry through xCNGCs is required to mediate the repulsive Sema3A signal. These studies extend our knowledge of the function of CNGCs by demonstrating their requirement for signal transduction in growth cone guidance.

However, Coulthard and colleagues in this issue of Neuron show that damage to the right parietal lobe reverses this effect, paradoxically facilitating responses. This surprising result may shed light on the functional role of parietal cortex within a larger cortical circuit for voluntary behavior.

AB  - Summary
In voltage-gated channels, ions flow through a single pore located at the interface between membrane-spanning pore domains from each of four subunits, and the gates of the pore are controlled by four peripheral voltage-sensing domains. In a striking exception, the newly discovered voltage-gated Hv1 proton channels lack a homologous pore domain, leaving the location of the pore unknown. Also unknown are the number of subunits and the mechanism of gating. We find that Hv1 is a dimer and that each subunit contains its own pore and gate, which is controlled by its own voltage sensor. Our experiments show that the cytosolic domain of the channel is necessary and sufficient for dimerization and that the transmembrane part of the channel is functional also when monomerized. The results suggest a mechanism of gating whereby the voltage sensor and gate are one and the same.

AB  - Summary
Gain modulation is a widespread neuronal phenomenon that modifies response amplitude without changing selectivity. Computational and in vitro studies have proposed cellular mechanisms of gain modulation based on the postsynaptic effects of background synaptic activation, but these mechanisms have not been studied in vivo. Here, we used intracellular recordings from cat primary visual cortex to measure neuronal gain while changing background synaptic activity with visual stimulation. We found that increases in the membrane fluctuations associated with increases in synaptic input do not obligatorily result in gain modulation in vivo. However, visual stimuli that evoked sustained changes in resting membrane potential, input resistance, and membrane fluctuations robustly modulated neuronal gain. The magnitude of gain modulation depended critically on the spatiotemporal properties of the visual stimulus. Gain modulation in vivo may thus be determined on a moment-to-moment basis by sensory context and the consequent dynamics of synaptic activation.

A fundamental question about the neural correlates of attention concerns the earliest sensory processing stage that it can affect. We addressed this issue by recording magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals while subjects performed detection tasks, which required employment of spatial or nonspatial attention, in auditory or visual modality. Using distributed source analysis of MEG signals, we found that, contrary to previous studies that used equivalent current dipole (ECD) analysis, spatial attention enhanced the initial feedforward response in the primary visual cortex (V1) at 55–90 ms. We also found attentional modulation of the putative primary auditory cortex (A1) activity at 30–50 ms. Furthermore, we reproduced our findings using ECD modeling guided by the results of distributed source analysis and suggest a reason why earlier studies using ECD analysis failed to identify the modulation of earliest V1 activity.

AB  - Summary
Insulin receptor signaling has been postulated to play a role in synaptic plasticity; however, the function of the insulin receptor in CNS is not clear. To test whether insulin receptor signaling affects visual system function, we recorded light-evoked responses in optic tectal neurons in living Xenopus tadpoles. Tectal neurons transfected with dominant-negative insulin receptor (dnIR), which reduces insulin receptor phosphorylation, or morpholino against insulin receptor, which reduces total insulin receptor protein level, have significantly smaller light-evoked responses than controls. dnIR-expressing neurons have reduced synapse density as assessed by EM, decreased AMPA mEPSC frequency, and altered experience-dependent dendritic arbor structural plasticity, although synaptic vesicle release probability, assessed by paired-pulse responses, synapse maturation, assessed by AMPA/NMDA ratio and ultrastructural criteria, are unaffected by dnIR expression. These data indicate that insulin receptor signaling regulates circuit function and plasticity by controlling synapse density.

Voltage-driven activation of Kv channels results from conformational changes of four voltage sensor domains (VSDs) that surround the K+ selective pore domain. How the VSD helices rearrange during gating is an area of active research. Luminescence resonance energy transfer (LRET) is a powerful spectroscopic ruler uniquely suitable for addressing the conformational trajectory of these helices. Using a geometric analysis of numerous LRET measurements, we were able to estimate LRET probe positions relative to existing structural models. The experimental movement of helix S4 does not support a large 15–20 Å transmembrane “paddle-type” movement or a near-zero Å vertical “transporter-type” model. Rather, our measurements demonstrate a moderate S4 displacement of 10 ± 5 Å, with a vertical component of 5 ± 2 Å. The S3 segment moves 2 ± 1 Å in the opposite direction and is therefore not moving as an S3–S4 rigid body.

AB  - Summary
Homeostatic plasticity keeps neuronal spiking output within an optimal range in the face of chronically altered levels of network activity. Little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms, particularly in response to elevated activity. We report that, in hippocampal neurons experiencing heightened activity, the activity-inducible protein kinase Polo-like kinase 2 (Plk2, also known as SNK) was required for synaptic scaling—a principal mechanism underlying homeostatic plasticity. Synaptic scaling also required CDK5, which acted as a “priming” kinase for the phospho-dependent binding of Plk2 to its substrate SPAR, a postsynaptic RapGAP and scaffolding molecule that is degraded following phosphorylation by Plk2. RNAi knockdown of SPAR weakened synapses, and overexpression of a SPAR mutant resistant to Plk2-dependent degradation prevented synaptic scaling. Thus, priming phosphorylation of the Plk2 binding site in SPAR by CDK5, followed by Plk2 recruitment and SPAR phosphorylation-degradation, constitutes a molecular pathway for neuronal homeostatic plasticity during chronically elevated activity.

AB  - Summary
K2P channels mediate potassium background currents essential to central nervous system function, controlling excitability by stabilizing membrane potential below firing threshold and expediting repolarization. Here, we show that alternative translation initiation (ATI) regulates function of K2P2.1 (TREK-1) via an unexpected strategy. Full-length K2P2.1 and an isoform lacking the first 56 residues of the intracellular N terminus (K2P2.1Δ1-56) are produced differentially in a regional and developmental manner in the rat central nervous system, the latter passing sodium under physiological conditions leading to membrane depolarization. Control of ion selectivity via ATI is proposed to be a natural, epigenetic mechanism for spatial and temporal regulation of neuronal excitability.

AB  - Survival can depend on the ability to change a current course of action to respond to potentially advantageous or threatening stimuli. This “reorienting” response involves the coordinated action of a right hemisphere dominant ventral frontoparietal network that interrupts and resets ongoing activity and a dorsal frontoparietal network specialized for selecting and linking stimuli and responses. At rest, each network is distinct and internally correlated, but when attention is focused, the ventral network is suppressed to prevent reorienting to distracting events. These different patterns of recruitment may reflect inputs to the ventral attention network from the locus coeruleus/norepinephrine system. While originally conceptualized as a system for redirecting attention from one object to another, recent evidence suggests a more general role in switching between networks, which may explain recent evidence of its involvement in functions such as social cognition.

AB  - Summary
Reward from a particular action is seldom immediate, and the influence of such delayed outcome on choice decreases with delay. It has been postulated that when faced with immediate and delayed rewards, decision makers choose the option with maximum temporally discounted value. We examined the preference of monkeys for delayed reward in an intertemporal choice task and the neural basis for real-time computation of temporally discounted values in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. During this task, the locations of the targets associated with small or large rewards and their corresponding delays were randomly varied. We found that prefrontal neurons often encoded the temporally discounted value of reward expected from a particular option. Furthermore, activity tended to increase when discounted values for targets were presented in the neuron's preferred direction, suggesting that activity related to temporally discounted values in the prefrontal cortex might determine the animal's behavior during intertemporal choice.

AB  - Summary
Salient stimuli that modify behavior induce transcription of activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc/Arg3.1) and transport Arc mRNA into dendrites, suggesting that local Arc translation mediates synaptic plasticity that encodes such stimuli. Here, we demonstrate that long-term synaptic depression (LTD) in hippocampal neurons induced by group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) relies on rapid translation of Arc. mGluR-LTD induction causes long-term increases in AMPA receptor endocytosis rate and dendritic synthesis of Arc, a component of the AMPAR endocytosis machinery. Knockdown of Arc prevents mGluRs from triggering AMPAR endocytosis or LTD, and acute blockade of new Arc synthesis with antisense oligonucleotides blocks mGluR-LTD and AMPAR trafficking. In contrast, LTD induced by NMDA receptors does not persistently alter AMPAR endocytosis rate, induce Arc synthesis, or require Arc protein. These data demonstrate a role for local Arc synthesis specifically in mGluR-LTD and suggest that mGluR-LTD may be one consequence of Arc mRNA induction during experience.

AB  - Summary
Trafficking of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) is regulated by specific interactions of the subunit intracellular C-terminal domains (CTDs) with other proteins, but the mechanisms involved in this process are still unclear. We have found that the GluR1 CTD binds to cGMP-dependent protein kinase II (cGKII) adjacent to the kinase catalytic site. Binding of GluR1 is increased when cGKII is activated by cGMP. cGKII and GluR1 form a complex in the brain, and cGKII in this complex phosphorylates GluR1 at S845, a site also phosphorylated by PKA. Activation of cGKII by cGMP increases the surface expression of AMPARs at extrasynaptic sites. Inhibition of cGKII activity blocks the surface increase of GluR1 during chemLTP and reduces LTP in the hippocampal slice. This work identifies a pathway, downstream from the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) and nitric oxide (NO), which stimulates GluR1 accumulation in the plasma membrane and plays an important role in synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Here we describe mechanisms regulating area patterning of developing mammalian neocortex, referred to as arealization. Current findings indicate an interplay between intrinsic genetic mechanisms and extrinsic information relayed to cortex by thalamocortical input. Intrinsic mechanisms are based on morphogens and signaling molecules secreted by patterning centers, positioned at the perimeter of dorsal telencephalon, that generate across nascent cortex the graded expression of transcription factors in cortical progenitors. Two major patterning centers are the commissural plate, which expresses Fgf8 and Fgf17, and the cortical hem, which expresses Bmps and Wnts. Four transcription factors, COUP-TFI, Emx2, Pax6, and Sp8, with graded expression across the embryonic cortical axes, are shown to determine sizes and positions of cortical areas by specifying or repressing area identities within cortical progenitors. They also interact to modify their expression, as well as expression of Fgf8. We review these mechanisms of arealization and discuss models and concepts of cortical area patterning.

AB  - Functional maps arise in developing visual cortex as response selectivities become organized into columnar patterns of population activity. Recent studies of developing orientation and direction maps indicate that both are sensitive to visual experience, but not to the same degree or duration. Direction maps have a greater dependence on early vision, while orientation maps remain sensitive to experience for a longer period of cortical maturation. There is also a darker side to experience: abnormal vision through closed lids produces severe impairments in neuronal selectivity, rendering these maps nearly undetectable. Thus, the rules that govern their formation and the construction of the underlying neural circuits are modulated—for better or worse—by early vision. Direction maps, and possibly maps of other properties that are dependent upon precise conjunctions of spatial and temporal signals, are most susceptible to the potential benefits and maladaptive consequences of early sensory experience.

AB  - Summary
Much of the visual cortex is organized into visual field maps: nearby neurons have receptive fields at nearby locations in the image. Mammalian species generally have multiple visual field maps with each species having similar, but not identical, maps. The introduction of functional magnetic resonance imaging made it possible to identify visual field maps in human cortex, including several near (1) medial occipital (V1,V2,V3), (2) lateral occipital (LO-1,LO-2, hMT+), (3) ventral occipital (hV4, VO-1, VO-2), (4) dorsal occipital (V3A, V3B), and (5) posterior parietal cortex (IPS-0 to IPS-4). Evidence is accumulating for additional maps, including some in the frontal lobe. Cortical maps are arranged into clusters in which several maps have parallel eccentricity representations, while the angular representations within a cluster alternate in visual field sign. Visual field maps have been linked to functional and perceptual properties of the visual system at various spatial scales, ranging from the level of individual maps to map clusters to dorsal-ventral streams. We survey recent measurements of human visual field maps, describe hypotheses about the function and relationships between maps, and consider methods to improve map measurements and characterize the response properties of neurons comprising these maps.

AB  - Summary
The establishment of functional neural circuits requires the guidance of axons in response to the actions of secreted and cell-surface molecules such as the semaphorins. Semaphorin 3E and its receptor PlexinD1 are expressed in the brain, but their functions are unknown. Here, we show that Sema3E/PlexinD1 signaling plays an important role in initial development of descending axon tracts in the forebrain. Early errors in axonal projections are reflected in behavioral deficits in Sema3E null mutant mice. Two distinct signaling mechanisms can be distinguished downstream of Sema3E. On corticofugal and striatonigral neurons expressing PlexinD1 but not Neuropilin-1, Sema3E acts as a repellent. In contrast, on subiculo-mammillary neurons coexpressing PlexinD1 and Neuropilin-1, Sema3E acts as an attractant. The extracellular domain of Neuropilin-1 is sufficient to convert repulsive signaling by PlexinD1 to attraction. Our data therefore reveal a “gating” function of neuropilins in semaphorin-plexin signaling during the assembly of forebrain neuronal circuits.

AB  - Summary
Synaptic potentials originating at distal dendritic locations are severely attenuated when they reach the soma and, thus, are poor at driving somatic spikes. Nonetheless, distal inputs convey essential information, suggesting that such inputs may be important for compartmentalized dendritic signaling. Here we report a new plasticity rule in which stimulation of distal perforant path inputs to hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons induces long-term potentiation at the CA1 proximal Schaffer collateral synapses when the two inputs are paired at a precise interval. This subthreshold form of heterosynaptic plasticity occurs in the absence of somatic spiking but requires activation of both NMDA receptors and IP3 receptor-dependent release of Ca2+ from internal stores. Our results suggest that direct sensory information arriving at distal CA1 synapses through the perforant path provide compartmentalized, instructive signals that assess the saliency of mnemonic information propagated through the hippocampal circuit to proximal synapses.

AB  - Summary
Across multiple timescales, acoustic regularities of speech match rhythmic properties of both the auditory and motor systems. Syllabic rate corresponds to natural jaw-associated oscillatory rhythms, and phonemic length could reflect endogenous oscillatory auditory cortical properties. Hemispheric lateralization for speech could result from an asymmetry of cortical tuning, with left and right auditory areas differentially sensitive to spectro-temporal features of speech. Using simultaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recordings from humans, we show that spontaneous EEG power variations within the gamma range (phonemic rate) correlate best with left auditory cortical synaptic activity, while fluctuations within the theta range correlate best with that in the right. Power fluctuations in both ranges correlate with activity in the mouth premotor region, indicating coupling between temporal properties of speech perception and production. These data show that endogenous cortical rhythms provide temporal and spatial constraints on the neuronal mechanisms underlying speech perception and production.

AB  - Summary
GABA transporters play an important but poorly understood role in neuronal inhibition. They can reverse, but this is widely thought to occur only under pathological conditions. Here we use a heterologous expression system to show that the reversal potential of GAT-1 under physiologically relevant conditions is near the normal resting potential of neurons and that reversal can occur rapidly enough to release GABA during simulated action potentials. We then use paired recordings from cultured hippocampal neurons and show that GABAergic transmission is not prevented by four methods widely used to block vesicular release. This nonvesicular neurotransmission was potently blocked by GAT-1 antagonists and was enhanced by agents that increase cytosolic [GABA] or [Na+] (which would increase GAT-1 reversal). We conclude that GAT-1 regulates tonic inhibition by clamping ambient [GABA] at a level high enough to activate high-affinity GABAA receptors and that transporter-mediated GABA release can contribute to phasic inhibition.

AB  - Summary
Upon arriving at their targets, developing axons cease pathfinding and begin instead to arborize and form synapses. To test whether CNS arborization and synaptogenesis are controlled by Slit-Robo signaling, we followed single retinal ganglion cell (RGC) arbors over time. ast (robo2) mutant and slit1a morphant arbors had more branch tips and greater arbor area and complexity compared to wild-type and concomitantly more presumptive presynaptic sites labeled with YFP-Rab3. Increased arborization in ast was phenocopied by dominant-negative Robo2 expressed in single RGCs and rescued by full-length Robo2, indicating that Robo2 acts cell-autonomously. Time-lapse imaging revealed that ast and slit1a morphant arbors stabilized earlier than wild-type, suggesting a role for Slit-Robo signaling in preventing arbor maturation. Genetic analysis showed that Slit1a acts both through Robo2 and Robo2-independent mechanisms. Unlike previous PNS studies showing that Slits promote branching, our results show that Slits inhibit arborization and synaptogenesis in the CNS.

AB  - Summary
MeCP2 is a transcriptional repressor critical for normal neurological function. Prior studies demonstrated that either loss or doubling of MeCP2 results in postnatal neurodevelopmental disorders. To understand the impact of MeCP2 expression on neuronal function, we studied the synaptic properties of individual neurons from mice that either lack or express twice the normal levels of MeCP2. Hippocampal glutamatergic neurons that lack MeCP2 display a 46% reduction in synaptic response, whereas neurons with doubling of MeCP2 exhibit a 2-fold enhancement in synaptic response. Further analysis shows that these changes were primarily due to the number of synapses formed. These results reveal that MeCP2 is a key rate-limiting factor in regulating glutamatergic synapse formation in early postnatal development and that changes in excitatory synaptic strength may underlie global network alterations in neurological disorders due to altered MeCP2 levels.

AB  - Summary
The neural basis of spatial processing in the auditory cortex has been controversial. Human fMRI studies suggest that a part of the planum temporale (PT) is involved in auditory spatial processing, but it was recently argued that this region is active only when the task requires voluntary spatial localization. If this is the case, then this region cannot harbor an ongoing spatial representation of the acoustic environment. In contrast, we show in three fMRI experiments that a region in the human medial PT is sensitive to background auditory spatial changes, even when subjects are not engaged in a spatial localization task, and in fact attend the visual modality. During such times, this area responded to rare location shifts, and even more so when spatial variation increased, consistent with spatially selective adaptation. Thus, acoustic space is represented in the human PT even when sound processing is not required by the ongoing task.

AB  - Summary
Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) cause early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the only genetic risk factor for late-onset AD is the ɛ4 allele of apolipoprotein E (apoE), a major cholesterol carrier. Using Cre-lox conditional knockout mice, we demonstrate that lipoprotein receptor LRP1 expression regulates apoE and cholesterol levels within the CNS. We also found that deletion of APP and its homolog APLP2, or components of the γ-secretase complex, significantly enhanced the expression and function of LRP1, which was reversed by forced expression of the APP intracellular domain (AICD). We further show that AICD, together with Fe65 and Tip60, interacts with the LRP1 promoter and suppresses its transcription. Together, our findings support that the γ-secretase cleavage of APP plays a central role in regulating apoE and cholesterol metabolism in the CNS via LRP1 and establish a biological linkage between APP and apoE, the two major genetic determinants of AD.

The present study examined how hippocampal neuronal populations encode spatial and temporal context as rats performed a task in which they were required to remember the order of trial-unique sequences of odors. The results suggest that a gradual change in the pattern of hippocampal activity served as a temporal context for odor-sampling events and was important for successful subsequent memory of the order of those odors.

In addition to reviewing these findings, we suggest in this Preview how these findings in the mouse could have relevance for human behavior.

AB  - Summary
Tactile information is actively acquired and processed in the brain through concerted interactions between movement and sensation. Somatosensory input is often the result of self-generated movement during the active touch of objects, and conversely, sensory information is used to refine motor control. There must therefore be important interactions between sensory and motor pathways, which we chose to investigate in the mouse whisker sensorimotor system. Voltage-sensitive dye was applied to the neocortex of mice to directly image the membrane potential dynamics of sensorimotor cortex with subcolumnar spatial resolution and millisecond temporal precision. Single brief whisker deflections evoked highly distributed depolarizing cortical sensory responses, which began in the primary somatosensory barrel cortex and subsequently excited the whisker motor cortex. The spread of sensory information to motor cortex was dynamically regulated by behavior and correlated with the generation of sensory-evoked whisker movement. Sensory processing in motor cortex may therefore contribute significantly to active tactile sensory perception.

AB  - Summary
Transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) are auxiliary AMPA receptor subunits that regulate both the trafficking and gating properties of AMPA receptors, and different TARP isoforms display distinct expression patterns in brain. Here, we compared the effects of four TARP isoforms on the kinetics of AMPA receptor currents. Each isoform slowed the deactivation of GluR1 currents, but the slowing was greatest with γ-4 and γ-8. Isoform-specific differences in desensitization were also observed that correlated with effects on deactivation. TARP isoforms also differentially modulated responses to trains of glutamate applications designed to mimic high-frequency presynaptic firing. Importantly, whereas both stargazin and γ-4 rescued excitatory synaptic transmission in cerebellar granule cells from stargazer mice, the decay of miniature EPSCs was 2-fold slower in neurons expressing γ-4. The results show that heterogeneity in the composition of AMPA receptor/TARP complexes contributes to synapse-specific differences in EPSC decays and frequency-dependent modulation of neurotransmission.

AB  - Changes in the response to release of a single synaptic vesicle have generally been attributed to postsynaptic modification of receptor sensitivity, but considerable evidence now demonstrates that alterations in vesicle filling also contribute to changes in quantal size. Receptors are not saturated at many synapses, and changes in the amount of transmitter per vesicle contribute to the physiological regulation of release. On the other hand, the presynaptic factors that determine quantal size remain poorly understood. Aside from regulation of the fusion pore, these mechanisms fall into two general categories: those that affect the accumulation of transmitter inside a vesicle and those that affect vesicle size. This review will summarize current understanding of the neurotransmitter cycle and indicate basic, unanswered questions about the presynaptic regulation of quantal size.

AB  - Summary
Cholinergic neurons originating from the basal forebrain innervate the entire cortical mantle. Choline-sensitive microelectrodes were used to measure the synaptic release of cortical acetylcholine (ACh) at a subsecond resolution in rats performing a task involving the detection of cues. Cues that were detected, defined behaviorally, evoked transient increases in cholinergic activity (at the scale of seconds) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), but not in a nonassociational control region (motor cortex). In trials involving missed cues, cholinergic transients were not observed. Cholinergic deafferentation of the mPFC, but not motor cortex, impaired cue detection. Furthermore, decreases and increases in precue cholinergic activity predicted subsequent cue detection or misses, respectively. Finally, cue-evoked cholinergic transients were superimposed over slower (at the timescale of minutes) changes in cholinergic activity. Cortical cholinergic neurotransmission is regulated on multiple timescales to mediate the detection of behaviorally significant cues and to support cognitive performance.

Pathology extends this conclusion further, as the former is implicated in epilepsy and the latter in anxiety. The well-balanced cooperation of the two inhibitory systems is required for the normal network operations underlying the cognitive functions of the cerebral cortex.

AB  - Part of human cortex is specialized for cultural domains such as reading and arithmetic, whose invention is too recent to have influenced the evolution of our species. Representations of letter strings and of numbers occupy reproducible locations within large-scale macromaps, respectively in the left occipito-temporal and bilateral intraparietal cortex. Furthermore, recent fMRI studies reveal a systematic architecture within these areas. To explain this paradoxical cerebral invariance of cultural maps, we propose a neuronal recycling hypothesis, according to which cultural inventions invade evolutionarily older brain circuits and inherit many of their structural constraints.

AB  - Summary
Higher-order thalamic nuclei receive input from both the cerebral cortex and prethalamic sensory pathways. However, at rest these nuclei appear silent due to inhibitory input from extrathalamic regions, and it has therefore remained unclear how sensory gating of these nuclei takes place. In the rodent, the ventral division of the zona incerta (ZIv) serves as a relay station within the paralemniscal thalamocortical projection pathway for whisker-driven motor activity. Most, perhaps all, ZIv neurons are GABAergic, and recent studies have shown that these cells participate in a feedforward inhibitory circuit that blocks sensory transmission in the thalamus. The present study provides evidence that the stimulation of the vibrissa motor cortex suppresses vibrissal responses in ZIv via an intra-incertal GABAergic circuit. These results provide support for the proposal that sensory transmission operates via a top-down disinhibitory mechanism that is contingent on motor activity.

AB  - Summary
We have analyzed the molecular basis of sugar reception in Drosophila. We define the response spectrum, concentration dependence, and temporal dynamics of sugar-sensing neurons. Using in situ hybridization and reporter gene expression, we identify members of the Gr5a-related taste receptor subfamily that are coexpressed in sugar neurons. Neurons expressing reporters of different Gr5a-related genes send overlapping but distinct projections to the brain and thoracic ganglia. Genetic analysis of receptor genes shows that Gr5a is required for response to one subset of sugars and Gr64a for response to a complementary subset. A Gr5a;Gr64a double mutant shows no physiological or behavioral responses to any tested sugar. The simplest interpretation of our results is that Gr5a and Gr64a are each capable of functioning independently of each other within individual sugar neurons and that they are the primary receptors used in the labellum to detect sugars.

AB  - Summary
Symmetric cell divisions have been proposed to rapidly increase neuronal number late in neurogenesis, but how critical this mode of division is to establishing a specific neuronal layer is unknown. Using in vivo time-lapse imaging methods, we discovered that in the laminated zebrafish retina, the horizontal cell (HC) layer forms quickly during embryonic development upon division of a precursor cell population. The precursor cells morphologically resemble immature, postmitotic HCs and express HC markers such as ptf1a and Prox1 prior to division. These precursors undergo nonapical symmetric division at the laminar location where mature HCs contact photoreceptors. Strikingly, the precursor cell type we observed generates exclusively HCs. We have thus identified a dedicated HC precursor, and our findings suggest a mechanism of neuronal layer formation whereby the location of mitosis could facilitate rapid contact between synaptic partners.

AB  - Summary
Centrosome- and microtubule-associated proteins have been shown to be important for maintaining the neural progenitor pool during neocortical development by regulating the mitotic spindle. It remains unclear whether these proteins may control neurogenesis by regulating other microtubule-dependent processes such as nuclear migration. Here, we identify Cep120, a centrosomal protein preferentially expressed in neural progenitors during neocortical development. We demonstrate that silencing Cep120 in the developing neocortex impairs both interkinetic nuclear migration (INM), a characteristic pattern of nuclear movement in neural progenitors, and neural progenitor self-renewal. Furthermore, we show that Cep120 interacts with transforming acidic coiled-coil proteins (TACCs) and that silencing TACCs also causes defects in INM and neural progenitor self-renewal. Our data suggest a critical role for Cep120 and TACCs in both INM and neurogenesis. We propose that sustaining INM may be a mechanism by which microtubule-regulating proteins maintain the neural progenitor pool during neocortical development.

AB  - A traditional view of the motor cortex in the primate brain is that it contains a map of the body arranged across the cortical surface. This traditional topographic scheme, however, does not capture the actual pattern of overlaps, fractures, re-representations, and multiple areas separated by fuzzy borders. Here, we suggest that the organization of the motor cortex, premotor cortex, supplementary motor cortex, frontal eye field, and supplementary eye field can in principle be understood as a best-fit rendering of the motor repertoire onto the two-dimensional cortical sheet in a manner that optimizes local continuity.

AB  - Summary
In the eye, visual information is segregated into modalities such as color and motion, these being transferred to the central brain through separate channels. Here, we genetically dissect the achromatic motion channel in the fly Drosophila melanogaster at the level of the first relay station in the brain, the lamina, where it is split into four parallel pathways (L1-L3, amc/T1). The functional relevance of this divergence is little understood. We now show that the two most prominent pathways, L1 and L2, together are necessary and largely sufficient for motion-dependent behavior. At high pattern contrast, the two pathways are redundant. At intermediate contrast, they mediate motion stimuli of opposite polarity, L2 front-to-back, L1 back-to-front motion. At low contrast, L1 and L2 depend upon each other for motion processing. Of the two minor pathways, amc/T1 specifically enhances the L1 pathway at intermediate contrast. L3 appears not to contribute to motion but to orientation behavior.

AB  - Summary
The nematode C. elegans provides a powerful model system for exploring the molecular basis of synaptogenesis and neurotransmission. However, the lack of direct functional assays of release processes has largely prevented an in depth understanding of the mechanism of vesicular exocytosis and endocytosis in C. elegans. We address this technical limitation by developing direct electrophysiological assays, including membrane capacitance and amperometry measurements, in primary cultured C. elegans neurons. In addition, we have succeeded in monitoring the docking and fusion of single dense core vesicles (DCVs) employing total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. With these approaches and mutant perturbation analysis, we provide direct evidence that UNC-31 is required for the docking of DCVs at the plasma membrane. Interestingly, the defect in DCV docking caused by UNC-31 mutation can be fully rescued by PKA activation. We also demonstrate that UNC-31 is required for UNC-13-mediated augmentation of DCV exocytosis.

AB  - Summary
Maps of sensory receptor epithelia and computed features of the sensory environment are common elements of auditory, visual, and somatic sensory representations from the periphery to the cerebral cortex. Maps enhance the understanding of normal neural organization and its modification by pathology and experience. They underlie the derivation of the computational principles that govern sensory processing and the generation of perception. Despite their intuitive explanatory power, the functions of and rules for organizing maps and their plasticity are not well understood. Some puzzles of auditory cortical map organization are that few complete receptor maps are available and that even fewer computational maps are known beyond primary cortical areas. Neuroanatomical evidence suggests equally organized connectional patterns throughout the cortical hierarchy that might underlie map stability. Here, we consider the implications of auditory cortical map organization and its plasticity and evaluate the complementary role of maps in representation and computation from an auditory perspective.

AB  - Two qualitatively different kinds of neural map have been described: continuous maps exemplified by the visual retinotopic map, and discrete maps exemplified by the olfactory glomerular map. Here, we review developmental mechanisms of retinotopic and olfactory glomerular mapping and discuss underlying commonalities that have emerged from recent studies. These include the use of molecular gradients, axon-axon interactions, and the interplay between labeling molecules and neuronal activity in establishing these maps. Since visual retinotopic and olfactory glomerular maps represent two ends of a continuum that includes many other types of neural map in between, these emerging general principles may be widely applicable to map formation throughout the nervous system.

AB  - Although the neurobiology of autism has been studied for more than two decades, the majority of these studies have examined brain structure 10, 20, or more years after the onset of clinical symptoms. The pathological biology that causes autism remains unknown, but its signature is likely to be most evident during the first years of life when clinical symptoms are emerging. This review highlights neurobiological findings during the first years of life and emphasizes early brain overgrowth as a key factor in the pathobiology of autism. We speculate that excess neuron numbers may be one possible cause of early brain overgrowth and produce defects in neural patterning and wiring, with exuberant local and short-distance cortical interactions impeding the function of large-scale, long-distance interactions between brain regions. Because large-scale networks underlie socio-emotional and communication functions, such alterations in brain architecture could relate to the early clinical manifestations of autism. As such, autism may additionally provide unique insight into genetic and developmental processes that shape early neural wiring patterns and make possible higher-order social, emotional, and communication functions.

AB  - Summary
The physiological conditions under which adenosine A2A receptors modulate synaptic transmission are presently unclear. We show that A2A receptors are localized postsynaptically at synapses between mossy fibers and CA3 pyramidal cells and are essential for a form of long-term potentiation (LTP) of NMDA-EPSCs induced by short bursts of mossy fiber stimulation. This LTP spares AMPA-EPSCs and is likely induced and expressed postsynaptically. It depends on a postsynaptic Ca2+ rise, on G protein activation, and on Src kinase. In addition to A2A receptors, LTP of NMDA-EPSCs requires the activation of NMDA and mGluR5 receptors as potential sources of Ca2+ increase. LTP of NMDA-EPSCs displays a lower threshold for induction as compared with the conventional presynaptic mossy fiber LTP; however, the two forms of LTP can combine with stronger induction protocols. Thus, postsynaptic A2A receptors may potentially affect information processing in CA3 neuronal networks and memory performance.

AB  - Summary
Acetylcholine is a ubiquitous cortical neuromodulator implicated in cognition. In order to understand the potential for acetylcholine to play a role in visual attention, we studied nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) localization and function in area V1 of the macaque. We found nAChRs presynaptically at thalamic synapses onto excitatory, but not inhibitory, neurons in the primary thalamorecipient layer 4c. Furthermore, consistent with the release enhancement suggested by this localization, we discovered that nicotine increases responsiveness and lowers contrast threshold in layer 4c neurons. We also found that nAChRs are expressed by GABAergic interneurons in V1 but rarely by pyramidal neurons, and that nicotine suppresses visual responses outside layer 4c. All sensory systems incorporate gain control mechanisms, or processes which dynamically alter input/output relationships. We demonstrate that at the site of thalamic input to visual cortex, the effect of this nAChR-mediated gain is an enhancement of the detection of visual stimuli.

AB  - Summary
Cognitive decline is commonly observed in advanced aging even in the absence of disease. Here we explore the possibility that normal aging is accompanied by disruptive alterations in the coordination of large-scale brain systems that support high-level cognition. In 93 adults aged 18 to 93, we demonstrate that aging is characterized by marked reductions in normally present functional correlations within two higher-order brain systems. Anterior to posterior components within the default network were most severely disrupted with age. Furthermore, correlation reductions were severe in older adults free from Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology as determined by amyloid imaging, suggesting that functional disruptions were not the result of AD. Instead, reduced correlations were associated with disruptions in white matter integrity and poor cognitive performance across a range of domains. These results suggest that cognitive decline in normal aging arises from functional disruption in the coordination of large-scale brain systems that support cognition.

AB  - Summary
The neuron-specific K-Cl cotransporter, KCC2, induces a developmental shift to render GABAergic transmission from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing. Now we demonstrate that KCC2, independently of its Cl− transport function, is a key factor in the maturation of dendritic spines. This morphogenic role of KCC2 in the development of excitatory synapses is mediated by structural interactions between KCC2 and the spine cytoskeleton. Here, the binding of KCC2 C-terminal domain to the cytoskeleton-associated protein 4.1N may play an important role. A more general conclusion based on our data is that KCC2 acts as a synchronizing factor in the functional development of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses in cortical neurons and networks.

Two groups of participants, one susceptible to posthypnotic amnesia (PHA) and the other not, viewed a movie. A week later, they underwent hypnosis in the fMRI scanner and received a suggestion to forget the movie details after hypnosis until receiving a reversal cue. The participants were tested twice for memory for the movie and for the context in which it was shown, under the posthypnotic suggestion and after its reversal, while their brain was scanned. The PHA group showed reduced memory for movie but not for context while under suggestion. Activity in occipital, temporal, and prefrontal areas differed among the groups, and, in the PHA group, between suggestion and reversal conditions. We propose that whereas some of these regions subserve retrieval of long-term episodic memory, others are involved in inhibiting retrieval, possibly already in a preretrieval monitoring stage. Similar mechanisms may also underlie other forms of functional amnesia.

AB  - Summary
Synaptogenesis is a highly regulated process that underlies formation of neural circuitry. Considerable work has demonstrated the capability of some adhesion molecules, such as SynCAM and Neurexins/Neuroligins, to induce synapse formation in vitro. Furthermore, Cdk5 gain of function results in an increased number of synapses in vivo. To gain a better understanding of how Cdk5 might promote synaptogenesis, we investigated potential crosstalk between Cdk5 and the cascade of events mediated by synapse-inducing proteins. One protein recruited to developing terminals by SynCAM and Neurexins/Neuroligins is the MAGUK family member CASK. We found that Cdk5 phosphorylates and regulates CASK distribution to membranes. In the absence of Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation, CASK is not recruited to developing synapses and thus fails to interact with essential presynaptic components. Functional consequences include alterations in calcium influx. Mechanistically, Cdk5 regulates the interaction between CASK and liprin-α. These results provide a molecular explanation of how Cdk5 can promote synaptogenesis.

AB  - Summary
Imaging studies are consistent with the existence of brain regions specialized for color, but electrophysiological studies have produced conflicting results. Here we address the neural basis for color, using targeted single-unit recording in alert macaque monkeys, guided by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the same subjects. Distributed within posterior inferior temporal cortex, a large region encompassing V4, PITd, and posterior TEO that some have proposed functions as a single visual complex, we found color-biased fMRI hotspots that we call “globs,” each several millimeters wide. Almost all cells located in globs showed strong luminance-invariant color tuning and some shape selectivity. Cells in different globs represented distinct visual field locations, consistent with the coarse retinotopy of this brain region. Cells in “interglob” regions were not color tuned, but were more strongly shape selective. Neither population was direction selective. These results suggest that color perception is mediated by specialized neurons that are clustered within the extrastriate brain.

AB  - Summary
The brain's perceptual stimuli are constantly changing: some of these changes are treated as invariances and are suppressed, whereas others are selectively amplified, giving emphasis to the distinctions that matter most. The starkest form of such amplification is categorical perception. In speech, for example, a continuum of phonetic stimuli gets carved into perceptually distinct categories. We used fMRI to measure the degree to which this process of selective amplification takes place. The most categorically processing area was the left supramarginal gyrus: stimuli from different phonetic categories, when presented together in a contrasting pair, were neurally amplified more than two-fold. Low-level auditory cortical areas, however, showed comparatively little amplification of changes that crossed category boundaries. Selective amplification serves to emphasize key stimulus differences, thereby shaping perceptual categories. The approach presented here provides a quantitative way to measure the degree to which such processing is taking place.

AB  - Some GABAA receptors (GABAARs) are activated by low transmitter levels present in the extracellular space and generate an uninterrupted conductance referred to as “tonic.” This tonic conductance is highly sensitive to all factors regulating the amount of GABA surrounding the neurons. Only a few GABAARs with particular subunit combinations are well suited to mediate the tonic conductance. These same receptors constitute important and specific targets for various endogenous and exogenous neuroactive compounds and possible therapeutic targets.

AB  - The major part of the brain's energy budget (∼60%–80%) is devoted to its communication activities. While inhibition is critical to brain function, relatively little attention has been paid to its metabolic costs. Understanding how inhibitory interneurons contribute to brain energy consumption (brain work) is not only of interest in understanding a fundamental aspect of brain function but also in understanding functional brain imaging techniques which rely on measurements related to blood flow and metabolism. Herein we examine issues relevant to an assessment of the work performed by inhibitory interneurons in the service of brain function.

AB  - Summary
The neuroligins are postsynaptic cell adhesion proteins whose associations with presynaptic neurexins participate in synaptogenesis. Mutations in the neuroligin and neurexin genes appear to be associated with autism and mental retardation. The crystal structure of a neuroligin reveals features not found in its catalytically active relatives, such as the fully hydrophobic interface forming the functional neuroligin dimer; the conformations of surface loops surrounding the vestigial active center; the location of determinants that are critical for folding and processing; and the absence of a macromolecular dipole and presence of an electronegative, hydrophilic surface for neurexin binding. The structure of a β-neurexin-neuroligin complex reveals the precise orientation of the bound neurexin and, despite a limited resolution, provides substantial information on the Ca2+-dependent interactions network involved in trans-synaptic neurexin-neuroligin association. These structures exemplify how an α/β-hydrolase fold varies in surface topography to confer adhesion properties and provide templates for analyzing abnormal processing or recognition events associated with autism.

AB  - Summary
The receptor tyrosine kinase, TrkB, is critical to diverse functions of the mammalian nervous system in health and disease. Evidence of TrkB activation during epileptogenesis in vivo despite genetic deletion of its prototypic neurotrophin ligands led us to hypothesize that a non-neurotrophin, the divalent cation zinc, can transactivate TrkB. We found that zinc activates TrkB through increasing Src family kinase activity by an activity-regulated mechanism independent of neurotrophins. One subcellular locale at which zinc activates TrkB is the postsynaptic density of excitatory synapses. Exogenous zinc potentiates the efficacy of the hippocampal mossy fiber (mf)-CA3 pyramid synapse by a TrkB-requiring mechanism. Long-term potentiation of this synapse is impaired by deletion of TrkB, inhibition of TrkB kinase activity, and by CaEDTA, a selective chelator of zinc. The activity-dependent activation of synaptic TrkB in a neurotrophin-independent manner provides a mechanism by which this receptor can regulate synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Summary
The firing pattern of neurons is shaped by the convergence of excitation and inhibition, each with finely tuned magnitude and duration. In an auditory brainstem nucleus, glycinergic inhibition features fast decay kinetics, the mechanism of which is unknown. By applying glycine to native or recombinant glycine receptors, we show that response decay times are accelerated by addition of GABA, a weak partial agonist of glycine receptors. Systematic variation in agonist exposure time revealed that fast synaptic time course may be achieved with submillisecond exposures to mixtures of glycine and GABA at physiological concentrations. Accordingly, presynaptic terminals generally contained both transmitters, and depleting terminals of GABA slowed glycinergic synaptic currents. Thus, coreleased GABA accelerates glycinergic transmission by acting directly on glycine receptors, narrowing the time window for effective inhibition. Packaging both weak and strong agonists in vesicles may be a general means by which presynaptic neurons regulate the duration of postsynaptic responses.

AB  - Summary
In complex visual scenes, linking related contour elements is important for object recognition. This process, thought to be stimulus driven and hard wired, has substrates in primary visual cortex (V1). Here, however, we find contour integration in V1 to depend strongly on perceptual learning and top-down influences that are specific to contour detection. In naive monkeys, the information about contours embedded in complex backgrounds is absent in V1 neuronal responses and is independent of the locus of spatial attention. Training animals to find embedded contours induces strong contour-related responses specific to the trained retinotopic region. These responses are most robust when animals perform the contour detection task but disappear under anesthesia. Our findings suggest that top-down influences dynamically adapt neural circuits according to specific perceptual tasks. This may serve as a general neuronal mechanism of perceptual learning and reflect top-down mediated changes in cortical states.

AB  - Summary
Endocannabinoids are well established as inhibitors of chemical synaptic transmission via presynaptic activation of the cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R). Contrasting this notion, we show that dendritic release of endocannabinoids mediates potentiation of synaptic transmission at mixed (electrical and chemical) synaptic contacts on the goldfish Mauthner cell. Remarkably, the observed enhancement was not restricted to the glutamatergic component of the synaptic response but also included a parallel increase in electrical transmission. This effect involved the activation of CB1 receptors and was indirectly mediated via the release of dopamine from nearby varicosities, which in turn led to potentiation of the synaptic response via a cAMP-dependent protein kinase-mediated postsynaptic mechanism. Thus, endocannabinoid release can potentiate synaptic transmission, and its functional roles include the regulation of gap junction-mediated electrical synapses. Similar interactions between endocannabinoid and dopaminergic systems may be widespread and potentially relevant for the motor and rewarding effects of cannabis derivatives.

AB  - Summary
Endocytosis of AMPA receptors and other postsynaptic cargo occurs at endocytic zones (EZs), stably positioned sites of clathrin adjacent to the postsynaptic density (PSD). The tight localization of postsynaptic endocytosis is thought to control spine composition and regulate synaptic transmission. However, the mechanisms that situate the EZ near the PSD and the role of spine endocytosis in synaptic transmission are unknown. Here, we report that a physical link between dynamin-3 and the postsynaptic adaptor Homer positions the EZ near the PSD. Disruption of dynamin-3 or its interaction with Homer uncouples the PSD from the EZ, resulting in synapses lacking postsynaptic clathrin. Loss of the EZ leads to a loss of synaptic AMPA receptors and reduced excitatory synaptic transmission that corresponds with impaired synaptic recycling. Thus, a physical link between the PSD and the EZ ensures localized endocytosis and recycling by recapturing and maintaining a proximate pool of cycling AMPA receptors.

AB  - Summary
Ripples are sharp-wave-associated field oscillations (100–300 Hz) recorded in the hippocampus during behavioral immobility and slow-wave sleep. In epileptic rats and humans, a different and faster oscillation (200–600Hz), termed fast ripples, has been described. However, the basic mechanisms are unknown. Here, we propose that fast ripples emerge from a disorganized ripple pattern caused by unreliable firing in the epileptic hippocampus. Enhanced synaptic activity is responsible for the irregular bursting of CA3 pyramidal cells due to large membrane potential fluctuations. Lower field interactions and a reduced spike-timing reliability concur with decreased spatial synchronization and the emergence of fast ripples. Reducing synaptically driven membrane potential fluctuations improves both spike-timing reliability and spatial synchronization and restores ripples in the epileptic hippocampus. Conversely, a lower spike-timing reliability, with reduced potassium currents, is associated with ripple shuffling in normal hippocampus. Therefore, fast ripples may reflect a pathological desynchronization of the normal ripple pattern.

AB  - Summary
Activity-dependent regulation of dendritic protein synthesis is critical for enduring changes in synaptic function, but how the unique features of distinct activity patterns are decoded by the dendritic translation machinery remains poorly understood. Here, we identify eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF2), which catalyzes ribosomal translocation during protein synthesis, as a biochemical sensor in dendrites that is specifically and locally tuned to the quality of neurotransmission. We show that intrinsic action potential (AP)-mediated network activity in cultured hippocampal neurons maintains eEF2 in a relatively dephosphorylated (active) state, whereas spontaneous neurotransmitter release (i.e., miniature neurotransmission) strongly promotes the phosphorylation (and inactivation) of eEF2. The regulation of eEF2 phosphorylation is responsive to bidirectional changes in miniature neurotransmission and is controlled locally in dendrites. Finally, direct spatially controlled inhibition of eEF2 phosphorylation induces local translational activation, suggesting that eEF2 is a biochemical sensor that couples miniature synaptic events to local translational suppression in neuronal dendrites.

AB  - Summary
Action potentials are binary signals that transmit information via their rate and temporal pattern. In this context, the axon is thought of as a transmission line, devoid of a role in neuronal computation. Here, we show a highly localized role of axonal Kv1 potassium channels in shaping the action potential waveform in the axon initial segment (AIS) of layer 5 pyramidal neurons independent of the soma. Cell-attached recordings revealed a 10-fold increase in Kv1 channel density over the first 50 μm of the AIS. Inactivation of AIS and proximal axonal Kv1 channels, as occurs during slow subthreshold somatodendritic depolarizations, led to a distance-dependent broadening of axonal action potentials, as well as an increase in synaptic strength at proximal axonal terminals. Thus, Kv1 channels are strategically positioned to integrate slow subthreshold signals, providing control of the presynaptic action potential waveform and synaptic coupling in local cortical circuits.

Although much is known about acute modulation of these channels by second messengers, the mechanisms that control their trafficking to and from the plasma membrane remain poorly understood. In this issue of Neuron, Green and colleagues demonstrate that the opening of L-type calcium channels results in negative feedback regulation due to their calcium-dependent internalization.

AB  - Summary
Cadherin-mediated interactions are integral to synapse formation and potentiation. Here we show that N-cadherin is required for memory formation and regulation of a subset of underlying biochemical processes. N-cadherin antagonistic peptide containing the His-Ala-Val motif (HAV-N) transiently disrupted hippocampal N-cadherin dimerization and impaired the formation of long-term contextual fear memory while sparing short-term memory, retrieval, and extinction. HAV-N impaired the learning-induced phosphorylation of a distinctive, cytoskeletally associated fraction of hippocampal Erk-1/2 and altered the distribution of IQGAP1, a scaffold protein linking cadherin-mediated cell adhesion to the cytoskeleton. This effect was accompanied by reduction of N-cadherin/IQGAP1/Erk-2 interactions. Similarly, in primary neuronal cultures, HAV-N prevented NMDA-induced dendritic Erk-1/2 phosphorylation and caused relocation of IQGAP1 from dendritic spines into the shafts. The data suggest that the newly identified role of hippocampal N-cadherin in memory consolidation may be mediated, at least in part, by cytoskeletal IQGAP1/Erk signaling.

AB  - Summary
It is well known that pain attracts attention and interferes with cognition. Given that the mechanisms behind this phenomenon are largely unknown, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and presented visual objects with or without concomitant pain stimuli. To test for the specificity of pain, we compared this modulatory effect with a previously established modulatory effect of working memory on visual object processing. Our data showed a comparable behavioral effect of both types of modulation and identified the lateral occipital complex (LOC) as the site of modulation in the ventral visual stream, for both pain and working memory. However, the sources of these modulatory effects differed for the two processes. Whereas the source of modulation for working memory could be attributed to the parietal cortex, the modulatory effect of pain was observed in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), an area ideally suited to link pain perception and attentional control.

AB  - Summary
Mammalian neural stem cells (NSCs) have the capacity to both self-renew and to generate all the neuronal and glial cell-types of the adult nervous system. Global chromatin changes accompany the transition from proliferating NSCs to committed neuronal lineages, but the mechanisms involved have been unclear. Using a proteomics approach, we show that a switch in subunit composition of neural, ATP-dependent SWI/SNF-like chromatin remodeling complexes accompanies this developmental transition. Proliferating neural stem and progenitor cells express complexes in which BAF45a, a Krüppel/PHD domain protein and the actin-related protein BAF53a are quantitatively associated with the SWI2/SNF2-like ATPases, Brg and Brm. As neural progenitors exit the cell cycle, these subunits are replaced by the homologous BAF45b, BAF45c, and BAF53b. BAF45a/53a subunits are necessary and sufficient for neural progenitor proliferation. Preventing the subunit switch impairs neuronal differentiation, indicating that this molecular event is essential for the transition from neural stem/progenitors to postmitotic neurons. More broadly, these studies suggest that SWI/SNF-like complexes in vertebrates achieve biological specificity by combinatorial assembly of their subunits.

AB  - Summary
Synaptogenesis requires recruitment of neurotransmitter receptors to developing postsynaptic specializations. We developed a coculture system reconstituting artificial synapses between neurons and nonneuronal cells to investigate the molecular components required for AMPA-receptor recruitment to synapses. With this system, we find that excitatory axons specifically express factors that recruit the AMPA receptor GluR4 subunit to sites of contact between axons and GluR4-transfected nonneuronal cells. Furthermore, the N-terminal domain (NTD) of GluR4 is necessary and sufficient for its recruitment to these artificial synapses and also for GluR4 recruitment to native synapses. Moreover, we show that axonally derived neuronal pentraxins NP1 and NPR are required for GluR4 recruitment to artificial and native synapses. RNAi knockdown and knockout of the neuronal pentraxins significantly decreases GluR4 targeting to synapses. Our results indicate that NP1 and NPR secreted from presynaptic neurons bind to the GluR4 NTD and are critical trans-synaptic factors for GluR4 recruitment to synapses.

Progenitors within the ventral telencephalon can generate GABAergic neurons and oligodendrocytes, but regulation of the neuron-glial switch is poorly understood. We investigated the combinatorial expression and function of Dlx1&amp;2, Olig2, and Mash1 transcription factors in the ventral telencephalon. We show that Dlx homeobox transcription factors, required for GABAergic interneuron production, repress oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) formation by acting on a common progenitor to determine neuronal versus oligodendroglial cell fate acquisition. We demonstrate that Dlx1&amp;2 negatively regulate Olig2-dependant OPC formation and that Mash1 promotes OPC formation by restricting the number of Dlx+ progenitors. Progenitors transplanted from Dlx1&amp;2 mutant ventral telencephalon into newborn wild-type mice do not produce neurons but differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes that survive into adulthood. Our results identify another role for Dlx genes as modulators of neuron versus oligodendrocyte development in the ventral embryonic forebrain.

AB  - Summary
The vertebrate brain is anatomically and functionally asymmetric; however, the molecular mechanisms that establish left-right brain patterning are largely unknown. In zebrafish, asymmetric left-sided Nodal signaling within the developing dorsal diencephalon is required for determining the direction of epithalamic asymmetries. Here, we show that Six3, a transcription factor essential for forebrain formation and associated with holoprosencephaly in humans, regulates diencephalic Nodal activity during initial establishment of brain asymmetry. Reduction of Six3 function causes brain-specific deregulation of Nodal pathway activity, resulting in epithalamic laterality defects. Based on misexpression and genetic epistasis experiments, we propose that Six3 acts in the neuroectoderm to establish a prepattern of bilateral repression of Nodal activity. Subsequently, Nodal signaling from the left lateral plate mesoderm alleviates this repression ipsilaterally. Our data reveal a Six3-dependent mechanism for establishment of correct brain laterality and provide an entry point to understanding the genetic regulation of Nodal signaling in the brain.

Previous studies suggest that glia may be required for normal circadian behavior, but glial factors required for rhythmicity have not been identified in any system. We show here that a circadian rhythm in Drosophila Ebony (N-β-alanyl-biogenic amine synthetase) abundance can be visualized in adult glia and that glial expression of Ebony rescues the altered circadian behavior of ebony mutants. We demonstrate that molecular oscillator function and clock neuron output are normal in ebony mutants, verifying a role for Ebony downstream of the clock. Surprisingly, the ebony oscillation persists in flies lacking PDF neuropeptide, indicating it is regulated by an autonomous glial oscillator or another neuronal factor. The proximity of Ebony-containing glia to aminergic neurons and genetic interaction results suggest a function in dopaminergic signaling. We thus suggest a model for ebony function wherein Ebony glia participate in the clock control of dopaminergic function and the orchestration of circadian activity rhythms.

AB  - Summary
Thalamic relay cells transmit information from retina to cortex by firing either rapid bursts or tonic trains of spikes. Bursts occur when the membrane voltage is low, as during sleep, because they depend on channels that cannot respond to excitatory input unless they are primed by strong hyperpolarization. Cells fire tonically when depolarized, as during waking. Thus, mode of firing is usually associated with behavioral state. Growing evidence, however, suggests that sensory processing involves both burst and tonic spikes. To ask if visually evoked synaptic responses induce each type of firing, we recorded intracellular responses to natural movies from relay cells and developed methods to map the receptive fields of the excitation and inhibition that the images evoked. In addition to tonic spikes, the movies routinely elicited lasting inhibition from the center of the receptive field that permitted bursts to fire. Therefore, naturally evoked patterns of synaptic input engage dual modes of firing.

AB  - Summary
Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a recently described neurodegenerative disorder of older adult carriers of premutation alleles (60–200 CGG repeats) in the fragile X mental retardation gene (FMR1). It has been proposed that FXTAS is an RNA-mediated neurodegenerative disease caused by the titration of RNA-binding proteins by the CGG repeats. To test this hypothesis, we utilize a transgenic Drosophila model of FXTAS that expresses a premutation-length repeat (90 CGG repeats) from the 5′ UTR of the human FMR1 gene and displays neuronal degeneration. Here, we show that overexpression of RNA-binding proteins hnRNP A2/B1 and CUGBP1 suppresses the phenotype of the CGG transgenic fly. Furthermore, we show that hnRNP A2/B1 directly interacts with riboCGG repeats and that the CUGBP1 protein interacts with the riboCGG repeats via hnRNP A2/B1.

AB  - Summary
To discover new genes involved in axon navigation, we conducted a forward genetic screen for recessive alleles affecting motor neuron pathfinding in GFP reporter mice mutagenized with ENU. In Magellan mutant embryos, motor axons were error prone and wandered inefficiently at choice points within embryos, but paradoxically responded to guidance cues with normal sensitivity in vitro. We mapped the Magellan mutation to the Phr1 gene encoding a large multidomain E3 ubiquitin ligase. Phr1 is associated with the microtubule cytoskeleton within neurons and selectively localizes to axons but is excluded from growth cones. Motor and sensory neurons from Magellan mutants display abnormal morphologies due to a breakdown in the polarized distribution of components that segregate between axons and growth cones. The Magellan phenotype can be reversed by stabilizing microtubules with taxol or inhibiting p38MAPK activity. Thus, efficacious pathfinding requires Phr1 activity for coordinating the cytoskeletal organization that distinguishes axons from growth cones.

CF ascending branches innervate Purkinje cells while CF transverse branches show a near complete failure to form conventional synapses. Time-lapse imaging over hours or days revealed that ascending branches were very stable. However, transverse branches were highly dynamic, exhibiting rapid elongation and retraction and varicosity turnover. Thus, different branches of the same axon, with different innervation patterns, display branch type-specific motility in the adult cerebellum. Furthermore, dynamic changes in transverse branch length were almost completely suppressed by pharmacological stimulation of olivary firing.

AB  - Summary
Synaptic NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) play important roles in synaptic plasticity, brain development, and pathology. In the last few years, the view of NMDARs as relatively fixed components of the postsynaptic density has changed. A number of studies have now shown that both the number of receptors and their subunit compositions can be altered. During development, the synaptic NMDARs subunit composition changes, switching from predominance of NR2B-containing to NR2A-containing receptors, but little is known about the mechanisms involved in this developmental process. Here, we report that, depending on the pattern of NMDAR activation, the subunit composition of synaptic NMDARs is under extremely rapid, bidirectional control at neonatal synapses. This switching, which is at least as rapid as that seen with AMPARs, will have immediate and dramatic consequences on the integrative capacity of the synapse.

AB  - Summary
Neurons integrate and encode complex synaptic inputs into action potential outputs through a process termed “intrinsic excitability.” Here, we report the essential contribution of fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs), a family of voltage-gated sodium channel binding proteins, to this process. Fhf1−/−Fhf4−/− mice suffer from severe ataxia and other neurological deficits. In mouse cerebellar slice recordings, WT granule neurons can be induced to fire action potentials repetitively (∼60 Hz), whereas Fhf1−/−Fhf4−/− neurons often fire only once and at an elevated voltage spike threshold. Sodium channels in Fhf1−/−Fhf4−/− granule neurons inactivate at more negative membrane potential, inactivate more rapidly, and are slower to recover from the inactivated state. Altered sodium channel physiology is sufficient to explain excitation deficits, as tested in a granule cell computer model. These findings offer a physiological mechanism underlying human spinocerebellar ataxia induced by Fhf4 mutation and suggest a broad role for FHFs in the control of excitability throughout the CNS.

AB  - Summary
Nodal activity in the left lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) is required to activate left-sided Nodal signaling in the epithalamic region of the zebrafish forebrain. Epithalamic Nodal signaling subsequently determines the laterality of neuroanatomical asymmetries. We show that overactivation of Wnt/Axin1/β-catenin signaling during late gastrulation leads to bilateral epithalamic expression of Nodal pathway genes independently of LPM Nodal signaling. This is consistent with a model whereby epithalamic Nodal signaling is normally bilaterally repressed, with Nodal signaling from the LPM unilaterally alleviating repression. We suggest that Wnt signaling regulates the establishment of the bilateral repression. We identify a second role for the Wnt pathway in the left/right regulation of LPM Nodal pathway gene expression, and finally, we show that at later stages Axin1 is required for the elaboration of concordant neuroanatomical asymmetries.

AB  - Clinical pain is a serious public health issue. Treatment of pain-related suffering requires knowledge of how pain signals are initially interpreted and subsequently transmitted and perpetuated. This review article is one of three reviews in this issue of Neuron that address our understanding of the pain process and possible solutions to the problem from both cellular- and systems-level viewpoints.

The electrophysiological properties of peripheral neurons activated by noxious stimuli, the primary afferent nociceptors, have been investigated intensively, and our knowledge about the molecular basis of transducers for noxious stimuli has increased greatly. In contrast, understanding of the intracellular signaling mechanisms regulating nociceptor sensitization downstream of ligand binding to the receptors is still at a relatively nascent stage. After outlining the initiated signaling cascades, we discuss the emerging plasticity within these cascades and the importance of subcellular compartmentalization. In addition, the recently realized importance of functional interactions with the extracellular matrix, cytoskeleton, intracellular organelles such as mitochondria, and sex hormones will be introduced. This burgeoning literature establishes new cellular features crucial for the function of nociceptive neurons and argues that additional focus should be placed on understanding the complex integration of cellular events that make up the “cell biology of pain.”

AB  - Summary
C. elegans RPM-1 (for Regulator of Presynaptic Morphology) is a member of a conserved protein family that includes Drosophila Highwire and mammalian Pam and Phr1. These are large proteins recently shown to regulate synaptogenesis through E3 ubiquitin ligase activities. Here, we report the identification of an RCC1-like guanine nucleotide exchange factor, GLO-4, from mass spectrometry analysis of RPM-1-associated proteins. GLO-4 colocalizes with RPM-1 at presynaptic terminals. Loss of function in glo-4 or in its target Rab GTPase, glo-1, causes neuronal defects resembling those in rpm-1 mutants. We show that the glo pathway functions downstream of rpm-1 and acts in parallel to fsn-1, a partner of RPM-1 E3 ligase function. We find that late endosomes are specifically disorganized at the presynaptic terminals of glo-4 mutants. Our data suggest that RPM-1 positively regulates a Rab GTPase pathway to promote vesicular trafficking via late endosomes.

AB  - Summary
Somatosensory information from the face is transmitted to the brain by trigeminal sensory neurons. It was previously unknown whether neurons innervating distinct areas of the face possess molecular differences. We have identified a set of genes differentially expressed along the dorsoventral axis of the embryonic mouse trigeminal ganglion and thus can be considered trigeminal positional identity markers. Interestingly, establishing some of the spatial patterns requires signals from the developing face. We identified bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) as one of these target-derived factors and showed that spatially defined retrograde BMP signaling controls the differential gene expressions in trigeminal neurons through both Smad4-independent and Smad4-dependent pathways. Mice lacking one of the BMP4-regulated transcription factors, Onecut2 (OC2), have defects in the trigeminal central projections representing the whiskers. Our results provide molecular evidence for both spatial patterning and retrograde regulation of gene expression in sensory neurons during the development of the somatosensory map.

AB  - Summary
The principles driving the organization of the ventral object-processing stream remain unknown. Here, we show that stimulus-specific repetition suppression (RS) in one region of the ventral stream is biased according to motor-relevant properties of objects. Quantitative analysis confirmed that this result was not confounded with similarity in visual shape. A similar pattern of biases in RS according to motor-relevant properties of objects was observed in dorsal stream regions in the left hemisphere. These findings suggest that neural specificity for “tools” in the ventral stream is driven by similarity metrics computed over motor-relevant information represented in dorsal structures. Support for this view is provided by converging results from functional connectivity analyses of the fMRI data and a separate neuropsychological study. More generally, these data suggest that a basic organizing principle giving rise to “category specificity” in the ventral stream may involve similarity metrics computed over information represented elsewhere in the brain.

AB  - Summary
The scaffold protein PSD-95 promotes the maturation and strengthening of excitatory synapses, functions that require proper localization of PSD-95 in the postsynaptic density (PSD). Here we report that phosphorylation of ser-295 enhances the synaptic accumulation of PSD-95 and the ability of PSD-95 to recruit surface AMPA receptors and potentiate excitatory postsynaptic currents. We present evidence that a Rac1-JNK1 signaling pathway mediates ser-295 phosphorylation and regulates synaptic content of PSD-95. Ser-295 phosphorylation is suppressed by chronic elevation, and increased by chronic silencing, of synaptic activity. Rapid dephosphorylation of ser-295 occurs in response to NMDA treatment that causes chemical long-term depression (LTD). Overexpression of a phosphomimicking mutant (S295D) of PSD-95 inhibited NMDA-induced AMPA receptor internalization and blocked the induction of LTD. The data suggest that synaptic strength can be regulated by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of ser-295 of PSD-95 and that synaptic depression requires the dephosphorylation of ser-295.

AB  - Summary
Mammalian cortical development involves neuronal migration and neuritogenesis; this latter process forms the structural precursors to axons and dendrites. Elucidating the pathways that regulate the cytoskeleton to drive these processes is fundamental to our understanding of cortical development. Here we show that loss of all three murine Ena/VASP proteins, a family of actin regulatory proteins, causes neuronal ectopias, alters intralayer positioning in the cortical plate, and, surprisingly, blocks axon fiber tract formation during corticogenesis. Cortical fiber tract defects in the absence of Ena/VASP arise from a failure in neurite initiation, a prerequisite for axon formation. Neurite initiation defects in Ena/VASP-deficient neurons are preceded by a failure to form bundled actin filaments and filopodia. These findings provide insight into the regulation of neurite formation and the role of the actin cytoskeleton during cortical development.

AB  - Summary
Development of appropriate dendritic arbors is crucial for neuronal information transfer. We show, using seizure-related gene 6 (sez-6) null mutant mice, that Sez-6 is required for normal dendritic arborization of cortical neurons. Deep-layer pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex of sez-6 null mice exhibit an excess of short dendrites, and cultured cortical neurons lacking Sez-6 display excessive neurite branching. Overexpression of individual Sez-6 isoforms in knockout neurons reveals opposing actions of membrane-bound and secreted Sez-6 proteins, with membrane-bound Sez-6 exerting an antibranching effect under both basal and depolarizing conditions. Layer V pyramidal neurons in knockout brain slices show reduced excitatory postsynaptic responses and a reduced dendritic spine density, reflected by diminished punctate staining for postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95). In behavioral tests, the sez-6 null mice display specific exploratory, motor, and cognitive deficits. In conclusion, cell-surface protein complexes involving Sez-6 help to sculpt the dendritic arbor, in turn enhancing synaptic connectivity.

The functional relationship between INM and the mode of division of neural progenitors remains elusive, in part because its regulation at the molecular level is poorly understood. In this issue of Neuron, Xie et al. identify two centrosomal proteins (Cep120 and TACCs) regulating the INM of cortical neural progenitors.

AB  - Summary
Membrane depolarization causes voltage-gated ion channels to transition from a resting/closed conformation to an activated/open conformation. We used voltage-clamp fluorometry to measure protein motion at specific regions of the Shaker Kv channel. This enabled us to construct new structural models of the resting/closed and activated/open states based on the Kv1.2 crystal structure using the Rosetta-Membrane method and molecular dynamics simulations. Our models account for the measured gating charge displacement and suggest a molecular mechanism of activation in which the primary voltage sensors, S4s, rotate by ∼180° as they move “outward” by 6–8 Å. A subsequent tilting motion of the S4s and the pore domain helices, S5s, of all four subunits induces a concerted movement of the channel's S4-S5 linkers and S6 helices, allowing ion conduction. Our models are compatible with a wide body of data and resolve apparent contradictions that previously led to several distinct models of voltage sensing.

AB  - The neocortex of mammals is composed of cortical fields that have a unique organization associated with the animal's ecological niche and lifestyle. Each cortical field has a specific pattern of connections with other cortical fields and brain structures, and together they comprise a neocortical network that generates a variety of behaviors. These networks and the behaviors they generate are variable across mammals, and are particularly complex in some species such as humans. Here I discuss the mechanisms that contribute to neocortical organization in mammals, and how this organization has been altered to generate the variability that exists in different lineages.

AB  - Summary
The prefrontal cortex (PFC) receives substantial anatomical input from the amygdala, and these two structures have long been implicated in reward-related learning and decision making. Yet little is known about how these regions interact, especially in humans. We investigated the contribution of the amygdala to reward-related signals in PFC by scanning two rare subjects with focal bilateral amygdala lesions using fMRI. The subjects performed a reversal learning task in which they first had to learn which of two choices was the more rewarding, and then flexibly switch their choices when contingencies changed. Compared with healthy controls, both amygdala lesion subjects showed a profound change in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity associated with reward expectation and behavioral choice. These findings support a critical role for the human amygdala in establishing expected reward representations in PFC, which in turn may be used to guide behavioral choice.

AB  - Summary
Dopamine has been implicated in the modulation of diverse forms of behavioral plasticity, including appetitive learning and addiction. An important challenge is to understand how dopamine's effects at the cellular level alter the properties of neural circuits to modify behavior. In the nematode C. elegans, dopamine modulates habituation of an escape reflex triggered by body touch. In the absence of food, animals habituate more rapidly than in the presence of food; this contextual information about food availability is provided by dopaminergic mechanosensory neurons that sense the presence of bacteria. We find that dopamine alters habituation kinetics by selectively modulating the touch responses of the anterior-body mechanoreceptors; this modulation involves a D1-like dopamine receptor, a Gq/PLC-β signaling pathway, and calcium release within the touch neurons. Interestingly, the body touch mechanoreceptors can themselves excite the dopamine neurons, forming a positive feedback loop capable of integrating context and experience to modulate mechanosensory attention.

AB  - Summary
The resting brain is not silent, but exhibits organized fluctuations in neuronal activity even in the absence of tasks or stimuli. This intrinsic brain activity persists during task performance and contributes to variability in evoked brain responses. What is unknown is if this intrinsic activity also contributes to variability in behavior. In the current fMRI study, we identify a relationship between human brain activity in the left somatomotor cortex and spontaneous trial-to-trial variability in button press force. We then demonstrate that 74% of this brain-behavior relationship is attributable to ongoing fluctuations in intrinsic activity similar to those observed during resting fixation. In addition to establishing a functional and behavioral significance of intrinsic brain activity, these results lend new insight into the origins of variability in human behavior.

Brain atlases play an increasingly important role in neuroimaging, as they are invaluable for analysis, visualization, and comparison of results across studies. For both humans and macaque monkeys, digital brain atlases of many varieties are in widespread use, each having its own strengths and limitations. For studies of cerebral cortex there is particular utility in hybrid atlases that capitalize on the complementary nature of surface and volume representations, are based on a population average rather than an individual brain, and include measures of variation as well as averages. Linking different brain atlases to one another and to online databases containing a growing body of neuroimaging data will enable powerful forms of data mining that accelerate discovery and improve research efficiency.

AB  - Summary
We analyzed the influence of the transcription factor ΔFosB on learned helplessness, an animal model of affective disorder wherein a subset of mice exposed to inescapable stress (IS) develop a deficit in escape behavior. Repeated IS induces ΔFosB in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG), and levels of the protein are highly predictive of an individual's subsequent behavorial deficit—with the strongest ΔFosB induction observed in the most resilient animals. Induction of ΔFosB by IS predominates in substance P-positive neurons in the vlPAG, and the substance P gene, a direct target for ΔFosB, is downregulated upon ΔFosB induction. Local overexpression of ΔFosB in the vlPAG using viral-mediated gene transfer dramatically reduces depression-like behaviors and inhibits stress-induced release of substance P. These results indicate that IS-induced accumulation of ΔFosB in the vlPAG desensitizes substance P neurons enriched in this area and opposes behavioral despair by promoting active defense responses.

AB  - Summary
Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) convert electrical activity into calcium (Ca2+) signals that regulate cellular excitability, differentiation, and connectivity. The magnitude and kinetics of Ca2+ signals depend on the number of VGCCs at the plasma membrane, but little is known about the regulation of VGCC surface expression. We report that electrical activity causes internalization of the L-type Ca2+ channel (LTC) CaV1.2 and that this is mediated by binding to the tumor suppressor eIF3e/Int6 (eukaryotic initiation factor 3 subunit e). Using total internal reflection microscopy, we identify a population of CaV1.2 containing endosomes whose rapid trafficking is strongly regulated by Ca2+. We define a domain in the II-III loop of CaV1.2 that binds eIF3e and is essential for the activity dependence of both channel internalization and endosomal trafficking. These findings provide a mechanism for activity-dependent internalization and trafficking of CaV1.2 and provide a tantalizing link between Ca2+ homeostasis and a mammalian oncogene.

AB  - Summary
Neural network dysfunction may play an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neuronal circuits vulnerable to AD are also affected in human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) transgenic mice. hAPP mice with high levels of amyloid-β peptides in the brain develop AD-like abnormalities, including cognitive deficits and depletions of calcium-related proteins in the dentate gyrus, a region critically involved in learning and memory. Here, we report that hAPP mice have spontaneous nonconvulsive seizure activity in cortical and hippocampal networks, which is associated with GABAergic sprouting, enhanced synaptic inhibition, and synaptic plasticity deficits in the dentate gyrus. Many Aβ-induced neuronal alterations could be simulated in nontransgenic mice by excitotoxin challenge and prevented in hAPP mice by blocking overexcitation. Aberrant increases in network excitability and compensatory inhibitory mechanisms in the hippocampus may contribute to Aβ-induced neurological deficits in hAPP mice and, possibly, also in humans with AD.

Specific stimuli such as intracellular H+ and phosphoinositides (e.g., PIP2) gate inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels by controlling the reversible transition between the closed and open states. This gating mechanism underlies many aspects of Kir channel physiology and pathophysiology; however, its structural basis is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that H+ and PIP2 use a conserved gating mechanism defined by similar structural changes in the transmembrane (TM) helices and the selectivity filter. Our data support a model in which the gating motion of the TM helices is controlled by an intrasubunit hydrogen bond between TM1 and TM2 at the helix-bundle crossing, and we show that this defines a common gating motif in the Kir channel superfamily. Furthermore, we show that this proposed H-bonding interaction determines Kir channel pH sensitivity, pH and PIP2 gating kinetics, as well as a K+-dependent inactivation process at the selectivity filter and therefore many of the key regulatory mechanisms of Kir channel physiology.

AB  - Summary
To combine insights obtained from electric field potentials (LFPs) and neuronal spiking activity (MUA) we need a better understanding of the relative spatial summation of these indices of neuronal activity. Compared to MUA, the LFP has greater spatial coherence, resulting in lower spatial specificity and lower stimulus selectivity. A differential propagation of low- and high-frequency electric signals supposedly underlies this phenomenon, which could result from cortical tissue specifically attenuating higher frequencies, i.e., from a frequency-dependent impedance spectrum. Here we directly measure the cortical impedance spectrum in vivo in monkey primary visual cortex. Our results show that impedance is independent of frequency, is homogeneous and tangentially isotropic within gray matter, and can be theoretically predicted assuming a pure-resistive conductor. We propose that the spatial summation of LFP and MUA is determined by the size of these signals' generators and the nature of neural events underlying them, rather than by biophysical properties of gray matter.

AB  - Summary
Accumulation of specific proteins at synaptic structures is essential for synapse assembly and function, but mechanisms regulating local protein enrichment remain poorly understood. At the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), subsynaptic nuclei underlie motor axon terminals within extrafusal muscle fibers and are transcriptionally distinct from neighboring nuclei. In this study, we show that expression of the ETS transcription factor Erm is highly concentrated at subsynaptic nuclei, and its mutation in mice leads to severe downregulation of many genes with normally enriched subsynaptic expression. Erm mutant mice display an expansion of the muscle central domain in which acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clusters accumulate, show gradual fragmentation of AChR clusters, and exhibit symptoms of muscle weakness mimicking congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS). Together, our findings define Erm as an upstream regulator of a transcriptional program selective to subsynaptic nuclei at the NMJ and underscore the importance of transcriptional control of local synaptic protein accumulation.

AB  - Summary
We have characterized a rodent-specific gene family designated α-takusan (meaning “many” in Japanese). We initially identified a member of the family whose expression is upregulated in mice lacking the NMDAR subunit NR3A. We then isolated cDNAs encoding 46 α-takusan variants from mouse brains. Most variants share an ∼130 aa long sequence, which contains the previously identified domain of unknown function 622 (DUF622) and is predicted to form coiled-coil structures. Single-cell PCR analyses indicate that one neuron can express multiple α-takusan variants and particular variants may predominate in certain cell types. Forced expression in cultured hippocampal neurons of two variants, α1 or α2, which bind either directly or indirectly to PSD-95, leads to an increase in PSD-95 clustering, dendritic spine density, GluR1 surface expression, and AMPAR activity. Conversely, treating cultured neurons with RNAi targeting α-takusan variants resulted in the opposite phenotype. Hence, α-takusan represents a large gene family that regulates synaptic activity.

AB  - Clinical pain is a serious public health issue. Treatment of pain-related suffering requires knowledge of how pain signals are initially interpreted and subsequently transmitted and perpetuated. This review article is one of three reviews in this issue of Neuron that address our understanding of the pain process and possible solutions to the problem from both cellular- and systems-level viewpoints.

Our understanding of the neural correlates of pain perception in humans has increased significantly since the advent of neuroimaging. Relating neural activity changes to the varied pain experiences has led to an increased awareness of how factors (e.g., cognition, emotion, context, injury) can separately influence pain perception. Tying this body of knowledge in humans to work in animal models of pain provides an opportunity to determine common features that reliably contribute to pain perception and its modulation. One key system that underpins the ability to change pain intensity is the brainstem's descending modulatory network with its pro- and antinociceptive components. We discuss not only the latest data describing the cerebral signature of pain and its modulation in humans, but also suggest that the brainstem plays a pivotal role in gating the degree of nociceptive transmission so that the resultant pain experienced is appropriate for the particular situation of the individual.

This shift protects SN neurons in chemical models of Parkinson's disease (PD), suggesting that elevated intracellular Ca2+ participates in SN cell loss and that dihydropyridines may provide therapy in PD.

AB  - Summary
When faced with a crowded visual scene, observers must selectively attend to behaviorally relevant objects to avoid sensory overload. Often this selection process is guided by prior knowledge of a target-defining feature (e.g., the color red when looking for an apple), which enhances the firing rate of visual neurons that are selective for the attended feature. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a pattern classification algorithm to predict the attentional state of human observers as they monitored a visual feature (one of two directions of motion). We find that feature-specific attention effects spread across the visual field—even to regions of the scene that do not contain a stimulus. This spread of feature-based attention to empty regions of space may facilitate the perception of behaviorally relevant stimuli by increasing sensitivity to attended features at all locations in the visual field.

In this study, we characterize the adaptation of neurons in the cat lateral geniculate nucleus to changes in stimulus contrast and correlations. By comparing responses to high- and low-contrast natural scene movie and white noise stimuli, we show that an increase in contrast or correlations results in receptive fields with faster temporal dynamics and stronger antagonistic surrounds, as well as decreases in gain and selectivity. We also observe contrast- and correlation-induced changes in the reliability and sparseness of neural responses. We find that reliability is determined primarily by processing in the receptive field (the effective contrast of the stimulus), while sparseness is determined by the interactions between several functional properties. These results reveal a number of adaptive phenomena and suggest that adaptation to stimulus contrast and correlations may play an important role in visual coding in a dynamic natural environment.

AB  - Summary
Neurexins have been proposed to function as major mediators of the coordinated pre- and postsynaptic apposition. However, key evidence for this role in vivo has been lacking, particularly due to gene redundancy. Here, we have obtained null mutations in the single Drosophila neurexin gene (dnrx). dnrx loss of function prevents the normal proliferation of synaptic boutons at glutamatergic neuromuscular junctions, while dnrx gain of function in neurons has the opposite effect. DNRX mostly localizes to the active zone of presynaptic terminals. Conspicuously, dnrx null mutants display striking defects in synaptic ultrastructure, with the presence of detachments between pre- and postsynaptic membranes, abnormally long active zones, and increased number of T bars. These abnormalities result in corresponding alterations in synaptic transmission with reduced quantal content. Together, our results provide compelling evidence for an in vivo role of neurexins in the modulation of synaptic architecture and adhesive interactions between pre- and postsynaptic compartments.

Cerebellar basket cells inhibit postsynaptic Purkinje cells in a rapid and precise manner. To investigate the mechanisms of transmitter release underlying this rapid inhibition, Ca2+ uncaging was employed to measure the intracellular Ca2+ dependence of transmitter release and the kinetics of synaptic vesicle pool transitions in immature basket cell synapses at room temperature. Vesicle release properties distinct from those previously observed at excitatory synapses were seen, including a relatively high intracellular Ca2+ sensitivity of vesicle fusion, rapid vesicle pool mobilization with few reluctant vesicles, and vesicle replenishment driven by unusually high Ca2+ levels from both local and residual Ca2+ sources during action potential trains. These results suggest that inhibitory basket cell synapses are optimized for rapid and precise temporal and spatial Ca2+ coordination of synaptic vesicle fusion and replenishment, which may contribute to the unique physiology of inhibitory synaptic transmission, including phasic release during action potential trains and tonic release by residual intracellular Ca2+.

AB  - Summary
The lateral division of the central amygdala (CeAL) is the target of ascending fibers from the pain-responsive and stress-responsive nuclei in the brainstem. We show that single fiber inputs from the nociceptive pontine parabrachial nucleus onto CeAL neurons form suprathreshold glutamatergic synapses with multiple release sites. Noradrenaline, acting at presynaptic α2 receptors, potently inhibits this synapse. This inhibition results from a decrease in the number of active release sites with no change in release probability. Introduction of a presynaptic scavenger of Gβγ subunits blocked the effects of noradrenaline, and botulinum toxin A reduced its effects, showing a direct action of βγ subunits on the release machinery. These data illustrate a mechanism of presynaptic modulation where the output of a large multiple-release-site synapse is potently regulated by endogenously released noradrenaline and suggests that the CeA may be a target for the central nociceptive actions of noradrenaline.

AB  - Summary
Is there a neural representation of speech that transcends its sensory properties? Using fMRI, we investigated whether there are brain areas where neural activity during observation of sublexical audiovisual input corresponds to a listener's speech percept (what is “heard”) independent of the sensory properties of the input. A target audiovisual stimulus was preceded by stimuli that (1) shared the target's auditory features (auditory overlap), (2) shared the target's visual features (visual overlap), or (3) shared neither the target's auditory or visual features but were perceived as the target (perceptual overlap). In two left-hemisphere regions (pars opercularis, planum polare), the target invoked less activity when it was preceded by the perceptually overlapping stimulus than when preceded by stimuli that shared one of its sensory components. This pattern of neural facilitation indicates that these regions code sublexical speech at an abstract level corresponding to that of the speech percept.

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of heritable mental retardation and the leading identified cause of autism. FXS is caused by transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene that encodes the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), but the pathogenesis of the disease is unknown. According to one proposal, many psychiatric and neurological symptoms of FXS result from unchecked activation of mGluR5, a metabotropic glutamate receptor. To test this idea we generated Fmr1 mutant mice with a 50% reduction in mGluR5 expression and studied a range of phenotypes with relevance to the human disorder. Our results demonstrate that mGluR5 contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of the disease, a finding that has significant therapeutic implications for fragile X and related developmental disorders.

AB  - Summary
Neurexins and neuroligins provide trans-synaptic connectivity by the Ca2+-dependent interaction of their alternatively spliced extracellular domains. Neuroligins specify synapses in an activity-dependent manner, presumably by binding to neurexins. Here, we present the crystal structures of neuroligin-1 in isolation and in complex with neurexin-1β. Neuroligin-1 forms a constitutive dimer, and two neurexin-1β monomers bind to two identical surfaces on the opposite faces of the neuroligin-1 dimer to form a heterotetramer. The neuroligin-1/neurexin-1β complex exhibits a nanomolar affinity and includes a large binding interface that contains bound Ca2+. Alternatively spliced sites in neurexin-1β and in neuroligin-1 are positioned nearby the binding interface, explaining how they regulate the interaction. Structure-based mutations of neuroligin-1 at the interface disrupt binding to neurexin-1β, but not the folding of neuroligin-1 and confirm the validity of the binding interface of the neuroligin-1/neurexin-1β complex. Our results provide molecular insights for understanding the role of cell-adhesion proteins in synapse function.

AB  - Summary
HCN1 hyperpolarization-activated cation channels act as an inhibitory constraint of both spatial learning and synaptic integration and long-term plasticity in the distal dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. However, as HCN1 channels provide an excitatory current, the mechanism of their inhibitory action remains unclear. Here we report that HCN1 channels also constrain CA1 distal dendritic Ca2+ spikes, which have been implicated in the induction of LTP at distal excitatory synapses. Our experimental and computational results indicate that HCN1 channels provide both an active shunt conductance that decreases the temporal integration of distal EPSPs and a tonic depolarizing current that increases resting inactivation of T-type and N-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, which contribute to the Ca2+ spikes. This dual mechanism may provide a general means by which HCN channels regulate dendritic excitability.

AB  - The Drosophila Dscams are immunoglobulin superfamily members produced from a single gene that is diversified by alternative splicing to produce a family of cell-surface proteins with over 19,000 different ectodomain isoforms. Dscams are critical for neuronal wiring, and mounting evidence suggests that they play a key role in self-avoidance between sister branches from neurons, which depends on homophilic self-recognition by Dscams. Two recent papers shed new light on Dscam recognition: first by showing that the vast majority of Dscam isoforms mediate specific homophilic binding and second by revealing the essence of the molecular basis of homophilic recognition by Dscams through high-resolution structural studies.

AB  - Summary
Binocular rivalry has been extensively studied to understand the mechanisms that control switches in visual awareness and much has been revealed about the contributions of stimulus and cognitive factors. Because visual processes are fundamentally adaptive, however, it is also important to understand how experience alters the dynamics of perceptual switches. When observers viewed binocular rivalry repeatedly over many days, the rate of perceptual switches increased as much as 3-fold. This long-term rivalry speeding exhibited a pattern of image-feature specificity that ruled out primary contributions from strategic and nonsensory factors and implicated neural plasticity occurring in both low- and high-level visual processes in the ventral stream. Furthermore, the speeding occurred only when the rivaling patterns were voluntarily attended, suggesting that the underlying neural plasticity selectively engages when stimuli are behaviorally relevant. Long-term rivalry speeding may thus reflect broader mechanisms that facilitate quick assessments of signals that contain multiple behaviorally relevant interpretations.

AB  - Summary
While the motor and attentional roles of the frontal eye field (FEF) are well documented, the relationship between them is unknown. We exploited the known influence of visual motion on the apparent positions of targets, and measured how this illusion affects saccadic eye movements during FEF microstimulation. Without microstimulation, saccades to a moving grating are biased in the direction of motion, consistent with the apparent position illusion. Here we show that microstimulation of spatially aligned FEF representations increases the influence of this illusion on saccades. Rather than simply impose a fixed-vector signal, subthreshold stimulation directed saccades away from the FEF movement field, and instead more strongly in the direction of visual motion. These results demonstrate that the attentional effects of FEF stimulation govern visually guided saccades, and suggest that the two roles of the FEF work together to select both the features of a target and the appropriate movement to foveate it.

AB  - The postnatal neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome (RTT) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a transcriptional repressor involved in chromatin remodeling and the modulation of RNA splicing. MECP2 aberrations result in a constellation of neuropsychiatric abnormalities, whereby both loss of function and gain in MECP2 dosage lead to similar neurological phenotypes. Recent studies demonstrate disease reversibility in RTT mouse models, suggesting that the neurological defects in MECP2 disorders are not permanent. To investigate the potential for restoring neuronal function in RTT patients, it is essential to identify MeCP2 targets or modifiers of the phenotype that can be therapeutically modulated. Moreover, deciphering the molecular underpinnings of RTT is likely to contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of a broader class of neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Visual system circuitry, a canonical model system for the study of experience-dependent development, matures before and following the onset of vision. Sensory experience or deprivation during an early critical period results in substantial plasticity and is a crucial factor in establishing the mature circuitry. In adulthood, plasticity has been thought to be reduced or absent. However, recent studies point to the potential for change in neuronal circuits within the mature brain, raising the possibility that aberrant circuit function can be corrected. In this review, we will discuss recent exciting findings in the field of experience-dependent plasticity that advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying the activation, expression, and closure of critical periods in the visual system.

AB  - Summary
Activity-dependent rapid structural and functional modifications of central excitatory synapses contribute to synapse maturation, experience-dependent plasticity, and learning and memory and are associated with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. However, the signal transduction mechanisms that link glutamate receptor activation to intracellular effectors that accomplish structural and functional plasticity are not well understood. Here we report that NMDA receptor activation in pyramidal neurons causes CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) kalirin-7 at residue threonine 95, regulating its GEF activity, leading to activation of small GTPase Rac1 and rapid enlargement of existing spines. Kalirin-7 also interacts with AMPA receptors and controls their synaptic expression. By demonstrating that kalirin expression and spine localization are required for activity-dependent spine enlargement and enhancement of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission, our study identifies a signaling pathway that controls structural and functional spine plasticity.

AB  - Summary
All known human societies establish social order by punishing violators of social norms. However, little is known about how the brain processes the punishment threat associated with norm violations. We use fMRI to study the neural circuitry behind social norm compliance by comparing a treatment in which norm violations can be punished with a control treatment in which punishment is impossible. Individuals' increase in norm compliance when punishment is possible exhibits a strong positive correlation with activations in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Moreover, lateral orbitofrontal cortex activity is strongly correlated with Machiavellian personality characteristics. These findings indicate a neural network involved in social norm compliance that might constitute an important basis for human sociality. Different activations of this network reveal individual differences in the behavioral response to the punishment threat and might thus provide a deeper understanding of the neurobiological sources of pathologies such as antisocial personality disorder.

AB  - The tactile somatosensory pathway from whisker to cortex in rodents provides a well-defined system for exploring the link between molecular mechanisms, synaptic circuits, and behavior. The primary somatosensory cortex has an exquisite somatotopic map where each individual whisker is represented in a discrete anatomical unit, the “barrel,” allowing precise delineation of functional organization, development, and plasticity. Sensory information is actively acquired in awake behaving rodents and processed differently within the barrel map depending upon whisker-related behavior. The prominence of state-dependent cortical sensory processing is likely to be crucial in our understanding of active sensory perception, experience-dependent plasticity and learning.

NF-κB signaling has been implicated in neurodegenerative disease, epilepsy, and neuronal plasticity. However, the cellular and molecular activity of NF-κB signaling within the nervous system remains to be clearly defined. Here, we show that the NF-κB and IκB homologs Dorsal and Cactus surround postsynaptic glutamate receptor (GluR) clusters at the Drosophila NMJ. We then show that mutations in dorsal, cactus, and IRAK/pelle kinase specifically impair GluR levels, assayed immunohistochemically and electrophysiologically, without affecting NMJ growth, the size of the postsynaptic density, or homeostatic plasticity. Additional genetic experiments support the conclusion that cactus functions in concert with, rather than in opposition to, dorsal and pelle in this process. Finally, we provide evidence that Dorsal and Cactus act posttranscriptionally, outside the nucleus, to control GluR density. Based upon our data we speculate that Dorsal, Cactus, and Pelle could function together, locally at the postsynaptic density, to specify GluR levels.

AB  - Summary
Inhibition of postsynaptic glutamate receptors at the Drosophila NMJ initiates a compensatory increase in presynaptic release termed synaptic homeostasis. BMP signaling is necessary for normal synaptic growth and stability. It remains unknown whether BMPs have a specific role during synaptic homeostasis and, if so, whether BMP signaling functions as an instructive retrograde signal that directly modulates presynaptic transmitter release. Here, we demonstrate that the BMP receptor (Wit) and ligand (Gbb) are necessary for the rapid induction of synaptic homeostasis. We also provide evidence that both Wit and Gbb have functions during synaptic homeostasis that are separable from NMJ growth. However, further genetic experiments demonstrate that Gbb does not function as an instructive retrograde signal during synaptic homeostasis. Rather, our data indicate that Wit and Gbb function via the downstream transcription factor Mad and that Mad-mediated signaling is continuously required during development to confer competence of motoneurons to express synaptic homeostasis.

Current antidepressants are clinically effective only after several weeks of administration. Here, we show that serotonin4 (5-HT4) agonists reduce immobility in the forced swimming test, displaying an antidepressant potential. Moreover, a 3 day regimen with such compounds modifies rat brain parameters considered to be key markers of antidepressant action, but that are observed only after 2–3 week treatments with classical molecules: desensitization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors, increased tonus on hippocampal postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, and enhanced phosphorylation of the CREB protein and neurogenesis in the hippocampus. In contrast, a 3 day treatment with the SSRI citalopram remains devoid of any effect on these parameters. Finally, a 3 day regimen with the 5-HT4 agonist RS 67333 was sufficient to reduce both the hyperlocomotion induced by olfactory bulbectomy and the diminution of sucrose intake consecutive to a chronic mild stress. These findings point out 5-HT4 receptor agonists as a putative class of antidepressants with a rapid onset of action.

AB  - Exposure to traumatic stress is a requirement for the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, because the majority of trauma-exposed persons do not develop PTSD, examination of the typical effects of a stressor will not identify the critical components of PTSD risk or pathogenesis. Rather, PTSD represents a specific phenotype associated with a failure to recover from the normal effects of trauma. Thus, research must focus on identifying pre- and posttraumatic risk factors that explain the development of the disorder and the failure to reinstate physiological homeostasis. In this review, we summarize what is known about the clinical and biological characteristics of PTSD and articulate some of the gaps in knowledge that can be addressed by basic neuroscience research. We emphasize how knowledge about individual differences related to genetic and epigenetic factors in behavioral and brain responses to stress offers the hope of a deeper understanding of PTSD.

AB  - Summary
Our visual system imposes structure onto images that usually contain a diversity of surfaces, contours, and colors. Psychological theories propose that there are multiple steps in this process that occur in hierarchically organized regions of the cortex: early visual areas register basic features, higher areas bind them into objects, and yet higher areas select the objects that are relevant for behavior. Here we test these theories by recording from the primary visual cortex (area V1) of monkeys. We demonstrate that the V1 neurons first register the features (at a latency of 48 ms), then segregate figures from the background (after 57 ms), and finally select relevant figures over irrelevant ones (after 137 ms). We conclude that the psychological processing stages map onto distinct time episodes that unfold in the visual cortex after the presentation of a new stimulus, so that area V1 may contribute to all these processing steps.

AB  - Summary
Synaptic activity induces changes in the number of dendritic spines. Here, we report a pathway of regulated endocytosis triggered by arcadlin, a protocadherin induced by electroconvulsive and other excitatory stimuli in hippocampal neurons. The homophilic binding of extracellular arcadlin domains activates TAO2β, a splice variant of the thousand and one amino acid protein kinase 2, cloned here by virtue of its binding to the arcadlin intracellular domain. TAO2β is a MAPKKK that activates the MEK3 MAPKK, which phosphorylates the p38 MAPK. Activation of p38 feeds-back on TAO2β, phosphorylating a key serine required for triggering endocytosis of N-cadherin at the synapse. Arcadlin knockout increases the number of dendritic spines, and the phenotype is rescued by siRNA knockdown of N-cadherin. This pathway of regulated endocytosis of N-cadherin via protocadherin/TAO2β/MEK3/p38 provides a molecular mechanism for transducing neuronal activity into changes in synaptic morphologies.

AB  - Summary
Primary visual cortex recombines inputs from magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) streams to create functionally specialized outputs. Understanding these input-output relationships is complicated by the fact that layer 4B, which provides outputs to dorsal visual areas, contains multiple cell types. Using a modified rabies virus that expresses green fluorescent protein, we show that layer 4B neurons projecting to MT are a majority spiny stellate, whereas those projecting to V2 are overwhelmingly pyramidal. Regardless of cell type, MT-projecting neurons have larger cell bodies, more dendritic length, and are deeper within layer 4B. Furthermore, MT-projecting pyramidal neurons are located preferentially underneath cytochrome oxidase blobs, indicating that MT-projecting neurons of both types restrict their dendrites to M-recipient zones. We conclude that MT-projecting layer 4B neurons are specialized for the fast transmission of information from the M pathway, while V2-projecting neurons are likely to mediate slower computations involving mixed M and P signals.

AB  - Summary
Neuronal network formation in the developing nervous system is dependent on the accurate navigation of nerve cell axons and dendrites, which is controlled by attractive and repulsive guidance cues. Ephrins and their cognate Eph receptors mediate many repulsive axonal guidance decisions by intercellular interactions resulting in growth cone collapse and axon retraction of the Eph-presenting neuron. We show that the Rac-specific GTPase-activating protein α2-chimaerin binds activated EphA4 and mediates EphA4-triggered axonal growth cone collapse. α-Chimaerin mutant mice display a phenotype similar to that of EphA4 mutant mice, including aberrant midline axon guidance and defective spinal cord central pattern generator activity. Our results reveal an α-chimaerin-dependent signaling pathway downstream of EphA4, which is essential for axon guidance decisions and neuronal circuit formation in vivo.

AB  - Summary
Previously formed memories are susceptible to disruption immediately after recall due to a necessity to be reconsolidated after retrieval. Protein translation mechanisms have been widely implicated as being necessary for memory reconsolidation, but gene transcription mechanisms have been much less extensively studied in this context. We found that retrieval of contextual conditioned fear memories activates the NF-κB pathway to regulate histone H3 phosphorylation and acetylation at specific gene promoters in hippocampus, specifically via IKKα and not the NF-κB DNA-binding complex. Behaviorally, we found that inhibition of IKKα regulation of either chromatin structure or NF-κB DNA-binding complex activity leads to impairments in fear memory reconsolidation, and that elevating histone acetylation rescues this memory deficit in the face of IKK blockade. These data provide insights into IKK-regulated transcriptional mechanisms in hippocampus that are necessary for memory reconsolidation.

AB  - Summary
We report a technique for two-photon fluorescence imaging with cellular resolution in awake, behaving mice with minimal motion artifact. The apparatus combines an upright, table-mounted two-photon microscope with a spherical treadmill consisting of a large, air-supported Styrofoam ball. Mice, with implanted cranial windows, are head restrained under the objective while their limbs rest on the ball's upper surface. Following adaptation to head restraint, mice maneuver on the spherical treadmill as their heads remain motionless. Image sequences demonstrate that running-associated brain motion is limited to ∼2-5 μm. In addition, motion is predominantly in the focal plane, with little out-of-plane motion, making the application of a custom-designed Hidden-Markov-Model-based motion correction algorithm useful for postprocessing. Behaviorally correlated calcium transients from large neuronal and astrocytic populations were routinely measured, with an estimated motion-induced false positive error rate of &lt;5%.

AB  - Summary
Animals and humans learn to approach and acquire pleasant stimuli and to avoid or defend against aversive ones. However, both pleasant and aversive stimuli can elicit arousal and attention, and their salience or intensity increases when they occur by surprise. Thus, adaptive behavior may require that neural circuits compute both stimulus valence—or value—and intensity. To explore how these computations may be implemented, we examined neural responses in the primate amygdala to unexpected reinforcement during learning. Many amygdala neurons responded differently to reinforcement depending upon whether or not it was expected. In some neurons, this modulation occurred only for rewards or aversive stimuli, but not both. In other neurons, expectation similarly modulated responses to both rewards and punishments. These different neuronal populations may subserve two sorts of processes mediated by the amygdala: those activated by surprising reinforcements of both valences—such as enhanced arousal and attention—and those that are valence-specific, such as fear or reward-seeking behavior.

AB  - Summary
Near coincidental pre- and postsynaptic action potentials induce associative long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD), depending on the order of their timing. Here, we show that in visual cortex the rules of this spike-timing-dependent plasticity are not rigid, but shaped by neuromodulator receptors coupled to adenylyl cyclase (AC) and phospholipase C (PLC) signaling cascades. Activation of the AC and PLC cascades results in phosphorylation of postsynaptic glutamate receptors at sites that serve as specific “tags” for LTP and LTD. As a consequence, the outcome (i.e., whether LTP or LTD) of a given pattern of pre- and postsynaptic firing depends not only on the order of the timing, but also on the relative activation of neuromodulator receptors coupled to AC and PLC. These findings indicate that cholinergic and adrenergic neuromodulation associated with the behavioral state of the animal can control the gating and the polarity of cortical plasticity.

AB  - Summary
We show that when a moving object suddenly reverses direction, there is a brief, synchronous burst of firing within a population of retinal ganglion cells. This burst can be driven by either the leading or trailing edge of the object. The latency is constant for movement at different speeds, objects of different size, and bright versus dark contrasts. The same ganglion cells that signal a motion reversal also respond to smooth motion. We show that the brain can build a pure reversal detector using only a linear filter that reads out synchrony from a group of ganglion cells. These results indicate that not only can the retina anticipate the location of a smoothly moving object, but that it can also signal violations in its own prediction. We show that the reversal response cannot be explained by models of the classical receptive field and suggest that nonlinear receptive field subunits may be responsible.

AB  - Summary
The diversity of dendritic patterns is one of the fundamental characteristics of neurons and is in part regulated by transcriptional programs initiated by electrical activity. We show that dendritic outgrowth requires a family of combinatorially assembled, neuron-specific chromatin remodeling complexes (nBAF complexes) distinguished by the actin-related protein BAF53b and based on the Brg/Brm ATPases. nBAF complexes bind tightly to the Ca2+-responsive dendritic regulator CREST and directly regulate genes essential for dendritic outgrowth. BAF53b is not required for nBAF complex assembly or the interaction with CREST, yet is required for their recruitment to the promoters of specific target genes. The highly homologous BAF53a protein, which is a component of neural progenitor and nonneural BAF complexes, cannot replace BAF53b's role in dendritic development. Remarkably, we find that this functional specificity is conferred by the actin fold subdomain 2 of BAF53b. These studies suggest that the genes encoding the individual subunits of BAF complexes function like letters in a ten-letter word to produce biologically specific meanings (in this case dendritic outgrowth) by combinatorial assembly of their products.

AB  - Summary
A family of transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs) profoundly affects the trafficking and gating of AMPA receptors (AMPARs). Although TARP subtypes are differentially expressed throughout the CNS, it is unclear whether this imparts functional diversity to AMPARs in distinct neuronal populations. Here, we examine the effects of each TARP subtype on the kinetics of AMPAR gating in heterologous cells and in neurons. We report a striking heterogeneity in the effects of TARP subtypes on AMPAR deactivation and desensitization, which we demonstrate controls the time course of synaptic transmission. In addition, we find that some TARP subtypes dramatically slow AMPAR activation kinetics. Synaptic AMPAR kinetics also depend on TARP expression level, suggesting a variable TARP/AMPAR stoichiometry. Analysis of quantal synaptic transmission in a TARP γ-4 knockout (KO) mouse corroborates our expression data and demonstrates that TARP subtype-specific gating of AMPARs contributes to the kinetics of native AMPARs at central synapses.

AB  - Direction selectivity represents a fundamental computation found across multiple sensory systems. In the mammalian visual system, direction selectivity appears first in the retina, where excitatory and inhibitory interneurons release neurotransmitter most rapidly during movement in a preferred direction. Two parallel sets of interneuron signals are integrated by a direction-selective ganglion cell, which creates a direction preference for both bright and dark moving objects. Direction selectivity of synaptic input becomes amplified by action potentials in the ganglion cell dendrites. Recent work has elucidated direction-selective mechanisms in inhibitory circuitry, but mechanisms in excitatory circuitry remain unexplained.

AB  - Summary
The intraparietal cortex is involved in the control of visually guided actions, like reach-to-grasp movements, which require extracting the 3D shape and position of objects from 2D retinal images. Using fMRI in behaving monkeys, we investigated the role of the intraparietal cortex in processing stereoscopic information for recovering the depth structure and the position in depth of objects. We found that while several areas (CIP, LIP, and AIP on the lateral bank; PIP and MIP on the medial bank) are activated by stereoscopic stimuli, AIP and an adjoining portion of LIP are sensitive only to depth structure. Furthermore, only these two regions are sensitive to both the depth structure and the 2D shape of small objects. These results indicate that extracting 3D spatial information from stereo involves several intraparietal areas, among which AIP and anterior LIP are more specifically engaged in extracting the 3D shape of objects.

AB  - Summary
The assembly of neuronal networks during development requires tightly controlled cell-cell interactions. Multiple cell surface receptors that control axon guidance and synapse maturation have been identified. However, the signaling mechanisms downstream of these receptors have remained unclear. Receptor signals might be transmitted through dedicated signaling lines defined by specific effector proteins. Alternatively, a single cell surface receptor might couple to multiple effectors with overlapping functions. We identified the neuronal RacGAP α2-chimaerin as an effector for the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA4. α2-Chimaerin interacts with activated EphA4 and is required for ephrin-induced growth cone collapse in cortical neurons. α2-Chimaerin mutant mice exhibit a rabbit-like hopping gait with synchronous hindlimb movements that phenocopies mice lacking EphA4 kinase activity. Anatomical and functional analyses of corticospinal and spinal interneuron projections reveal that loss of α2-chimaerin results in impairment of EphA4 signaling in vivo. These findings identify α2-chimaerin as an indispensable effector for EphA4 in cortical and spinal motor circuits.

AB  - The function of inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) channels is highly diverse and therefore is tightly regulated by various environmental factors. In their article in this issue of Neuron, Rapedius et al. recognize a conserved structural mechanism for Kir channels gating by both pH and PIP2. In light of these findings and accumulated knowledge, PIP2 is suggested to have a common coregulatory role in the gating of Kir channels by all their soluble modulators.

AB  - Summary
To allow perception of a continuous world, cortical mechanisms extrapolate missing information with highly constrained predictions about the environment just beyond the edges of a view. Here, we report functional magnetic resonance imaging evidence for extrapolation of scene layout information beyond what was physically presented, an illusion known as boundary extension. Consistent with behavioral reports, we observed boundary extension for scene-selective attenuation in the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC), but no such extrapolation of object representations in the lateral occipital complex (LOC). These results demonstrate that scene layout representations are extrapolated beyond the confines of the perceptual input. Such extrapolation may facilitate perception of a continuous world from discontinuous views.

AB  - Summary
Neural processing at most stages of the primate visual system is modulated by selective attention, such that behaviorally relevant information is emphasized at the expenses of irrelevant, potentially distracting information. The form of attention best understood at the cellular level is when stimuli at a given location in the visual field must be selected (space-based attention). In contrast, fewer single-unit recording studies have so far explored the cellular mechanisms of attention operating on individual stimulus features, specifically when one feature (e.g., color) of an object must guide behavioral responses while a second feature (e.g., shape) of the same object is potentially interfering and therefore must be ignored. Here we show that activity of neurons in macaque area V4 can underlie the selection of elemental object features and their “translation” into a categorical format that can directly contribute to the control of the animal's behavior.

AB  - Summary
Experience-dependent plasticity is crucial for the precise formation of neuronal connections during development. It is generally thought to depend on Hebbian forms of synaptic plasticity. In addition, neurons possess other, homeostatic means of compensating for changes in sensory input, but their role in cortical plasticity is unclear. We used two-photon calcium imaging to investigate whether homeostatic response regulation contributes to changes of eye-specific responsiveness after monocular deprivation (MD) in mouse visual cortex. Short MD durations decreased deprived-eye responses in neurons with binocular input. Longer MD periods strengthened open-eye responses, and surprisingly, also increased deprived-eye responses in neurons devoid of open-eye input. These bidirectional response adjustments effectively preserved the net visual drive for each neuron. Our finding that deprived-eye responses were either weaker or stronger after MD, depending on the amount of open-eye input a cell received, argues for both Hebbian and homeostatic mechanisms regulating neuronal responsiveness during experience-dependent plasticity.

AB  - Summary
The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ4 allele is the best established genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). We conducted genome-wide surveys of 502,627 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to characterize and confirm other LOAD susceptibility genes. In ɛ4 carriers from neuropathologically verified discovery, neuropathologically verified replication, and clinically characterized replication cohorts of 1411 cases and controls, LOAD was associated with six SNPs from the GRB-associated binding protein 2 (GAB2) gene and a common haplotype encompassing the entire GAB2 gene. SNP rs2373115 (p = 9 × 10−11) was associated with an odds ratio of 4.06 (confidence interval 2.81–14.69), which interacts with APOE ɛ4 to further modify risk. GAB2 was overexpressed in pathologically vulnerable neurons; the Gab2 protein was detected in neurons, tangle-bearing neurons, and dystrophic neuritis; and interference with GAB2 gene expression increased tau phosphorylation. Our findings suggest that GAB2 modifies LOAD risk in APOE ɛ4 carriers and influences Alzheimer's neuropathology.

AB  - Summary
TRPV1 plays a key role in nociception, as it is activated by heat, low pH, and ligands such as capsaicin, leading to a burning pain sensation. We describe the structure of the cytosolic ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) of TRPV1 and identify a multiligand-binding site important in regulating channel sensitivity within the TRPV1-ARD. The structure reveals a binding site that accommodates triphosphate nucleotides such as ATP, and biochemical studies demonstrate that calmodulin binds the same site. Electrophysiology experiments show that either ATP or PIP2 prevent desensitization to repeated applications of capsaicin, i.e., tachyphylaxis, while calmodulin plays an opposing role and is necessary for tachyphylaxis. Mutations in the TRPV1-ARD binding site eliminate tachyphylaxis. We present a model for the calcium-dependent regulation of TRPV1 via competitive interactions of ATP and calmodulin at the TRPV1-ARD-binding site and discuss its relationship to the C-terminal region previously implicated in interactions with PIP2 and calmodulin.

AB  - Summary
Astrocytes are considered the third component of the synapse, responding to neurotransmitter release from synaptic terminals and releasing gliotransmitters—including glutamate—in a Ca2+-dependent manner to affect neuronal synaptic activity. Many studies reporting astrocyte-driven neuronal activity have evoked astrocyte Ca2+ increases by application of endogenous ligands that directly activate neuronal receptors, making astrocyte contribution to neuronal effect(s) difficult to determine. We have made transgenic mice that express a Gq-coupled receptor only in astrocytes to evoke astrocyte Ca2+ increases using an agonist that does not bind endogenous receptors in brain. By recording from CA1 pyramidal cells in acute hippocampal slices from these mice, we demonstrate that widespread Ca2+ elevations in 80%–90% of stratum radiatum astrocytes do not increase neuronal Ca2+, produce neuronal slow inward currents, or affect excitatory synaptic activity. Our findings call into question the developing consensus that Ca2+-dependent glutamate release by astrocytes directly affects neuronal synaptic activity in situ.

AB  - Summary
Active adult neurogenesis occurs in discrete brain regions of all mammals and is widely regarded as a neuronal replacement mechanism. Whether adult-born neurons make unique contributions to brain functions is largely unknown. Here we systematically characterized synaptic plasticity of retrovirally labeled adult-born dentate granule cells at different stages during their neuronal maturation. We identified a critical period between 1 and 1.5 months of the cell age when adult-born neurons exhibit enhanced long-term potentiation with increased potentiation amplitude and decreased induction threshold. Furthermore, such enhanced plasticity in adult-born neurons depends on developmentally regulated synaptic expression of NR2B-containing NMDA receptors. Our study demonstrates that adult-born neurons exhibit the same classic critical period plasticity as neurons in the developing nervous system. The transient nature of such enhanced plasticity may provide a fundamental mechanism allowing adult-born neurons within the critical period to serve as major mediators of experience-induced plasticity while maintaining stability of the mature circuitry.

AB  - Summary
Light is the most potent stimulus for synchronizing endogenous circadian rhythms with external time. Photic clock resetting in mammals involves cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB)-mediated transcriptional activation of Period clock genes in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). Here we provide evidence for an additional photic input pathway to the mammalian circadian clock based on Protein Kinase C α (PRKCA). We found that Prkca-deficient mice show an impairment of light-mediated clock resetting. In the SCN of wild-type mice, light exposure evokes a transient interaction between PRKCA and PERIOD 2 (PER2) proteins that affects PER2 stability and nucleocytoplasmic distribution. These posttranslational events, together with CREB-mediated transcriptional regulation, are key factors in the molecular mechanism of photic clock resetting.

AB  - Summary
Diacylglycerol (DAG) is a prominent endogenous modulator of synaptic transmission. Recent studies proposed two apparently incompatible pathways, via protein kinase C (PKC) and via Munc13. Here we show how these two pathways converge. First, we confirm that DAG analogs indeed continue to potentiate transmission after PKC inhibition (the Munc13 pathway), but only in neurons that previously experienced DAG analogs, before PKC inhibition started. Second, we identify an essential PKC pathway by expressing a PKC-insensitive Munc18-1 mutant in munc18-1 null mutant neurons. This mutant supported basic transmission, but not DAG-induced potentiation and vesicle redistribution. Moreover, synaptic depression was increased, but not Ca2+-independent release evoked by hypertonic solutions. These data show that activation of both PKC-dependent and -independent pathways (via Munc13) are required for DAG-induced potentiation. Munc18-1 is an essential downstream target in the PKC pathway. This pathway is of general importance for presynaptic plasticity.

AB  - Summary
Via its extracellular N-terminal domain (NTD), the AMPA receptor subunit GluR2 promotes the formation and growth of dendritic spines in cultured hippocampal neurons. Here we show that the first N-terminal 92 amino acids of the extracellular domain are necessary and sufficient for GluR2′s spine-promoting activity. Moreover, overexpression of this extracellular domain increases the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). Biochemically, the NTD of GluR2 can interact directly with the cell adhesion molecule N-cadherin, in cis or in trans. N-cadherin-coated beads recruit GluR2 on the surface of hippocampal neurons, and N-cadherin immobilization decreases GluR2 lateral diffusion on the neuronal surface. RNAi knockdown of N-cadherin prevents the enhancing effect of GluR2 on spine morphogenesis and mEPSC frequency. Our data indicate that in hippocampal neurons N-cadherin and GluR2 form a synaptic complex that stimulates presynaptic development and function as well as promoting dendritic spine formation.

AB  - Summary
When interfering objects occlude a scene, the visual system restores the occluded information. Similarly, when a sound of interest (a “foreground” sound) is interrupted (occluded) by loud noise, the auditory system restores the occluded information. This process, called auditory induction, can be exploited to create a continuity illusion. When a segment of a foreground sound is deleted and loud noise fills the missing portion, listeners incorrectly report hearing the foreground continuing through the noise. Here we reveal the neurophysiological underpinnings of illusory continuity in single-neuron responses from awake macaque monkeys' primary auditory cortex (A1). A1 neurons represented the missing segment of occluded tonal foregrounds by responding to discontinuous foregrounds interrupted by intense noise as if they were responding to the complete foregrounds. By comparison, simulated peripheral responses represented only the noise and not the occluded foreground. The results reveal that many A1 single-neuron responses closely follow the illusory percept.

AB  - Summary
Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is a light-gated, cation-selective ion channel isolated from the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Here, we report the generation of transgenic mice that express a ChR2-YFP fusion protein in the CNS for in vivo activation and mapping of neural circuits. Using focal illumination of the cerebral cortex and olfactory bulb, we demonstrate a highly reproducible, light-dependent activation of neurons and precise control of firing frequency in vivo. To test the feasibility of mapping neural circuits, we exploited the circuitry formed between the olfactory bulb and the piriform cortex in anesthetized mice. In the olfactory bulb, individual mitral cells fired action potentials in response to light, and their firing rate was not influenced by costimulated glomeruli. However, in piriform cortex, the activity of target neurons increased as larger areas of the bulb were illuminated to recruit additional glomeruli. These results support a model of olfactory processing that is dependent upon mitral cell convergence and integration onto cortical cells. More broadly, these findings demonstrate a system for precise manipulation of neural activity in the intact mammalian brain with light and illustrate the use of ChR2 mice in exploring functional connectivity of complex neural circuits in vivo.

AB  - All cortical and thalamic levels of sensory processing are subject to powerful top-down influences, the shaping of lower-level processes by more complex information. New findings on the diversity of top-down interactions show that cortical areas function as adaptive processors, being subject to attention, expectation, and perceptual task. Brain states are determined by the interactions between multiple cortical areas and the modulation of intrinsic circuits by feedback connections. In perceptual learning, both the encoding and recall of learned information involves a selection of the appropriate inputs that convey information about the stimulus being discriminated. Disruption of this interaction may lead to behavioral disorders, including schizophrenia.

AB  - Summary
Endocannabinoids (eCBs) have emerged as key activity-dependent signals that, by activating presynaptic cannabinoid receptors (i.e., CB1) coupled to Gi/o protein, can mediate short-term and long-term synaptic depression (LTD). While the presynaptic mechanisms underlying eCB-dependent short-term depression have been identified, the molecular events linking CB1 receptors to LTD are unknown. Here we show in the hippocampus that long-term, but not short-term, eCB-dependent depression of inhibitory transmission requires presynaptic cAMP/PKA signaling. We further identify the active zone protein RIM1α as a key mediator of both CB1 receptor effects on the release machinery and eCB-dependent LTD in the hippocampus. Moreover, we show that eCB-dependent LTD in the amygdala and hippocampus shares major mechanistic features. These findings reveal the signaling pathway by which CB1 receptors mediate long-term effects of eCBs in two crucial brain structures. Furthermore, our results highlight a conserved mechanism of presynaptic plasticity in the brain.

AB  - Summary
Ca2+ signaling plays a central role in activity-dependent regulation of dendritic arborization, but key molecular mechanisms downstream of calcium elevation remain poorly understood. Here we show that the C-terminal region of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase CLICK-III (CL3)/CaMKIγ, a membrane-anchored CaMK, was uniquely modified by two sequential lipidification steps: prenylation followed by a kinase-activity-regulated palmitoylation. These modifications were essential for CL3 membrane anchoring and targeting into detergent-resistant lipid microdomains (or rafts) in the dendrites. We found that CL3 critically contributed to BDNF-stimulated dendritic growth. Raft insertion of CL3 specifically promoted dendritogenesis of cortical neurons by acting upstream of RacGEF STEF and Rac, both present in lipid rafts. Thus, CL3 may represent a key element in the Ca2+-dependent and lipid-raft-delineated switch that turns on extrinsic activity-regulated dendrite formation in developing cortical neurons.

AB  - Summary
Sodium (Na) homeostasis is crucial for life, and Na levels in body fluids are constantly monitored in the brain. The subfornical organ (SFO) is the center of the sensing responsible for the control of salt-intake behavior, where Nax channels are expressed in specific glial cells as the Na-level sensor. Here, we show direct interaction between Nax channels and α subunits of Na+/K+-ATPase, which brings about Na-dependent activation of the metabolic state of the glial cells. The metabolic enhancement leading to extensive lactate production was observed in the SFO of wild-type mice, but not of the Nax-knockout mice. Furthermore, lactate, as well as Na, stimulated the activity of GABAergic neurons in the SFO. These results suggest that the information on a physiological increase of the Na level in body fluids sensed by Nax in glial cells is transmitted to neurons by lactate as a mediator to regulate neural activities of the SFO.

Here, we have reviewed work addressing the mechanisms underlying this timed cell genesis, with a particular focus on the developing cortex. These studies have defined an intriguing interplay between intrinsic epigenetic status, transcription factors, and environmental cues, all of which work together to establish this fascinating and complex biological timing mechanism.

AB  - Summary
The cytoskeletal regulators that mediate the change in the neuronal cytoskeletal machinery from one that promotes oriented motility to one that facilitates differentiation at the appropriate locations in the developing neocortex remain unknown. We found that Nck-associated protein 1 (Nap1), an adaptor protein thought to modulate actin nucleation, is selectively expressed in the developing cortical plate, where neurons terminate their migration and initiate laminar-specific differentiation. Loss of Nap1 function disrupts neuronal differentiation. Premature expression of Nap1 in migrating neurons retards migration and promotes postmigratory differentiation. Nap1 gene mutation in mice leads to neural tube and neuronal differentiation defects. Disruption of Nap1 retards the ability to localize key actin cytoskeletal regulators such as WAVE1 to the protrusive edges where they are needed to elaborate process outgrowth. Thus, Nap1 plays an essential role in facilitating neuronal cytoskeletal changes underlying the postmigratory differentiation of cortical neurons, a critical step in functional wiring of the cortex.

AB  - Summary
We reported previously that calpain-mediated Cdk5 activation is critical for mitochondrial toxin-induced dopaminergic death. Here, we report a target that mediates this loss. Prx2, an antioxidant enzyme, binds Cdk5/p35. Prx2 is phosphorylated at T89 in neurons treated with MPP+ and/or MPTP in animals in a calpain/Cdk5/p35-dependent manner. This phosphorylation reduces Prx2 peroxidase activity. Consistent with this, p35−/− neurons show reduced oxidative stress upon MPP+ treatment. Expression of Prx2 and Prx2T89A, but not the phosphorylation mimic Prx2T89E, protects cultured and adult neurons following mitochondrial insult. Finally, downregulation of Prx2 increases oxidative stress and sensitivity to MPP+. We propose a mechanistic model by which mitochondrial toxin leads to calpain-mediated Cdk5 activation, reduced Prx2 activity, and decreased capacity to eliminate ROS. Importantly, increased Prx2 phosphorylation also occurs in nigral neurons from postmortem tissue from Parkinson's disease patients when compared to control, suggesting the relevance of this pathway in the human condition.

AB  - Summary
Within the medial frontal cortex, the supplementary eye field (SEF), supplementary motor area (SMA), and pre-SMA have been implicated in the control of voluntary action, especially during motor sequences or tasks involving rapid choices between competing response plans. However, the precise roles of these areas remain controversial. Here, we study two extremely rare patients with microlesions of the SEF and SMA to demonstrate that these areas are critically involved in unconscious and involuntary motor control. We employed masked-prime stimuli that evoked automatic inhibition in healthy people and control patients with lateral premotor or pre-SMA damage. In contrast, our SEF/SMA patients showed a complete reversal of the normal inhibitory effect—ocular or manual—corresponding to the functional subregion lesioned. These findings imply that the SEF and SMA mediate automatic effector-specific suppression of motor plans. This automatic mechanism may contribute to the participation of these areas in the voluntary control of action.

AB  - Summary
microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, noncoding RNAs that regulate the stability or translation of mRNA transcripts. Although recent work has implicated miRNAs in development and in disease, the expression and function of miRNAs in the adult mammalian nervous system have not been extensively characterized. Here, we examine the role of two brain-specific miRNAs, miR-219 and miR-132, in modulating the circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. miR-219 is a target of the CLOCK and BMAL1 complex, exhibits robust circadian rhythms of expression, and the in vivo knockdown of miR-219 lengthens the circadian period. miR-132 is induced by photic entrainment cues via a MAPK/CREB-dependent mechanism, modulates clock-gene expression, and attenuates the entraining effects of light. Collectively, these data reveal miRNAs as clock- and light-regulated genes and provide a mechanistic examination of their roles as effectors of pacemaker activity and entrainment.

AB  - Clinical pain is a serious public health issue. Treatment of pain-related suffering requires knowledge of how pain signals are initially interpreted and subsequently transmitted and perpetuated. This review article is one of three reviews in this issue of Neuron that address our understanding of the pain process and possible solutions to the problem from both cellular- and systems-level viewpoints.

In order to deal effectively with danger, it is imperative to know about it. This is what nociceptors do—these primary sensory neurons are specialized to detect intense stimuli and represent, therefore, the first line of defense against any potentially threatening or damaging environmental inputs. By sensing noxious stimuli and contributing to the necessary reactions to avoid them—rapid withdrawal and the experience of an intensely unpleasant or painful sensation, nociceptors are essential for the maintenance of the body's integrity. Although nociceptive pain is clearly an adaptive alarm system, persistent pain is maladaptive, essentially an ongoing false alarm. Here, we highlight the genesis of nociceptors during development and the intrinsic properties of nociceptors that enable them to transduce, conduct, and transmit nociceptive information and also discuss how their phenotypic plasticity contributes to clinical pain.

AB  - Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a technique for noninvasive stimulation of the human brain. Stimulation is produced by generating a brief, high-intensity magnetic field by passing a brief electric current through a magnetic coil. The field can excite or inhibit a small area of brain below the coil. All parts of the brain just beneath the skull can be influenced, but most studies have been of the motor cortex where a focal muscle twitch can be produced, called the motor-evoked potential. The technique can be used to map brain function and explore the excitability of different regions. Brief interference has allowed mapping of many sensory, motor, and cognitive functions. TMS has some clinical utility, and, because it can influence brain function if delivered repetitively, it is being developed for various therapeutic purposes.

Expectations, positive or negative, are modulating factors influencing behavior. They are also thought to underlie placebo effects, impacting perceptions and biological processes. Using healthy human subjects, we examined the role of the nucleus accumbens (NAC), a region centrally involved in the encoding of reward expectation, in the formation of placebo responses. Employing functional molecular imaging, activation of NAC dopamine (DA) release was observed during placebo administration and related to its anticipated effects, perception-anticipation mismatches, and placebo effect development. In additional functional MRI studies, the expectation of monetary gain increased NAC synaptic activity in a manner proportional to placebo-induced DA release, anticipated effects, perception-anticipation differentials, and actual placebo effects. Individual variations in NAC response to reward expectation accounted for 28% of the variance in the formation of placebo analgesia.

AB  - Summary
In the mouse telencephalon, Dlx homeobox transcription factors are essential for the tangential migration of subpallial-derived GABAergic interneurons to neocortex. However, the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Dlx1/2 has a central role in restraining neurite growth of subpallial-derived immature interneurons at a stage when they migrate tangentially to cortex. In Dlx1−/−;Dlx2−/− mutants, neurite length is increased and cells fail to migrate. In Dlx1−/−;Dlx2+/− mutants, while the tangential migration of immature interneurons appears normal, they develop dendritic and axonal processes with increased length and decreased branching, and have deficits in their neocortical laminar positions. Thus, Dlx1/2 is required for coordinating programs of neurite maturation and migration. In this regard, we provide genetic evidence that in immature interneurons Dlx1/2 repression of the p21-activated serine/threonine kinase PAK3, a downstream effector of the Rho family of GTPases, is critical in restraining neurite growth and promoting tangential migration.

AB  - Subliminal stimuli, of which subjects are unaware, affect movements made to subsequent visible cues. Sumner and colleagues in this issue of Neuron show that restricted supplementary motor and eye field lesions compromise voluntary control of action because they disrupt the normal unconscious and automatic inhibition of alternative movements partially activated by subliminal stimuli.

AB  - Summary
Voltage-gated A-type K+ channel Kv4.2 subunits are highly expressed in the dendrites of hippocampal CA1 neurons. However, little is known about the subcellular distribution and trafficking of Kv4.2-containing channels. Here we provide evidence for activity-dependent trafficking of Kv4.2 in hippocampal spines and dendrites. Live imaging and electrophysiological recordings showed that Kv4.2 internalization is induced rapidly upon glutamate receptor stimulation. Kv4.2 internalization was clathrin mediated and required NMDA receptor activation and Ca2+ influx. In dissociated hippocampal neurons, mEPSC amplitude depended on functional Kv4.2 expression level and was enhanced by stimuli that induced Kv4.2 internalization. Long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by brief glycine application resulted in synaptic insertion of GluR1-containing AMPA receptors along with Kv4.2 internalization. We also found evidence of Kv4.2 internalization upon synaptically evoked LTP in CA1 neurons of hippocampal slice cultures. These results present an additional mechanism for synaptic integration and plasticity through the activity-dependent regulation of Kv4.2 channel surface expression.

AB  - How objects are represented in the visual system is one of the big questions in cognitive neuroscience. In this issue of Neuron, Mahon and colleagues present an intriguing study that suggests that properties of objects other than shape can influence the arrangement of object selectivities in visual areas. In the process, the study also points to important caveats regarding the ability of standard fMRI studies to make inferences about neuronal selectivity.

AB  - Summary
Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a recently recognized neurodegenerative disorder in fragile X premutation carriers with FMR1 alleles containing 55–200 CGG repeats. Previously, we developed a Drosophila model of FXTAS and demonstrated that transcribed premutation repeats alone are sufficient to cause neurodegeneration, suggesting that rCGG-repeat-binding proteins (RBPs) may be sequestered from their normal function by rCGG binding. Here, we identify Pur α and hnRNP A2/B1 as RBPs. We show that Pur α and rCGG repeats interact in a sequence-specific fashion that is conserved between mammals and Drosophila. Overexpression of Pur α in Drosophila could suppress rCGG-mediated neurodegeneration in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, Pur α is also present in the inclusions of FXTAS patient brains. These findings support the disease mechanism of FXTAS of rCGG repeat sequestration of specific RBPs, leading to neuronal cell death, and implicate that Pur α plays an important role in the pathogenesis of FXTAS.

AB  - Summary
Photolysis of a caged Ca2+ compound was used to characterize the dependence of cerebellar long-term synaptic depression (LTD) on postsynaptic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). Elevating [Ca2+]i was sufficient to induce LTD without requiring any of the other signals produced by synaptic activity. A sigmoidal relationship between [Ca2+]i and LTD indicated a highly cooperative triggering of LTD by Ca2+. The duration of the rise in [Ca2+]i influenced the apparent Ca2+ affinity of LTD, and this time-dependent behavior could be described by a leaky integrator process with a time constant of 0.6 s. A computational model, based on a positive-feedback cycle that includes protein kinase C and MAP kinase, was capable of simulating these properties of Ca2+-triggered LTD. Disrupting this cycle experimentally also produced the predicted changes in the Ca2+ dependence of LTD. We conclude that LTD arises from a mechanism that integrates postsynaptic Ca2+ signals and that this integration may be produced by the positive-feedback cycle.

AB  - Summary
The real world presents our sensory systems with a continuous stream of undifferentiated information. Segmentation of this stream at event boundaries is necessary for object identification and feature extraction. Here, we investigate the neural dynamics of event segmentation in entire musical symphonies under natural listening conditions. We isolated time-dependent sequences of brain responses in a 10 s window surrounding transitions between movements of symphonic works. A strikingly right-lateralized network of brain regions showed peak response during the movement transitions when, paradoxically, there was no physical stimulus. Model-dependent and model-free analysis techniques provided converging evidence for activity in two distinct functional networks at the movement transition: a ventral fronto-temporal network associated with detecting salient events, followed in time by a dorsal fronto-parietal network associated with maintaining attention and updating working memory. Our study provides direct experimental evidence for dissociable and causally linked ventral and dorsal networks during event segmentation of ecologically valid auditory stimuli.

AB  - Summary
β-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE) is required for production of the Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated Aβ protein. BACE levels are elevated in AD brain, and increasing evidence reveals BACE as a stress-related protease that is upregulated following cerebral ischemia. However, the molecular mechanism responsible is unknown. We show that increases in BACE and β-secretase activity are due to posttranslational stabilization following caspase activation. We also found that during cerebral ischemia, levels of GGA3, an adaptor protein involved in BACE trafficking, are reduced, while BACE levels are increased. RNAi silencing of GGA3 also elevated levels of BACE and Aβ. Finally, in AD brain samples, GGA3 protein levels were significantly decreased and inversely correlated with increased levels of BACE. In summary, we have elucidated a GGA3-dependent mechanism regulating BACE levels and β-secretase activity. This mechanism may explain increased cerebral levels of BACE and Aβ following cerebral ischemia and existing in AD.

AB  - Summary
Enduring forms of synaptic plasticity are thought to require ongoing regulation of adhesion molecules, such as N-cadherin, at synaptic junctions. Little is known about the activity-regulated trafficking of adhesion molecules. Here we demonstrate that surface N-cadherin undergoes a surprisingly high basal rate of internalization. Upon activation of NMDA receptors (NMDAR), the rate of N-cadherin endocytosis is significantly reduced, resulting in an accumulation of N-cadherin in the plasma membrane. β-catenin, an N-cadherin binding partner, is a primary regulator of N-cadherin endocytosis. Following NMDAR stimulation, β-catenin accumulates in spines and exhibits increased binding to N-cadherin. Overexpression of a mutant form of β-catenin, Y654F, prevents the NMDAR-dependent regulation of N-cadherin internalization, resulting in stabilization of surface N-cadherin molecules. Furthermore, the stabilization of surface N-cadherin blocks NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity. These results indicate that NMDAR activity regulates N-cadherin endocytosis, providing a mechanistic link between structural plasticity and persistent changes in synaptic efficacy.

AB  - Summary
Short-term synaptic plasticity influences how presynaptic spike patterns control the firing of postsynaptic targets. Here we investigated whether specific mechanisms of short-term plasticity are regulated in a target-dependent manner by comparing synapses made by cerebellar granule cell parallel fibers onto Golgi cells (PF→GC synapse) and Purkinje cells (PF→PC synapse). Both synapses exhibited similar facilitation, suggesting that any differential short-term plasticity does not reflect differences in the initial release probability. PF→PC synapses were highly sensitive to stimulus bursts, which could result in either depression of subsequent responses, mediated by endocannabinoid-dependent retrograde signaling, or enhancement of responses through posttetanic potentiation (PTP). In contrast, stimulus bursts had remarkably little effect on the strength of PF→GC synapses. Unlike PCs, GCs were unable to regulate their PF synapses by releasing endocannabinoids. Moreover, PTP was reduced at the PF→GC synapse compared to the PF→PC synapse. Thus, the target-dependence of PF synapses arises from the differential expression of both retrograde signaling and PTP.

AB  - Summary
The ability to orient and navigate through the terrestrial environment represents a computational challenge common to all vertebrates. It arises because motion sensors in the inner ear, the otolith organs, and the semicircular canals transduce self-motion in an egocentric reference frame. As a result, vestibular afferent information reaching the brain is inappropriate for coding our own motion and orientation relative to the outside world. Here we show that cerebellar cortical neuron activity in vermal lobules 9 and 10 reflects the critical computations of transforming head-centered vestibular afferent information into earth-referenced self-motion and spatial orientation signals. Unlike vestibular and deep cerebellar nuclei neurons, where a mixture of responses was observed, Purkinje cells represent a homogeneous population that encodes inertial motion. They carry the earth-horizontal component of a spatially transformed and temporally integrated rotation signal from the semicircular canals, which is critical for computing head attitude, thus isolating inertial linear accelerations during navigation.

AB  - Summary
How natural speech is represented in the auditory cortex constitutes a major challenge for cognitive neuroscience. Although many single-unit and neuroimaging studies have yielded valuable insights about the processing of speech and matched complex sounds, the mechanisms underlying the analysis of speech dynamics in human auditory cortex remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the phase pattern of theta band (4–8 Hz) responses recorded from human auditory cortex with magnetoencephalography (MEG) reliably tracks and discriminates spoken sentences and that this discrimination ability is correlated with speech intelligibility. The findings suggest that an ∼200 ms temporal window (period of theta oscillation) segments the incoming speech signal, resetting and sliding to track speech dynamics. This hypothesized mechanism for cortical speech analysis is based on the stimulus-induced modulation of inherent cortical rhythms and provides further evidence implicating the syllable as a computational primitive for the representation of spoken language.

A Nature article by Pandey et al. shows that this toxicity can be modulated by altering autophagic activity. Their tantalizing results suggest that overexpression of HDAC6 may increase flux through the autophagy pathway, thereby attenuating the toxicity resulting from proteasome inhibition.

AB  - Summary
Smooth-pursuit eye velocity to a moving target is more accurate after an initial catch-up saccade than before, an enhancement that is poorly understood. We present an individual-differences-based method for identifying mechanisms underlying a physiological response and use it to test whether visual motion signals driving pursuit differ pre- and postsaccade. Correlating moment-to-moment measurements of pursuit over time with two psychophysical measures of speed estimation during fixation, we find two independent associations across individuals. Presaccadic pursuit acceleration is predicted by the precision of low-level (motion-energy-based) speed estimation, and postsaccadic pursuit precision is predicted by the precision of high-level (position-tracking) speed estimation. These results provide evidence that a low-level motion signal influences presaccadic acceleration and an independent high-level motion signal influences postsaccadic precision, thus presenting a plausible mechanism for postsaccadic enhancement of pursuit.

AB  - Summary
The development of GABAergic inhibitory circuits is shaped by neural activity, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we demonstrate a novel function of GABA in regulating GABAergic innervation in the adolescent brain, when GABA is mainly known as an inhibitory transmitter. Conditional knockdown of the rate-limiting synthetic enzyme GAD67 in basket interneurons in adolescent visual cortex resulted in cell autonomous deficits in axon branching, perisomatic synapse formation around pyramidal neurons, and complexity of the innervation fields; the same manipulation had little influence on the subsequent maintenance of perisomatic synapses. These effects of GABA deficiency were rescued by suppressing GABA reuptake and by GABA receptor agonists. Germline knockdown of GAD67 but not GAD65 showed similar deficits, suggesting a specific role of GAD67 in the maturation of perisomatic innervation. Since intracellular GABA levels are modulated by neuronal activity, our results implicate GAD67-mediated GABA synthesis in activity-dependent regulation of inhibitory innervation patterns.

AB  - Summary
Agrin induces, whereas acetylcholine (ACh) disperses, ACh receptor (AChR) clusters during neuromuscular synaptogenesis. Such counteractive interaction leads to eventual dispersal of nonsynaptic AChR-rich sites and formation of receptor clusters at the postjunctional membrane. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here we show that calpain, a calcium-dependent protease, is activated by the cholinergic stimulation and is required for induced dispersion of AChR clusters. Interestingly, the AChR-associated protein rapsyn interacted with calpain in an agrin-dependent manner, and this interaction inhibited the protease activity of calpain. Disrupting the endogenous rapsyn/calpain interaction enhanced CCh-induced dispersion of AChR clusters. Moreover, the loss of AChR clusters in agrin mutant mice was partially rescued by the inhibition of calpain via overexpressing calpastatin, an endogenous calpain inhibitor, or injecting calpeptin, a cell-permeable calpain inhibitor. These results demonstrate that calpain participates in ACh-induced dispersion of AChR clusters, and rapsyn stabilizes AChR clusters by suppressing calpain activity.

AB  - Summary
Neuronal L-type calcium channels contribute to dendritic excitability and activity-dependent changes in gene expression that influence synaptic strength. Phosphorylation-mediated enhancement of L-type channels containing the CaV1.2 pore-forming subunit is promoted by A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) that target cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) to the channel. Although PKA increases L-type channel activity in dendrites and dendritic spines, the mechanism of enhancement in neurons remains poorly understood. Here, we show that CaV1.2 interacts directly with AKAP79/150, which binds both PKA and the Ca2+/calmodulin-activated phosphatase calcineurin (CaN). Cotargeting of PKA and CaN by AKAP79/150 confers bidirectional regulation of L-type current amplitude in transfected HEK293 cells and hippocampal neurons. However, anchored CaN dominantly suppresses PKA enhancement of the channel. Additionally, activation of the transcription factor NFATc4 via local Ca2+ influx through L-type channels requires AKAP79/150, suggesting that this signaling complex promotes neuronal L channel signaling to the nucleus through NFATc4.

AB  - Summary
Glutamate produces both fast excitation through activation of ionotropic receptors and slower actions through metabotropic receptors (mGluRs). To date, ionotropic but not metabotropic neurotransmission has been shown to undergo long-term synaptic potentiation and depression. Burst stimulation of parallel fibers releases glutamate, which activates perisynaptic mGluR1 in the dendritic spines of cerebellar Purkinje cells. Here, we show that the mGluR1-dependent slow EPSC and its coincident Ca transient were selectively and persistently depressed by repeated climbing fiber-evoked depolarization of Purkinje cells in brain slices. LTD(mGluR1) was also observed when slow synaptic current was evoked by exogenous application of a group I mGluR agonist, implying a postsynaptic expression mechanism. Ca imaging further revealed that LTD(mGluR1) was expressed as coincident attenuation of both limbs of mGluR1 signaling: the slow EPSC and PLC/IP3-mediated dendritic Ca mobilization. Thus, different patterns of neural activity can evoke LTD of either fast ionotropic or slow mGluR1-mediated synaptic signaling.

AB  - Summary
ThermoTRPs, a subset of the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) family of cation channels, have been implicated in sensing temperature. TRPM8 and TRPA1 are both activated by cooling; however, it is unclear whether either ion channel is required for thermosensation in vivo. We show that mice lacking TRPM8 have severe behavioral deficits in response to cold stimuli. In thermotaxis assays of temperature gradient and two-temperature choice assays, TRPM8-deficient mice exhibit strikingly reduced avoidance of cold temperatures. TRPM8-deficient mice also lack behavioral response to cold-inducing icilin application and display an attenuated response to acetone, an unpleasant cold stimulus. However, TRPM8-deficient mice have normal nociceptive-like responses to subzero centigrade temperatures, suggesting the presence of at least one additional noxious cold receptor. Finally, we show that TRPM8 mediates the analgesic effect of moderate cooling after administration of formalin, a painful stimulus. Therefore, depending on context, TRPM8 contributes to sensing unpleasant cold stimuli or mediating the effects of cold analgesia.

AB  - Summary
Kv7.x (KCNQ) voltage-gated potassium channels form the cardiac and auditory IKs current and the neuronal M-current. The five Kv7 subtypes have distinct assembly preferences encoded by a C-terminal cytoplasmic assembly domain, the A-domain Tail. Here, we present the high-resolution structure of the Kv7.4 A-domain Tail together with biochemical experiments that show that the domain is a self-assembling, parallel, four-stranded coiled coil. Structural analysis and biochemical studies indicate conservation of the coiled coil in all Kv7 subtypes and that a limited set of interactions encode assembly specificity determinants. Kv7 mutations have prominent roles in arrhythmias, deafness, and epilepsy. The structure together with biochemical data indicate that A-domain Tail arrhythmia mutations cluster on the solvent-accessible surface of the subunit interface at a likely site of action for modulatory proteins. Together, the data provide a framework for understanding Kv7 assembly specificity and the molecular basis of a distinct set of Kv7 channelopathies.

AB  - Summary
Volitional behavior relies on the brain's ability to remap sensory flow to motor programs whenever demanded by a changed behavioral context. To investigate the circuit basis of such flexible behavior, we have developed a biophysically based decision-making network model of spiking neurons for arbitrary sensorimotor mapping. The model quantitatively reproduces behavioral and prefrontal single-cell data from an experiment in which monkeys learn visuomotor associations that are reversed unpredictably from time to time. We show that when synaptic modifications occur on multiple timescales, the model behavior becomes flexible only when needed: slow components of learning usually dominate the decision process. However, if behavioral contexts change frequently enough, fast components of plasticity take over, and the behavior exhibits a quick forget-and-learn pattern. This model prediction is confirmed by monkey data. Therefore, our work reveals a scenario for conditional associative learning that is distinct from instant switching between sets of well-established sensorimotor associations.

AB  - Summary
Decisions based on the timing of sensory events are fundamental to sensory processing. However, the mechanisms by which the brain measures time over ranges of milliseconds to seconds remain unclear. The dominant model of temporal processing proposes that an oscillator emits events that are integrated to provide a linear metric of time. We examine an alternate model in which cortical networks are inherently able to tell time as a result of time-dependent changes in network state. Using computer simulations we show that within this framework, there is no linear metric of time, and that a given interval is encoded in the context of preceding events. Human psychophysical studies were used to examine the predictions of the model. Our results provide theoretical and experimental evidence that, for short intervals, there is no linear metric of time, and that time may be encoded in the high-dimensional state of local neural networks.

AB  - Summary
How does a visual search goal modulate the activity of neurons encoding different visual features (e.g., color, direction of motion)? Previous research suggests that goal-driven attention enhances the gain of neurons representing the target's visual features. Here, we present mathematical and behavioral evidence that this strategy is suboptimal and that humans do not deploy it. We formally derive the optimal feature gain modulation theory, which combines information from both the target and distracting clutter to maximize the relative salience of the target. We qualitatively validate the theory against existing electrophysiological and psychophysical literature. A surprising prediction is that it is sometimes optimal to enhance nontarget features. We provide experimental evidence toward this through psychophysics experiments on human subjects, thus suggesting that humans deploy the optimal gain modulation strategy.

AB  - Summary
In Parkinson disease (PD), α-synuclein aggregates called Lewy bodies often involve and sequester Septin4 (Sept4), a polymerizing scaffold protein. However, the pathophysiological significance of this phenomenon is unclear. Here, we show the physiological association of Sept4 with α-synuclein, the dopamine transporter, and other presynaptic proteins in dopaminergic neurons; mice lacking Sept4 exhibit diminished dopaminergic neurotransmission due to scarcity of these presynaptic proteins. These data demonstrate an important role for septin scaffolds in the brain. In transgenic mice that express human α-synucleinA53T (a mutant protein responsible for familial PD), loss of Sept4 significantly enhances neuropathology and locomotor deterioration. In this PD model, insoluble deposits of Ser129-phosphorylated α-synucleinA53T are negatively correlated with the dosage of Sept4. In vitro, direct association with Sept4 protects α-synuclein against self-aggregation and Ser129 phosphorylation. Taken together, these data show that Sept4 may be involved in PD as a dual susceptibility factor, as its insufficiency can diminish dopaminergic neurotransmission and enhance α-synuclein neurotoxicity.

AB  - Summary
Filamentous tau inclusions are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies, but earlier pathologies may herald disease onset. To investigate this, we studied wild-type and P301S mutant human tau transgenic (Tg) mice. Filamentous tau lesions developed in P301S Tg mice at 6 months of age, and progressively accumulated in association with striking neuron loss as well as hippocampal and entorhinal cortical atrophy by 9-12 months of age. Remarkably, hippocampal synapse loss and impaired synaptic function were detected in 3 month old P301S Tg mice before fibrillary tau tangles emerged. Prominent microglial activation also preceded tangle formation. Importantly, immunosuppression of young P301S Tg mice with FK506 attenuated tau pathology and increased lifespan, thereby linking neuroinflammation to early progression of tauopathies. Thus, hippocampal synaptic pathology and microgliosis may be the earliest manifestations of neurodegenerative tauopathies, and abrogation of tau-induced microglial activation could retard progression of these disorders.

AB  - Summary
In the brain, calcium influx following a train of action potentials activates potassium channels that mediate a slow afterhyperpolarization current (IsAHP). The key steps between calcium influx and potassium channel activation remain unknown. Here we report that the key intermediate between calcium and the sAHP channels is the diffusible calcium sensor hippocalcin. Brief depolarizations sufficient to activate the IsAHP in wild-type mice do not elicit the IsAHP in hippocalcin knockout mice. Introduction of hippocalcin in cultured hippocampal neurons leads to a pronounced IsAHP, while neurons expressing a hippocalcin mutant lacking N-terminal myristoylation exhibit a small IsAHP that is similar to that recorded in uninfected neurons. This implies that hippocalcin must bind to the plasma membrane to mediate its effects. These findings support a model in which the calcium sensor for the sAHP channels is not preassociated with the channel complex.

When stimulated strongly, a hair cell's mechanically sensitive hair bundle may consume ATP too rapidly for replenishment by diffusion. To provide a broad view of the bundle's protein complement, including those proteins participating in energy metabolism, we used shotgun mass spectrometry methods to identify proteins of purified chicken vestibular bundles. In addition to cytoskeletal proteins, proteins involved in Ca2+ regulation, and stress-response proteins, many of the most abundant bundle proteins that were identified by mass spectrometry were involved in ATP synthesis. After β-actin, the cytosolic brain isoform of creatine kinase was the next most abundant bundle protein; at ∼0.5 mM, creatine kinase is capable of maintaining high ATP levels despite 1 mM/s ATP consumption by the plasma-membrane Ca2+-ATPase. Consistent with this critical role in hair bundle function, the creatine kinase circuit is essential for high-sensitivity hearing as demonstrated by hearing loss in creatine kinase knockout mice.

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) have both been implicated in cognitive control, but their relative roles remain unclear. Here we recorded the activity of single neurons in both areas while monkeys performed a task that required them to switch between trials in which they had to look toward a flashed stimulus (prosaccades) and trials in which they had to look away from the stimulus (antisaccades). We found that ACC neurons had a higher level of task selectivity than PFC neurons during the preparatory period on trials immediately following a task switch. In ACC neurons, task selectivity was strongest after the task switch and declined throughout the task block, whereas task selectivity remained constant in the PFC. These results demonstrate that the ACC is recruited when cognitive demands increase and suggest a role for both areas in task maintenance and the implementation of top-down control.

We identified the transmembrane molecule Semaphorin-1a (Sema-1a) as an essential component to ensure glomerulus-specific axon segregation. Removal of sema-1a in ORNs does not affect the pathfinding toward their target area but disrupts local axonal convergence into a single glomerulus, resulting in two distinct targeting phenotypes: axons either intermingle with adjacent ORN classes or segregate according to their odorant receptor identity into ectopic sites. Differential Sema-1a expression can be detected among neighboring glomeruli, and mosaic analyses show that sema-1a functions nonautonomously in ORN axon sorting. These findings provide insights into the mechanism by which afferent interactions lead to synaptic specificity in the olfactory system.

AB  - Summary
Hallucinogens, including mescaline, psilocybin, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), profoundly affect perception, cognition, and mood. All known drugs of this class are 5-HT2A receptor (2AR) agonists, yet closely related 2AR agonists such as lisuride lack comparable psychoactive properties. Why only certain 2AR agonists are hallucinogens and which neural circuits mediate their effects are poorly understood. By genetically expressing 2AR only in cortex, we show that 2AR-regulated pathways on cortical neurons are sufficient to mediate the signaling pattern and behavioral response to hallucinogens. Hallucinogenic and nonhallucinogenic 2AR agonists both regulate signaling in the same 2AR-expressing cortical neurons. However, the signaling and behavioral responses to the hallucinogens are distinct. While lisuride and LSD both act at 2AR expressed by cortex neurons to regulate phospholipase C, LSD responses also involve pertussis toxin-sensitive heterotrimeric Gi/o proteins and Src. These studies identify the long-elusive neural and signaling mechanisms responsible for the unique effects of hallucinogens.

AB  - Summary
Object category learning is a fundamental ability, requiring the combination of “bottom-up” stimulus-driven with “top-down” task-specific information. It therefore may be a fruitful domain for study of the general neural mechanisms underlying cortical plasticity. A simple model predicts that category learning involves the formation of a task-independent shape-selective representation that provides input to circuits learning the categorization task, with the computationally appealing prediction of facilitated learning of additional, novel tasks over the same stimuli. Using fMRI rapid-adaptation techniques, we find that categorization training (on morphed “cars”) induced a significant release from adaptation for small shape changes in lateral occipital cortex irrespective of category membership, compatible with the sharpening of a representation coding for physical appearance. In contrast, an area in lateral prefrontal cortex, selectively activated during categorization, showed sensitivity posttraining to explicit changes in category membership. Further supporting the model, categorization training also improved discrimination performance on the trained stimuli.

AB  - Summary
A central question about the brain is how information is processed by large populations of neurons embedded in intricate local networks. Answering this question requires not only monitoring functional dynamics of many neurons simultaneously, but also interpreting such activity patterns in the context of neuronal circuitry. Here, we introduce a versatile approach for loading Ca2+ indicators in vivo by local electroporation. With this method, Ca2+ imaging can be performed both at neuron population level and with exquisite subcellular resolution down to dendritic spines and axon boutons. This enabled mitral cell odor-evoked ensemble activity to be analyzed simultaneously with revealing their specific connectivity to different glomeruli. Colabeling of Purkinje cell dendrites and intersecting parallel fibers allowed Ca2+ imaging of both presynaptic boutons and postsynaptic dendrites. This approach thus provides an unprecedented capability for in vivo visualizing active cell ensembles and tracing their underlying local neuronal circuits.

AB  - Summary
Accumulation of AMPA receptors at synapses is a fundamental feature of glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Stargazin, a member of the TARP family, is an AMPAR auxiliary subunit allowing interaction of the receptor with scaffold proteins of the postsynaptic density, such as PSD-95. How PSD-95 and Stargazin regulate AMPAR number in synaptic membranes remains elusive. We show, using single quantum dot and FRAP imaging in live hippocampal neurons, that exchange of AMPAR by lateral diffusion between extrasynaptic and synaptic sites mostly depends on the interaction of Stargazin with PSD-95 and not upon the GluR2 AMPAR subunit C terminus. Disruption of interactions between Stargazin and PSD-95 strongly increases AMPAR surface diffusion, preventing AMPAR accumulation at postsynaptic sites. Furthermore, AMPARs and Stargazin diffuse as complexes in and out synapses. These results propose a model in which the Stargazin-PSD-95 interaction plays a key role to trap and transiently stabilize diffusing AMPARs in the postsynaptic density.

AB  - Summary
Perisomatic inhibition provided by a subgroup of GABAergic interneurons plays a critical role in timing the output of pyramidal cells. To test their contribution at the network and the behavioral level, we generated genetically modified mice in which the excitatory drive was selectively reduced either by the knockout of the GluR-D or by conditional ablation of the GluR-A subunit in parvalbumin-positive cells. Comparable cell type-specific reductions of AMPA-mediated currents were obtained. Kainate-induced gamma oscillations exhibited reduced power in hippocampal slices from GluR-D−/− and GluR-APVCre−/− mice. Experimental and modeling data indicated that this alteration could be accounted for by imprecise spike timing of fast-spiking cells (FS) caused by smaller interneuronal EPSPs. GluR-D−/− and GluR-APVCre−/− mice exhibited similar impairments in hippocampus-dependent tasks. These findings directly show the effects of insufficient recruitment of fast-spiking cells at the network and behavioral level and demonstrate the role of this subpopulation for working and episodic-like memory.

AB  - Summary
Within the developing mammalian CNS, growth factors direct multipotent precursors to generate neurons versus glia, a process that if perturbed might lead to neural dysfunction. In this regard, genetic mutations resulting in constitutive activation of the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 cause Noonan Syndrome (NS), which is associated with learning disabilities and mental retardation. Here, we demonstrate that genetic knockdown of SHP-2 in cultured cortical precursors or in the embryonic cortex inhibited basal neurogenesis and caused enhanced and precocious astrocyte formation. Conversely, expression of an NS SHP-2 mutant promoted neurogenesis and inhibited astrogenesis. Neural cell-fate decisions were similarly perturbed in a mouse knockin model that phenocopies human NS. Thus, SHP-2 instructs precursors to make neurons and not astrocytes during the neurogenic period, and perturbations in the relative ratios of these two cell types upon constitutive SHP-2 activation may contribute to the cognitive impairments in NS patients.

AB  - Summary
Hippocampal mossy fibers project preferentially to the stratum lucidum, the proximal-most lamina of the suprapyramidal region of CA3. The molecular mechanisms that govern this lamina-restricted projection are still unknown. We examined the projection pattern of mossy fibers in mutant mice for semaphorin receptors plexin-A2 and plexin-A4, and their ligand, the transmembrane semaphorin Sema6A. We found that plexin-A2 deficiency causes a shift of mossy fibers from the suprapyramidal region to the infra- and intrapyramidal regions, while plexin-A4 deficiency induces inappropriate spreading of mossy fibers within CA3. We also report that the plexin-A2 loss-of-function phenotype is genetically suppressed by Sema6A loss of function. Based on these results, we propose a model for the lamina-restricted projection of mossy fibers: the expression of plexin-A4 on mossy fibers prevents them from entering the Sema6A-expressing suprapyramidal region of CA3 and restricts them to the proximal-most part, where Sema6A repulsive activity is attenuated by plexin-A2.

AB  - Summary
Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) has been implicated in major neurological disorders, but its role in normal neuronal function is largely unknown. Here we show that GSK3β mediates an interaction between two major forms of synaptic plasticity in the brain, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) and NMDA receptor-dependent long-term depression (LTD). In rat hippocampal slices, GSK3β inhibitors block the induction of LTD. Furthermore, the activity of GSK3β is enhanced during LTD via activation of PP1. Conversely, following the induction of LTP, there is inhibition of GSK3β activity. This regulation of GSK3β during LTP involves activation of NMDA receptors and the PI3K-Akt pathway and disrupts the ability of synapses to undergo LTD for up to 1 hr. We conclude that the regulation of GSK3β activity provides a powerful mechanism to preserve information encoded during LTP from erasure by subsequent LTD, perhaps thereby permitting the initial consolidation of learnt information.

AB  - RNA interference (RNAi), a mediator of gene silencing, has swiftly become one of the most exciting and applicable biological discoveries. There has been rapid progress in identifying RNAi pathway components and elucidating the mechanisms of microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and gene suppression. As a result, RNAi technologies have been successfully employed in a variety of systems as biological tools, and studies are underway to test the therapeutic utility of RNAi. In the span of several years, significant advances in the delivery of inhibitory RNAs in the nervous system have been made. We have glimpses into how endogenous miRNAs interface with neuronal development and function; in addition, RNAi has shown therapeutic efficacy in several mouse models of human neurological conditions. In this review, we summarize the current state-of-the-art of RNAi and its utility to neuroscientists.

AB  - Summary
Visual motion perception relies on two opposing operations: integration and segmentation. Integration overcomes motion ambiguity in the visual image by spatial pooling of motion signals, whereas segmentation identifies differences between adjacent moving objects. For visual motion area MT, previous investigations have reported that stimuli in the receptive field surround, which do not elicit a response when presented alone, can nevertheless modulate responses to stimuli in the receptive field center. The directional tuning of this “surround modulation” has been found to be mainly antagonistic and hence consistent with segmentation. Here, we report that surround modulation in area MT can be either antagonistic or integrative depending upon the visual stimulus. Both types of modulation were delayed relative to response onset. Our results suggest that the dominance of antagonistic modulation in previous MT studies was due to stimulus choice and that segmentation and integration are achieved, in part, via adaptive surround modulation.

AB  - Summary
Light deprivation lowers the threshold for long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) in visual cortex by a process termed metaplasticity, but the mechanism is unknown. The decreased LTD/P threshold correlates with a decrease in the ratio of NR2A to NR2B subunits of cortical NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and a slowing of NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). However, whether and how changes in NR2 subunit expression contribute to LTD and LTP have been controversial. In the present study, we used an NR2A knockout (KO) mouse to examine the role of this subunit in the experience-dependent modulation of NMDAR properties, LTD, and LTP. We found that deletion of NR2A abrogates the effects of visual experience on NMDAR EPSCs and prevents metaplasticity of LTP and LTD. These data support the hypothesis that experience-dependent changes in NR2A/B are functionally significant and yield a mechanism for an adjustable synaptic modification threshold in visual cortex.

AB  - Summary
Currently, no treatment can prevent the cognitive and motor decline associated with widespread neurodegeneration in prion disease. However, we previously showed that targeting endogenous neuronal prion protein (PrPC) (the precursor of its disease-associated isoform, PrPSc) in mice with early prion infection reversed spongiform change and prevented clinical symptoms and neuronal loss. We now show that cognitive and behavioral deficits and impaired neurophysiological function accompany early hippocampal spongiform pathology. Remarkably, these behavioral and synaptic impairments recover when neuronal PrPC is depleted, in parallel with reversal of spongiosis. Thus, early functional impairments precede neuronal loss in prion disease and can be rescued. Further, they occur before extensive PrPSc deposits accumulate and recover rapidly after PrPC depletion, supporting the concept that they are caused by a transient neurotoxic species, distinct from aggregated PrPSc. These data suggest that early intervention in human prion disease may lead to recovery of cognitive and behavioral symptoms.

AB  - Summary
We report a role for Nogo receptors (NgRs) in macrophage efflux from sites of inflammation in peripheral nerve. Increasing numbers of macrophages in crushed rat sciatic nerves express NgR1 and NgR2 on the cell surface in the first week after injury. These macrophages show reduced binding to myelin and MAG in vitro, which is reversed by NgR siRNA knockdown and by inhibiting Rho-associated kinase. Fourteen days after sciatic nerve crush, regenerating nerves with newly synthesized myelin have fewer macrophages than cut/ligated nerves that lack axons and myelin. Almost all macrophages in the cut/ligated nerves lie within the Schwann cell basal lamina, while in the crushed regenerating nerves the majority migrate out. Furthermore, crush-injured nerves of NgR1- and MAG-deficient mice and Y-27632-treated rats show impaired macrophage efflux from Schwann cell basal lamina containing myelinated axons. These data have implications for the resolution of inflammation in peripheral nerve and CNS pathologies.

AB  - Impaired cognitive flexibility after orbitofrontal damage has informed theories of orbitofrontal function and prefrontal cortex function generally. In this issue of Neuron, Stalnaker et al. demonstrate that reversal learning deficits after orbitofrontal damage in rats are eliminated by additional lesions of the basolateral amygdala. The involvement of orbitofrontal cortex in cognitive flexibility is via its interaction with the amygdala, and perhaps other brain areas, rather than an intrinsic property of this cortical region.

AB  - New genetic technologies are transforming nervous system studies in mice, impacting fields from neural development to the neurobiology of disease. Alongside these methodological advances, new concepts are taking shape with respect to both vocabulary and form. Here we review aspects of both burgeoning areas. Presented are technologies which, by co-opting site-specific recombinase systems, enable select genes to be turned on or off in specific brain cells of otherwise undisturbed mouse embryos or adults. Manipulated genes can be endogenous loci or inserted transgenes encoding reporter, sensor, or effector molecules, making it now possible to assess not only gene function, but also cell function, origin, fate, connectivity, and behavioral output. From these methodological advances, a new form of molecular neuroscience is emerging that may be said to lean on the concepts of genetic access, genetic lineage, and genetic anatomy—the three “Gs”—much like a general education rests on the basics of reading, ‘riting, and ‘rithmetic.

AB  - Summary
Synapses may undergo long-term increases or decreases in synaptic strength dependent on critical differences in the timing between pre-and postsynaptic activity. Such spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) follows rules that govern how patterns of neural activity induce changes in synaptic strength. Synaptic plasticity in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) follows Hebbian and anti-Hebbian patterns in a cell-specific manner. Here we show that these opposing responses to synaptic activity result from differential expression of two signaling pathways. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) signaling underlies Hebbian postsynaptic LTP in principal cells. By contrast, in interneurons, a temporally precise anti-Hebbian synaptic spike-timing rule results from the combined effects of postsynaptic CaMKII–dependent LTP and endocannabinoid-dependent presynaptic LTD. Cell specificity in the circuit arises from selective targeting of presynaptic CB1 receptors in different axonal terminals. Hence, pre- and postsynaptic sites of expression determine both the sign and timing requirements of long-term plasticity in interneurons.

AB  - The AMPA receptor (AMPAR) GluR2 subunit dictates the critical biophysical properties of the receptor, strongly influences receptor assembly and trafficking, and plays pivotal roles in a number of forms of long-term synaptic plasticity. Most neuronal AMPARs contain this critical subunit; however, in certain restricted neuronal populations and under certain physiological or pathological conditions, AMPARs that lack this subunit are expressed. There is a current surge of interest in such GluR2-lacking Ca2+-permeable AMPARs in how they affect the regulation of synaptic transmission. Here, we bring together recent data highlighting the novel and important roles of GluR2 in synaptic function and plasticity.

AB  - Summary
Thermosensation is an essential sensory function that is subserved by a variety of transducer molecules, including those from the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) ion channel superfamily. One of its members, TRPM8 (CMR1), a ligand-gated, nonselective cation channel, is activated by both cold and chemical stimuli in vitro. However, its roles in cold thermosensation and pain in vivo have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that sensory neurons derived from TRPM8 null mice lack detectable levels of TRPM8 mRNA and protein and that the number of these neurons responding to cold (18°C) and menthol (100 μM) is greatly decreased. Furthermore, compared with WT mice, TRPM8 null mice display deficiencies in certain behaviors, including icilin-induced jumping and cold sensation, as well as a significant reduction in injury-induced responsiveness to acetone cooling. These results suggest that TRPM8 may play an important role in certain types of cold-induced pain in humans.

AB  - Summary
Synaptotagmin-1 and -2 are known Ca2+ sensors for fast synchronous neurotransmitter release, but the potential Ca2+-sensor functions of other synaptotagmins in release remain uncharacterized. We now show that besides synaptotagmin-1 and -2, only synaptotagmin-9 (also called synaptotagmin-5) mediates fast Ca2+ triggering of release. Release induced by the three different synaptotagmin Ca2+ sensors exhibits distinct kinetics and apparent Ca2+ sensitivities, suggesting that the synaptotagmin isoform expressed by a neuron determines the release properties of its synapses. Conditional knockout mice producing GFP-tagged synaptotagmin-9 revealed that synaptotagmin-9 is primarily expressed in the limbic system and striatum. Acute deletion of synaptotagmin-9 in striatal neurons severely impaired fast synchronous release without changing the size of the readily-releasable vesicle pool. These data show that in mammalian brain, only synaptotagmin-1, -2, and -9 function as Ca2+ sensors for fast release, and that these synaptotagmins are differentially expressed to confer distinct release properties onto synapses formed by defined subsets of neurons.

AB  - Summary
The ability to stimulate select neurons in isolated tissue and in living animals is important for investigating their role in circuits and behavior. We show that the engineered light-gated ionotropic glutamate receptor (LiGluR), when introduced into neurons, enables remote control of their activity. Trains of action potentials are optimally evoked and extinguished by 380 nm and 500 nm light, respectively, while intermediate wavelengths provide graded control over the amplitude of depolarization. Light pulses of 1–5 ms in duration at ∼380 nm trigger precisely timed action potentials and EPSP-like responses or can evoke sustained depolarizations that persist for minutes in the dark until extinguished by a short pulse of ∼500 nm light. When introduced into sensory neurons in zebrafish larvae, activation of LiGluR reversibly blocks the escape response to touch. Our studies show that LiGluR provides robust control over neuronal activity, enabling the dissection and manipulation of neural circuitry in vivo.

AB  - Summary
It is often assumed that learning takes place by changing an otherwise stable neural representation. To test this assumption, we studied changes in the directional tuning of primate motor cortical neurons during reaching movements performed in familiar and novel environments. During the familiar task, tuning curves exhibited slow random drift. During learning of the novel task, random drift was accompanied by systematic shifts of tuning curves. Our analysis suggests that motor learning is based on a surprisingly unstable neural representation. To explain these results, we propose that motor cortex is a redundant neural network, i.e., any single behavior can be realized by multiple configurations of synaptic strengths. We further hypothesize that synaptic modifications underlying learning contain a random component, which causes wandering among synaptic configurations with equivalent behaviors but different neural representations. We use a simple model to explore the implications of these assumptions.

AB  - Summary
Many biological functions depend critically upon fine details of tissue molecular architecture that have resisted exploration by existing imaging techniques. This is particularly true for nervous system tissues, where information processing function depends on intricate circuit and synaptic architectures. Here, we describe a new imaging method, called array tomography, which combines and extends superlative features of modern optical fluorescence and electron microscopy methods. Based on methods for constructing and repeatedly staining and imaging ordered arrays of ultrathin (50–200 nm), resin-embedded serial sections on glass microscope slides, array tomography allows for quantitative, high-resolution, large-field volumetric imaging of large numbers of antigens, fluorescent proteins, and ultrastructure in individual tissue specimens. Compared to confocal microscopy, array tomography offers the advantage of better spatial resolution, in particular along the z axis, as well as depth-independent immunofluorescent staining. The application of array tomography can reveal important but previously unseen features of brain molecular architecture.

AB  - Summary
During development, neural precursors migrate in response to positional cues such as growth factor gradients. However, the mechanisms that enable precursors to sense and respond to such gradients are poorly understood. Here we show that cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCPs) migrate along a gradient of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and we demonstrate that vesicle trafficking is critical for this chemotactic process. Activation of TrkB, the BDNF receptor, stimulates GCPs to secrete BDNF, thereby amplifying the ambient gradient. The BDNF gradient stimulates endocytosis of TrkB and associated signaling molecules, causing asymmetric accumulation of signaling endosomes at the subcellular location where BDNF concentration is maximal. Thus, regulated BDNF exocytosis and TrkB endocytosis enable precursors to polarize and migrate in a directed fashion along a shallow BDNF gradient.

AB  - Summary
The progression of progenitors to oligodendrocytes requires proliferative arrest and the activation of a transcriptional program of differentiation. While regulation of cell cycle exit has been extensively characterized, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the initiation of differentiation remain ill-defined. Here, we identify the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) as a critical regulator of oligodendrocyte progenitor differentiation. Conditional ablation of yy1 in the oligodendrocyte lineage in vivo induces a phenotype characterized by defective myelination, ataxia, and tremor. At the cellular level, lack of yy1 arrests differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors after they exit from the cell cycle. At the molecular level, YY1 acts as a lineage-specific repressor of transcriptional inhibitors of myelin gene expression (Tcf4 and Id4), by recruiting histone deacetylase-1 to their promoters during oligodendrocyte differentiation. Thus, we identify YY1 as an essential component of the transcriptional network regulating the transition of oligodendrocyte progenitors from cell cycle exit to differentiation.

How does feature-based attention modulate neural responses? We used adaptation to quantify the effect of feature-based attention on orientation-selective responses in human visual cortex. Observers were adapted to two superimposed oblique gratings while attending to one grating only. We measured the magnitude of attention-induced orientation-selective adaptation both psychophysically, by the behavioral tilt aftereffect, and physiologically, using fMRI response adaptation. We found evidence for orientation-selective attentional modulation of neuronal responses—a lower fMRI response for the attended than the unattended orientation—in multiple visual areas, and a significant correlation between the magnitude of the tilt aftereffect and that of fMRI response adaptation in V1, the earliest site of orientation coding. These results show that feature-based attention can selectively increase the response of neuronal subpopulations that prefer the attended feature, even when the attended and unattended features are coded in the same visual areas and share the same retinotopic location.

AB  - In this issue of Neuron, Südhof and colleagues determine which of the eight Ca2+-binding synaptotagmin isoforms expressed in brain can support synchronous neurotransmitter release at mammalian CNS synapses. Unexpectedly, only three—synaptotagmin-1, -2, and -9—can serve as Ca2+ sensors for fast transmission. Further characterization reveals the unique ability of each isoform to shape neurotransmission.

AB  - Summary
The canonical Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway is important for a variety of developmental phenomena as well as for carcinogenesis. Here, we show that, in hippocampal neurons, NMDA-receptor-dependent activation of calpain induced the cleavage of β-catenin at the N terminus, generating stable, truncated forms. These β-catenin fragments accumulated in the nucleus and induced Tcf/Lef-dependent gene transcription. We identified Fosl1, one of the immediate-early genes, as a target of this signaling pathway. In addition, exploratory behavior by mice resulted in a similar cleavage of β-catenin, as well as activation of the Tcf signaling pathway, in hippocampal neurons. Both β-catenin cleavage and Tcf-dependent gene transcription were suppressed by calpain inhibitors. These findings reveal another pathway for β-catenin-dependent signaling, in addition to the canonical Wnt-β-catenin pathway, and suggest that this other pathway could play an important role in activity-dependent gene expression.

AB  - Summary
Drosophila mushroom bodies (MB) are bilaterally symmetric multilobed brain structures required for olfactory memory. Previous studies suggested that neurotransmission from MB neurons is only required for memory retrieval. Our unexpected observation that Dorsal Paired Medial (DPM) neurons, which project only to MB neurons, are required during memory storage but not during acquisition or retrieval, led us to revisit the role of MB neurons in memory processing. We show that neurotransmission from the α′β′ subset of MB neurons is required to acquire and stabilize aversive and appetitive odor memory, but is dispensable during memory retrieval. In contrast, neurotransmission from MB αβ neurons is only required for memory retrieval. These data suggest a dynamic requirement for the different subsets of MB neurons in memory and are consistent with the notion that recurrent activity in an MB α′β′ neuron-DPM neuron loop is required to stabilize memories formed in the MB αβ neurons.

AB  - Summary
Activation of the horizontal segment of the intraparietal sulcus (hIPS) has been observed in various number-processing tasks, whether numbers were conveyed by symbolic numerals (digits, number words) or by nonsymbolic displays (dot patterns). This suggests an abstract coding of numerical magnitude. Here, we critically tested this hypothesis using fMRI adaptation to demonstrate notation-independent coding of numerical quantity in the hIPS. Once subjects were adapted either to dot patterns or to Arabic digits, activation in the hIPS and in frontal regions recovered in a distance-dependent fashion whenever a new number was presented, irrespective of notation changes. This remained unchanged when analyzing the hIPS peaks from an independent localizer scan of mental calculation. These results suggest an abstract coding of approximate number common to dots, digits, and number words. They support the idea that symbols acquire meaning by linking neural populations coding symbol shapes to those holding nonsymbolic representations of quantities.

AB  - The lateral intraparietal area (LIP) is a subdivision of the inferior parietal lobe that has been implicated in the guidance of spatial attention. In a variety of tasks, LIP provides a “salience representation” of the external world—a topographic visual representation that encodes the locations of salient or behaviorally relevant objects. Recent neurophysiological experiments show that this salience representation incorporates information about multiple behavioral variables—such as a specific motor response, reward, or category membership—associated with the task-relevant object. This integration occurs in a wide variety of tasks, including those requiring eye or limb movements or goal-directed or nontargeting operant responses. Thus, LIP acts as a multifaceted behavioral integrator that binds visuospatial, motor, and cognitive information into a topographically organized signal of behavioral salience. By specifying attentional priority as a synthesis of multiple task demands, LIP operates at the interface of perception, action, and cognition.

AB  - Summary
Reliable activation of inhibitory pathways is essential for maintaining the balance between excitation and inhibition during cortical activity. Little is known, however, about the activation of these pathways at the level of the local neocortical microcircuit. We report a disynaptic inhibitory pathway among neocortical pyramidal cells (PCs). Inhibitory responses were evoked in layer 5 PCs following stimulation of individual neighboring PCs with trains of action potentials. The probability for inhibition between PCs was more than twice that of direct excitation, and inhibitory responses increased as a function of rate and duration of presynaptic discharge. Simultaneous somatic and dendritic recordings indicated that inhibition originated from PC apical and tuft dendrites. Multineuron whole-cell recordings from PCs and interneurons combined with morphological reconstructions revealed the mediating interneurons as Martinotti cells. Martinotti cells received facilitating synapses from PCs and formed reliable inhibitory synapses onto dendrites of neighboring PCs. We describe this feedback pathway and propose it as a central mechanism for regulation of cortical activity.

In this issue of Neuron, Mokeichev et al. use compelling statistical analysis to show that, rather than being evidence of deterministic synfire chains, such cortical motifs are bound to appear by chance due to the natural dynamics of voltage fluctuations in neurons.

AB  - Summary
In order to release neurotransmitter synchronously in response to a presynaptic action potential, synaptic vesicles must be both release competent and located close to presynaptic Ca2+ channels. It has not been shown, however, which of the two is the more decisive factor. We tested this issue at the calyx of Held synapse by combining Ca2+ uncaging and electrophysiological measurements of postsynaptic responses. After depletion of the synaptic vesicles that are responsible for synchronous release during action potentials, uniform elevation of intracellular Ca2+ by Ca2+ uncaging could still elicit rapid release. The Ca2+ sensitivity of remaining vesicles was reduced no more than 2-fold, which is insufficient to explain the slow-down of the kinetics of release (10-fold) observed during a depolarizing pulse. We conclude that recruitment of synaptic vesicles to sites where Ca2+ channels cluster, rather than fusion competence, is a limiting step for rapid neurotransmitter release in response to presynaptic action potentials.

AB  - Summary
Escape from the extremely stressful opiate withdrawal syndrome may motivate opiate seeking and taking. The corticotropin-releasing factor receptor-1 (CRF1) pathway mediates behavioral and endocrine responses to stress. Here, we report that genetic inactivation (CRF1−/−) as well as pharmacological antagonism of the CRF/CRF1 receptor pathway increased and prolonged the somatic expression of opiate withdrawal. Opiate-withdrawn CRF1−/− mice also showed aberrant CRF and dynorphin expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) and the striatum, indicating profound impairments in stress-responsive brain circuitry. Intake of nonstressful amounts of corticosterone effectively reduced the exaggerated somatic reactions of CRF1−/− mice to opiate withdrawal. Exogenous corticosterone also restored “wild-type-like” patterns of CRF and dynorphin gene expression in the PVN and the striatum of opiate-withdrawn CRF1−/− mice, respectively. The present findings unravel a key role for the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system and brain extra-hypothalamic CRF/CRF1 receptor circuitry in somatic, molecular, and endocrine alterations induced by opiate withdrawal.

AB  - Summary
NMDA receptors promote neuronal survival but also cause cell degeneration and neuron loss. The mechanisms underlying these opposite effects on neuronal fate are unknown. Whole-genome expression profiling revealed that NMDA receptor signaling is decoded at the genomic level through activation of two distinct, largely nonoverlapping gene-expression programs. The location of the NMDA receptor activated specifies the transcriptional response: synaptic NMDA receptors induce a coordinate upregulation of newly identified pro-survival genes and downregulation of pro-death genes. Extrasynaptic NMDA receptors fail to activate this neuroprotective program, but instead induce expression of Clca1, a putative calcium-activated chloride channel that kills neurons. These results help explain the opposing roles of synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors on neuronal fate. They also demonstrate that the survival function is implemented in neurons through a multicomponent system of functionally related genes, whose coordinate expression is controlled by specific calcium signal initiation sites.

Recent anatomical, physiological, and neuroimaging findings indicate multisensory convergence at early, putatively unisensory stages of cortical processing. The objective of this study was to confirm somatosensory-auditory interaction in A1 and to define both its physiological mechanisms and its consequences for auditory information processing. Laminar current source density and multiunit activity sampled during multielectrode penetrations of primary auditory area A1 in awake macaques revealed clear somatosensory-auditory interactions, with a novel mechanism: somatosensory inputs appear to reset the phase of ongoing neuronal oscillations, so that accompanying auditory inputs arrive during an ideal, high-excitability phase, and produce amplified neuronal responses. In contrast, responses to auditory inputs arriving during the opposing low-excitability phase tend to be suppressed. Our findings underscore the instrumental role of neuronal oscillations in cortical operations. The timing and laminar profile of the multisensory interactions in A1 indicate that nonspecific thalamic systems may play a key role in the effect.

We report the results of a genetic screen to identify molecules important for synapse formation and/or maintenance. siRNAs were used to decrease the expression of candidate genes in neurons, and synapse development was assessed. We surveyed 22 cadherin family members and demonstrated distinct roles for cadherin-11 and cadherin-13 in synapse development. Our screen also revealed roles for the class 4 Semaphorins Sema4B and Sema4D in the development of glutamatergic and/or GABAergic synapses. We found that Sema4D affects the formation of GABAergic, but not glutamatergic, synapses. Our screen also identified the activity-regulated small GTPase Rem2 as a regulator of synapse development. A known calcium channel modulator, Rem2 may function as part of a homeostatic mechanism that controls synapse number. These experiments establish the feasibility of RNAi screens to characterize the mechanisms that control mammalian neuronal development and to identify components of the genetic program that regulate synapse formation and/or maintenance.

AB  - Summary
The neural circuitry that constrains visual acuity in the CNS has not been experimentally identified. We show here that zebrafish blumenkohl (blu) mutants are impaired in resolving rapid movements and fine spatial detail. The blu gene encodes a vesicular glutamate transporter expressed by retinal ganglion cells. Mutant retinotectal synapses release less glutamate, per vesicle and per terminal, and fatigue more quickly than wild-type in response to high-frequency stimulation. In addition, mutant axons arborize more extensively, thus increasing the number of synaptic terminals and effectively normalizing the combined input to postsynaptic cells in the tectum. This presumably homeostatic response results in larger receptive fields of tectal cells and a degradation of the retinotopic map. As predicted, mutants have a selective deficit in the capture of small prey objects, a behavior dependent on the tectum. Our studies successfully link the disruption of a synaptic protein to complex changes in neural circuitry and behavior.

AB  - Summary
L-glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the human brain, activates a family of ligand-gated ion channels, the major subtypes of which are named AMPA, kainate, and NMDA receptors. In common with many signal transduction proteins, glutamate receptors are modulated by ions and small molecules, including Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, protons, polyamines, and steroids. Strikingly, the activation of kainate receptors by glutamate requires the presence of both Na+ and Cl− in the extracellular solution, and in the absence of these ions, receptor activity is abolished. Here, we identify the site and mechanism of action of anions. Surprisingly, we find that Cl− ions are essential structural components of kainate receptors. Cl− ions bind in a cavity formed at the interface between subunits in a dimer pair. In the absence of Cl−, dimer stability is reduced, the rate of desensitization increases, and the fraction of receptors competent for activation by glutamate drops precipitously.

AB  - Summary
Damage to orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has long been associated with deficits in reversal learning. OFC damage also causes inflexible associative encoding in basolateral amygdala (ABL) during reversal learning. Here we provide a critical test of the hypothesis that the reversal deficit in OFC-lesioned rats is caused by this inflexible encoding in ABL. Rats with bilateral neurotoxic lesions of OFC, ABL, or both areas were tested on a series of two-odor go/no-go discrimination problems, followed by two serial reversals of the final problem. As expected, all groups acquired the initial problems at the same rate, and rats with OFC lesions were slower to acquire the reversals than sham controls. This impairment was abolished by accompanying ABL lesions, while ABL lesions alone had no effect on reversal learning. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that OFC facilitates cognitive flexibility by promoting updating of associative encoding in downstream brain areas.

AB  - Summary
Targeting of synaptic molecules to their proper location is essential for synaptic differentiation and plasticity. PSD-95/Dlg proteins have been established as key components of the postsynapse. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating the synaptic targeting, assembly, and disassembly of PSD-95/Dlg are not well understood. Here we show that PAR-1 kinase, a conserved cell polarity regulator, is critically involved in controlling the postsynaptic localization of Dlg. PAR-1 is prominently localized at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Loss of PAR-1 function leads to increased synapse formation and synaptic transmission, whereas overexpression of PAR-1 has the opposite effects. PAR-1 directly phosphorylates Dlg at a conserved site and negatively regulates its mobility and targeting to the postsynapse. The ability of a nonphosphorylatable Dlg to largely rescue PAR-1-induced synaptic defects supports the idea that Dlg is a major synaptic substrate of PAR-1. Control of Dlg synaptic targeting by PAR-1-mediated phosphorylation thus constitutes a critical event in synaptogenesis.

AB  - Summary
The roles of voltage-sensitive sodium (Na) and calcium (Ca) channels located on dendrites and spines in regulating synaptic signals are largely unknown. Here we use 2-photon glutamate uncaging to stimulate individual spines while monitoring uncaging-evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (uEPSPs) and Ca transients. We find that, in CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute mouse hippocampal slices, CaV2.3 voltage-sensitive Ca channels (VSCCs) are found selectively on spines and act locally to dampen uncaging-evoked Ca transients and somatic potentials. These effects are mediated by a regulatory loop that requires opening of CaV2.3 channels, voltage-gated Na channels, small conductance Ca-activated potassium (SK) channels, and NMDA receptors. Ca influx through CaV2.3 VSCCs selectively activates SK channels, revealing the presence of functional Ca microdomains within the spine. Our results suggest that synaptic strength can be modulated by mechanisms that regulate voltage-gated conductances within the spine but do not alter the properties or numbers of synaptic glutamate receptors.

It is a commonly held view that numbers are represented in an abstract way in both parietal lobes. This view is based on failures to find differences between various notational representations. Here we show that by using relatively smaller voxels together with an adaptation paradigm and analyzing subjects on an individual basis it is possible to detect specialized numerical representations. The current results reveal a left/right asymmetry in parietal lobe function. In contrast to an abstract representation in the left parietal lobe, the numerical representation in the right parietal lobe is notation dependent and thus includes nonabstract representations. Our results challenge the commonly held belief that numbers are represented solely in an abstract way in the human brain.

AB  - Summary
Spatial neglect is a syndrome following stroke manifesting attentional deficits in perceiving and responding to stimuli in the contralesional field. We examined brain network integrity in patients with neglect by measuring coherent fluctuations of fMRI signals (functional connectivity). Connectivity in two largely separate attention networks located in dorsal and ventral frontoparietal areas was assessed at both acute and chronic stages of recovery. Connectivity in the ventral network, part of which directly lesioned, was diffusely disrupted and showed no recovery. In the structurally intact dorsal network, interhemispheric connectivity in posterior parietal cortex was acutely disrupted but fully recovered. This acute disruption, and disrupted connectivity in specific pathways in the ventral network, strongly correlated with impaired attentional processing across subjects. Lastly, disconnection of the white matter tracts connecting frontal and parietal cortices was associated with more severe neglect and more disrupted functional connectivity. These findings support a network view in understanding neglect.

AB  - Summary
The ventral spinal cord generates multiple inhibitory and excitatory interneuron subtypes from four cardinal progenitor domains (p0, p1, p2, p3). Here we show that cell-cell interactions mediated by the Notch receptor play a critical evolutionarily conserved role in the generation of excitatory v2aIN and inhibitory v2bIN interneurons. Lineage-tracing experiments show that the v2aIN and v2bIN develop from genetically identical p2 progenitors. The p2 daughter cell fate is controlled by Delta4 activation of Notch receptors together with MAML factors. Cells receiving Notch signals activate a transcription factor code that specifies the v2bIN fate, whereas cells deprived of Notch signaling express another code for v2aIN formation. Thus, our study provides insight into the cell-extrinsic signaling that controls combinatorial transcription factor profiles involved in regulating the process of interneuron subtype diversification.

AB  - Summary
Extinction of conditioned fear is an active learning process requiring N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), but the timing, location, and neural mechanisms of NMDAR-mediated processing in extinction are a matter of debate. Here we show that infusion of the NMDAR antagonist CPP into the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) prior to, or immediately after, extinction training impaired 24 hr recall of extinction. These findings indicate that consolidation of extinction requires posttraining activation of NMDARs within the vmPFC. Using multichannel unit recording, we observed that CPP selectively reduced burst firing in vmPFC neurons, suggesting that bursting in vmPFC is necessary for consolidation of extinction. In support of this, we found that the degree of bursting in infralimbic vmPFC neurons shortly after extinction predicted subsequent recall of extinction. We suggest that NMDAR-dependent bursting in the infralimbic vmPFC initiates calcium-dependent molecular cascades that stabilize extinction memory, thereby allowing for successful recall of extinction.

AB  - Summary
DNA methylation is a covalent chemical modification of DNA catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). DNA methylation is associated with transcriptional silencing and has been studied extensively as a lifelong molecular information storage mechanism put in place during development. Here we report that DNMT gene expression is upregulated in the adult rat hippocampus following contextual fear conditioning and that DNMT inhibition blocks memory formation. In addition, fear conditioning is associated with rapid methylation and transcriptional silencing of the memory suppressor gene PP1 and demethylation and transcriptional activation of the synaptic plasticity gene reelin, indicating both methyltransferase and demethylase activity during consolidation. DNMT inhibition prevents the PP1 methylation increase, resulting in aberrant transcription of the gene during the memory-consolidation period. These results demonstrate that DNA methylation is dynamically regulated in the adult nervous system and that this cellular mechanism is a crucial step in memory formation.

AB  - Summary
Nicotine enhances attention and working memory by activating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for these cognitive functions and is also rich in nAChR expression. Specific cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying nicotine's effects on cognition remain elusive. Here we show that nicotine exposure increases the threshold for synaptic spike-timing-dependent potentiation (STDP) in layer V pyramidal neurons of the mouse PFC. During coincident presynaptic and postsynaptic activity, nicotine reduces dendritic calcium signals associated with action potential propagation by enhancing GABAergic transmission. This results from a series of presynaptic actions involving different PFC interneurons and multiple nAChR subtypes. Pharmacological block of nAChRs or GABAA receptors prevented nicotine's actions and restored STDP, as did increasing dendritic calcium signals with stronger postsynaptic activity. Thus, by activating nAChRs distributed throughout the PFC neuronal network, nicotine affects PFC information processing and storage by increasing the amount of postsynaptic activity necessary to induce STDP.

AB  - Summary
Correlated neuronal activity is instrumental in the formation of networks, but its emergence during maturation is poorly understood. We have used multibeam two-photon calcium microscopy combined with targeted electrophysiological recordings in order to determine the development of population coherence from embryonic to postnatal stages in the hippocampus. At embryonic stages (E16–E19), synchronized activity is absent, and neurons are intrinsically active and generate L-type channel-mediated calcium spikes. At birth, small cell assemblies coupled by gap junctions spontaneously generate synchronous nonsynaptic calcium plateaus associated to recurrent burst discharges. The emergence of coherent calcium plateaus at birth is controlled by oxytocin, a maternal hormone initiating labour, and progressively shut down a few days later by the synapse-driven giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs) that synchronize the entire network. Therefore, in the developing hippocampus, delivery is an important signal that triggers the first coherent activity pattern, which is silenced by the emergence of synaptic transmission.

AB  - In hippocampal pyramidal neurons, calcium entry following an action potential burst results in a slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) that critically regulates subsequent excitability. Although this potassium current was described two decades ago, the mechanism whereby the rise in intracellular calcium generates the sAHP was, until now, not known. In this issue of Neuron, Tzingounis et al. now show that calcium binding to hippocalcin, a member of the NCS family, is one of the necessary steps involved in production of the sAHP.

AB  - Summary
After unilateral stroke, the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) in the intact hemisphere is often more active during movement of an affected limb. Whether this contributes to motor recovery is unclear. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate short-term reorganization in right PMd after transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) disrupted the dominant left PMd, which is specialized for action selection. Even when 1 Hz left PMd TMS had no effect on behavior, there was a compensatory increase in activity in right PMd and connected medial premotor areas. This activity was specific to task periods of action selection as opposed to action execution. Compensatory activation changes were both functionally specific and anatomically specific: the same pattern was not seen after TMS of left sensorimotor cortex. Subsequent TMS of the reorganized right PMd did disrupt performance. Thus, this pattern of functional reorganization has a causal role in preserving behavior after neuronal challenge.

AB  - Summary
A neuron's dendrites typically do not cross one another. This intrinsic self-avoidance mechanism ensures unambiguous processing of sensory or synaptic inputs. Moreover, some neurons respect the territory of others of the same type, a phenomenon known as tiling. Different types of neurons, however, often have overlapping dendritic fields. We found that Down's syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule (Dscam) is required for dendritic self-avoidance of all four classes of Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) neurons. However, neighboring mutant class IV da neurons still exhibited tiling, suggesting that self-avoidance and tiling differ in their recognition and repulsion mechanisms. Introducing 1 of the 38,016 Dscam isoforms to da neurons in Dscam mutants was sufficient to significantly restore self-avoidance. Remarkably, expression of a common Dscam isoform in da neurons of different classes prevented their dendrites from sharing the same territory, suggesting that coexistence of dendritic fields of different neuronal classes requires divergent expression of Dscam isoforms.

AB  - Summary
Neuroligins enhance synapse formation in vitro, but surprisingly are not required for the generation of synapses in vivo. We now show that in cultured neurons, neuroligin-1 overexpression increases excitatory, but not inhibitory, synaptic responses, and potentiates synaptic NMDAR/AMPAR ratios. In contrast, neuroligin-2 overexpression increases inhibitory, but not excitatory, synaptic responses. Accordingly, deletion of neuroligin-1 in knockout mice selectively decreases the NMDAR/AMPAR ratio, whereas deletion of neuroligin-2 selectively decreases inhibitory synaptic responses. Strikingly, chronic inhibition of NMDARs or CaM-Kinase II, which signals downstream of NMDARs, suppresses the synapse-boosting activity of neuroligin-1, whereas chronic inhibition of general synaptic activity suppresses the synapse-boosting activity of neuroligin-2. Taken together, these data indicate that neuroligins do not establish, but specify and validate, synapses via an activity-dependent mechanism, with different neuroligins acting on distinct types of synapses. This hypothesis reconciles the overexpression and knockout phenotypes and suggests that neuroligins contribute to the use-dependent formation of neural circuits.

NGF controls survival, differentiation, and target innervation of both peptidergic and nonpeptidergic DRG sensory neurons. The common receptor for GDNF family ligands, Ret, is highly expressed in nonpeptidergic neurons, but its function during development of these neurons is unclear. Here, we show that expression of Ret and its coreceptors GFRα1 and GFRα2 is dependent on NGF. GFR/Ret signaling, in turn, autoregulates expression of both GFRα1 and GFRα2 and promotes expression of TrpA1, MrgA1, MrgA3, and MrgB4, acquisition of normal neuronal size, axonal innervation of the epidermis, and postnatal extinction of the NGF receptor TrkA. Moreover, NGF controls expression of several other genes characteristic of nonpeptidergic neurons, such as TrpC3, TrpM8, MrgD, and the transcription factor Runx1, via a Ret-independent signaling pathway. These findings support a model in which NGF controls maturation of nonpeptidergic DRG neurons through a combination of GFR/Ret-dependent and -independent signaling pathways.

AB  - Summary
Fragile X syndrome, caused by a mutation in the Fmr1 gene, is characterized by mental retardation. Several studies reported the absence of long-term potentiation (LTP) at neocortical synapses in Fmr1 knockout (FMR1-KO) mice, but underlying cellular mechanisms are unknown. We find that in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of FMR1-KO mice, spike-timing-dependent LTP (tLTP) is not so much absent, but rather, the threshold for tLTP induction is increased. Calcium signaling in dendrites and spines is compromised. First, dendrites and spines more often fail to show calcium transients. Second, the activity of L-type calcium channels is absent in spines. tLTP could be restored by improving reliability and amplitude of calcium signaling by increasing neuronal activity. In FMR1-KO mice that were raised in enriched environments, tLTP was restored to WT levels. Our results show that mechanisms for synaptic plasticity are in place in the FMR1-KO mouse PFC, but require stronger neuronal activity to be triggered.

The coordination of gene expression is critical for cell differentiation and the subsequent establishment of tissue function. We show here that a multiple zinc finger transcription factor, Zfp423/OAZ, is transiently expressed in newly differentiating olfactory-receptor neurons (ORNs) and has a key role in coordinating the expression of immature and mature stage-specific genes. OAZ deletion in mice impairs aspects of ORN differentiation, particularly the patterns of axonal projection to the olfactory bulb. OAZ gain-of-function experiments show that sustained OAZ expression throughout ORN maturation arrests ORN development at an immature stage and alters OR gene expression. Importantly, reintroducing OAZ expression in mature ORNs suppresses mature marker expression and reactivates immature-specific markers. Together, these experiments suggest that OAZ participates in a developmental switch regulating the transition from differentiation to maturation in ORNs.

AB  - Summary
Neuronal interactions between primary and secondary visual cortical areas are important for visual processing, but the spatiotemporal patterns of the interaction are not well understood. We used voltage-sensitive dye imaging to visualize neuronal activity in rat visual cortex and found visually evoked waves propagating from V1 to other visual areas. A primary wave originated in the monocular area of V1 and was “compressed” when propagating to V2. A reflected wave initiated after compression and propagated backward into V1. The compression occurred at the V1/V2 border, and local GABAA inhibition is important for the compression. The compression/reflection pattern provides a two-phase modulation: V1 is first depolarized by the primary wave, and then V1 and V2 are simultaneously depolarized by the reflected and primary waves, respectively. The compression/reflection pattern only occurred for evoked waves and not for spontaneous waves, suggesting that it is organized by an internal mechanism associated with visual processing.

AB  - Summary
The visual cortex represents stimuli through the activity of neuronal populations. We measured the evolution of this activity in space and time by imaging voltage-sensitive dyes in cat area V1. Contrast-reversing stimuli elicit responses that oscillate at twice the stimulus frequency, indicating that signals originate mostly in complex cells. These responses stand clear of the noise, whose amplitude decreases as 1/frequency, and yield high-resolution maps of orientation preference and retinotopy. We first show how these maps are combined to yield the responses to focal, oriented stimuli. We then study the evolution of the oscillating activity in space and time. In the orientation domain, it is a standing wave. In the spatial domain, it is a traveling wave propagating at 0.2–0.5 m/s. These different dynamics indicate a fundamental distinction in the circuits underlying selectivity for position and orientation, two key stimulus attributes.

AB  - Summary
The cortex contains multiple cell types, but studies of attention have not distinguished between them, limiting understanding of the local circuits that transform attentional feedback into improved visual processing. Parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons can be distinguished from pyramidal neurons based on their briefer action potential durations. We recorded neurons in area V4 as monkeys performed an attention-demanding task. We find that the distribution of action potential durations is strongly bimodal. Neurons with narrow action potentials have higher firing rates and larger attention-dependent increases in absolute firing rate than neurons with broad action potentials. The percentage increase in response is similar across the two classes. We also find evidence that attention increases the reliability of the neuronal response. This modulation is more than two-fold stronger among putative interneurons. These findings lead to the surprising conclusion that the strongest attentional modulation occurs among local interneurons that do not transmit signals between areas.

AB  - Summary
Visual word recognition has been proposed to rely on a hierarchy of increasingly complex neuronal detectors, from individual letters to bigrams and morphemes. We used fMRI to test whether such a hierarchy is present in the left occipitotemporal cortex, at the site of the visual word-form area, and with an anterior-to-posterior progression. We exposed adult readers to (1) false-font strings; (2) strings of infrequent letters; (3) strings of frequent letters but rare bigrams; (4) strings with frequent bigrams but rare quadrigrams; (5) strings with frequent quadrigrams; (6) real words. A gradient of selectivity was observed through the entire span of the occipitotemporal cortex, with activation becoming more selective for higher-level stimuli toward the anterior fusiform region. A similar gradient was also seen in left inferior frontoinsular cortex. Those gradients were asymmetrical in favor of the left hemisphere. We conclude that the left occipitotemporal visual word-form area, far from being a homogeneous structure, presents a high degree of functional and spatial hierarchical organization which must result from a tuning process during reading acquisition.

AB  - Summary
In the visual system, early atomized representations are grouped into higher-level entities through processes of perceptual organization. Here we present neurophysiological evidence that a representation of a simple object, a surface defined by color and motion, can be the unit of attentional selection at an early stage of visual processing. Monkeys were cued by the color of a fixation spot to attend to one of two transparent random-dot surfaces, one red and one green, which occupied the same region of space. Motion of the attended surface drove neurons in the middle temporal (MT) visual area more strongly than physically identical motion of the nonattended surface, even though both occurred within the spotlight of attention. Surface-based effects of attention persisted even without differential surface coloring, but attentional modulation was stronger with color. These results show that attention can select surface representations to modulate visual processing as early as cortical area MT.

AB  - Summary
Although prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the cognitive regulation of emotion, the cortical-subcortical interactions that mediate this ability remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we identified a right ventrolateral prefrontal region (vlPFC) whose activity correlated with reduced negative emotional experience during cognitive reappraisal of aversive images. We then applied a pathway-mapping analysis on subcortical regions to locate mediators of the association between vlPFC activity and reappraisal success (i.e., reductions in reported emotion). Results identified two separable pathways that together explained ∼50% of the reported variance in self-reported emotion: (1) a path through nucleus accumbens that predicted greater reappraisal success, and (2) a path through ventral amygdala that predicted reduced reappraisal success (i.e., more negative emotion). These results provide direct evidence that vlPFC is involved in both the generation and regulation of emotion through different subcortical pathways, suggesting a general role for this region in appraisal processes.

AB  - Summary
Decision making has recently emerged as a central theme in neurophysiological studies of cognition, and experimental and computational work has led to the proposal of a cortical circuit mechanism of elemental decision computations. This mechanism depends on slow recurrent synaptic excitation balanced by fast feedback inhibition, which not only instantiates attractor states for forming categorical choices but also long transients for gradually accumulating evidence in favor of or against alternative options. Such a circuit endowed with reward-dependent synaptic plasticity is able to produce adaptive choice behavior. While decision threshold is a core concept for reaction time tasks, it can be dissociated from a general decision rule. Moreover, perceptual decisions and value-based economic choices are described within a unified framework in which probabilistic choices result from irregular neuronal activity as well as iterative interactions of a decision maker with an uncertain environment or other unpredictable decision makers in a social group.

AB  - Summary
As a major output station of the basal ganglia, the globus pallidus internal segment (GPi) projects to the thalamus and brainstem nuclei thereby controlling motor behavior. A less well known fact is that the GPi also projects to the lateral habenula (LHb) which is often associated with the limbic system. Using the monkey performing a saccade task with positionally biased reward outcomes, we found that antidromically identified LHb-projecting neurons were distributed mainly in the dorsal and ventral borders of the GPi and that their activity was strongly modulated by expected reward outcomes. A majority of them were excited by the no-reward-predicting target and inhibited by the reward-predicting target. These reward-dependent modulations were similar to those in LHb neurons but started earlier than those in LHb neurons. These results suggest that GPi may initiate reward-related signals through its effects on the LHb, which then influences the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems.

AB  - Summary
Impaired degradation of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides could lead to Aβ accumulation, an early trigger of Alzheimer's disease (AD). How Aβ-degrading enzymes are regulated remains largely unknown. Cystatin C (CysC, CST3) is an endogenous inhibitor of cysteine proteases, including cathepsin B (CatB), a recently discovered Aβ-degrading enzyme. A CST3 polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of late-onset sporadic AD. Here, we identified CysC as the key inhibitor of CatB-induced Aβ degradation in vivo. Genetic ablation of CST3 in hAPP-J20 mice significantly lowered soluble Aβ levels, the relative abundance of Aβ1-42, and plaque load. CysC removal also attenuated Aβ-associated cognitive deficits and behavioral abnormalities and restored synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Importantly, the beneficial effects of CysC reduction were abolished on a CatB null background, providing direct evidence that CysC regulates soluble Aβ and Aβ-associated neuronal deficits through inhibiting CatB-induced Aβ degradation.

AB  - Neurons are submitted to an exceptional variety of stimuli and are able to convert these into high-order functions, such as storing memories, controlling behavior, and governing consciousness. These unique properties are based on the highly flexible nature of neurons, a characteristic that can be regulated by the complex molecular machinery that controls gene expression. Epigenetic control, which largely involves events of chromatin remodeling, appears to be one way in which transcriptional regulation of gene expression can be modified in neurons. This review will focus on how epigenetic control in the mature nervous system may guide dynamic plasticity processes and long-lasting cellular neuronal responses. We outline the molecular pathways underlying chromatin transitions, propose the presence of an “epigenetic indexing code,” and discuss how central findings accumulating at an exponential pace in the field of epigenetics are conceptually changing our perspective of adult brain function.

I argue that until the roles of nonneuronal cells are more fully understood and considered, neurobiology as a whole will progress only slowly.

AB  - Summary
When making a decision, one must first accumulate evidence, often over time, and then select the appropriate action. Here, we present a neural model of decision making that can perform both evidence accumulation and action selection optimally. More specifically, we show that, given a Poisson-like distribution of spike counts, biological neural networks can accumulate evidence without loss of information through linear integration of neural activity and can select the most likely action through attractor dynamics. This holds for arbitrary correlations, any tuning curves, continuous and discrete variables, and sensory evidence whose reliability varies over time. Our model predicts that the neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex involved in evidence accumulation encode, on every trial, a probability distribution which predicts the animal's performance. We present experimental evidence consistent with this prediction and discuss other predictions applicable to more general settings.

AB  - The dorsal striatum, which consists of the caudate and putamen, is the gateway to the basal ganglia. It receives convergent excitatory afferents from cortex and thalamus and forms the origin of the direct and indirect pathways, which are distinct basal ganglia circuits involved in motor control. It is also a major site of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Striatal plasticity alters the transfer of information throughout basal ganglia circuits and may represent a key neural substrate for adaptive motor control and procedural memory. Here, we review current understanding of synaptic plasticity in the striatum and its role in the physiology and pathophysiology of basal ganglia function.

AB  - Summary
KAP1 is an essential cofactor of KRAB-zinc finger proteins, a family of vertebrate-specific epigenetic repressors of largely unknown functions encoded in the hundreds by the mouse and human genomes. Here, we report that KAP1 is expressed at high levels and necessary for KRAB-mediated repression in mature neurons of the mouse brain. Mice deleted for KAP1 in the adult forebrain exhibit heightened levels of anxiety-like and exploratory activity and stress-induced alterations in spatial learning and memory. In the hippocampus, a small number of genes are dysregulated, including some imprinted genes. Chromatin analyses of the promoters of two genes markedly upregulated in knockout mice reveal decreased histone 3 K9-trimethylation and increased histone 3 and histone 4 acetylation. We propose a model in which the tethering of KAP1-associated chromatin remodeling factors via KRAB-ZFPs epigenetically controls gene expression in the hippocampus, thereby conditioning responses to behavioral stress.

AB  - Summary
FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12) binds the immunosuppressant drugs FK506 and rapamycin and regulates several signaling pathways, including mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. We determined whether the brain-specific disruption of the FKBP12 gene in mice altered mTOR signaling, synaptic plasticity, and memory. Biochemically, the FKBP12-deficient mice displayed increases in basal mTOR phosphorylation, mTOR-Raptor interactions, and p70 S6 kinase (S6K) phosphorylation. Electrophysiological experiments revealed that FKBP12 deficiency was associated with an enhancement in long-lasting hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). The LTP enhancement was resistant to rapamycin, but not anisomycin, suggesting that altered translation control is involved in the enhanced synaptic plasticity. Behaviorally, FKBP12 conditional knockout (cKO) mice displayed enhanced contextual fear memory and autistic/obsessive-compulsive-like perseveration in several assays including the water maze, Y-maze reversal task, and the novel object recognition test. Our results indicate that FKBP12 plays a critical role in the regulation of mTOR-Raptor interactions, LTP, memory, and perseverative behaviors.

AB  - Summary
Animal studies have shown that acetylcholine decreases excitatory receptive field size and spread of excitation in early visual cortex. These effects are thought to be due to facilitation of thalamocortical synaptic transmission and/or suppression of intracortical connections. We have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the spatial spread of responses to visual stimulation in human early visual cortex. The cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil was administered to normal healthy human subjects to increase synaptic levels of acetylcholine in the brain. Cholinergic enhancement with donepezil decreased the spatial spread of excitatory fMRI responses in visual cortex, consistent with a role of acetylcholine in reducing excitatory receptive field size of cortical neurons. Donepezil also reduced response amplitude in visual cortex, but the cholinergic effects on spatial spread were not a direct result of reduced amplitude. These findings demonstrate that acetylcholine regulates spatial integration in human visual cortex.

AB  - Summary
Controversy revolves around the differential contribution of NR2A- and NR2B-containing NMDA receptors, which coexist in principal forebrain neurons, to synaptic plasticity and learning in the adult brain. Here, we report genetically modified mice in which the NR2B subunit is selectively ablated in principal neurons of the entire postnatal forebrain or only the hippocampus. NR2B ablation resulted in smaller NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs with accelerated decay kinetics, as recorded in CA1 pyramidal cells. CA3-to-CA1 field LTP remained largely unaltered, although a pairing protocol revealed decreased NMDA receptor-mediated charge transfer and reduced cellular LTP. Mice lacking NR2B in the forebrain were impaired on a range of memory tasks, presenting both spatial and nonspatial phenotypes. In contrast, hippocampus-specific NR2B ablation spared hippocampus-dependent, hidden-platform water maze performance but induced a selective, short-term, spatial working memory deficit for recently visited places. Thus, both hippocampal and extra-hippocampal NR2B containing NMDA receptors critically contribute to spatial performance.

These include long-term potentiation and depression at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, as well as a variety of intrinsic and homeostatic plasticity mechanisms. A fundamental challenge for the field is to assemble our detailed knowledge of these specific mechanisms into a coherent picture of how plasticity within cortical circuits works to tune network properties.

AB  - Brain development was thought to be largely hardwired and accomplished by birth, and the brain was thought to have essentially no regenerative capacity. The remarkable discovery of adult neurogenesis and neural stem cells (NSCs) existing in the mature CNS changed that, allowing us to think optimistically about CNS repair. These discoveries helped to generate a robust field of neural progenitor cell biology, with relevance to CNS development, pathogenesis, the search for novel neurological therapies, as well as our understanding of how the brain works.

AB  - In the nervous system, many intracellular responses to elevated calcium are mediated by CaM kinases (CaMKs), a family of protein kinases whose activities are initially modulated by binding Ca2+/calmodulin and subsequently by protein phosphorylation. One member of this family, CaMKII, is well-established for its effects on modulating synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. However, recent studies indicate that some actions on neuronal development and function attributed to CaMKII may instead or in addition be mediated by other members of the CaMK cascade, such as CaMKK, CaMKI, and CaMKIV. This review summarizes key neuronal functions of the CaMK cascade in signal transduction, gene transcription, synaptic development and plasticity, and behavior. The technical challenges of mapping cellular protein kinase signaling pathways are also discussed.

AB  - Summary
Adaptive decision making requires selecting an action and then monitoring its consequences to improve future decisions. The neuronal mechanisms supporting action evaluation and subsequent behavioral modification, however, remain poorly understood. To investigate the contribution of posterior cingulate cortex (CGp) to these processes, we recorded activity of single neurons in monkeys performing a gambling task in which the reward outcome of each choice strongly influenced subsequent choices. We found that CGp neurons signaled reward outcomes in a nonlinear fashion and that outcome-contingent modulations in firing rate persisted into subsequent trials. Moreover, firing rate on any one trial predicted switching to the alternative option on the next trial. Finally, microstimulation in CGp following risky choices promoted a preference reversal for the safe option on the following trial. Collectively, these results demonstrate that CGp directly contributes to the evaluative processes that support dynamic changes in decision making in volatile environments.

AB  - Summary
A familial form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is linked to the D178N/V129 prion protein (PrP) mutation. Tg(CJD) mice expressing the mouse homolog of this mutant PrP synthesize a misfolded form of the mutant protein, which is aggregated and protease resistant. These mice develop clinical and pathological features reminiscent of CJD, including motor dysfunction, memory impairment, cerebral PrP deposition, and gliosis. Tg(CJD) mice also display electroencephalographic abnormalities and severe alterations of sleep-wake patterns strikingly similar to those seen in a human patient carrying the D178N/V129 mutation. Neurons in these mice show swelling of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with intracellular retention of mutant PrP, suggesting that ER dysfunction could contribute to the pathology. These results establish a transgenic animal model of a genetic prion disease recapitulating cognitive, motor, and neurophysiological abnormalities of the human disorder. Tg(CJD) mice have the potential for giving greater insight into the spectrum of neuronal dysfunction in prion diseases.

AB  - Summary
At hippocampal mossy fiber (MF)-st. lucidum interneuron (SLIN) synapses, mGluR7 serves as a metaplastic switch controlling bidirectional plasticity. mGluR7 activation during high-frequency stimulation (HFS) triggers presynaptic LTD due to persistent P/Q-type Ca2+ channel inhibition. However, following mGluR7 internalization HFS produces presynaptic LTP. Surprisingly, LTP is not a simple molecular reversal of Ca2+ channel depression. Rather, mGluR7 activation/internalization controls plasticity polarity by gating cAMP sensitivity of release. While naive surface mGluR7 expressing MF-SLIN synapses are insensitive to cAMP elevation, synapses that have internalized mGluR7 robustly potentiate following cAMP increases. Moreover, MF-SLIN LTP requires adenylate cyclase (AC) and protein kinase A (PKA) activities. We also discovered an association between mGluR7 and RIM1α, an active zone molecule required for AC/PKA-dependent presynaptic LTP. Importantly, the mGluR7-RIM1α interaction is regulated by mGluR7 activation, and mice lacking RIM1α are deficient in MF-SLIN LTP. We conclude that state-dependent cAMP sensitivity controlled by mGluR7-RIM1α interactions underlies MF-SLIN metaplasticity.

AB  - Summary
Studies of the innervation of limb muscles by spinal motor neurons have helped to define mechanisms by which axons establish trajectories to their targets. Related motor axons select dorsal or ventral pathways at the base of the limb, raising the question of how these alternate trajectories are specified. EphA signaling has been proposed to control the dorsal trajectory of motor axons in conjunction with other signaling systems, although the respective contributions of each system to motor axon guidance are unclear. We show that the expression of EphB receptors by motor axons, and ephrin-B ligands by limb mesenchymal cells, directs the ventral trajectory of motor axons. Our findings reveal symmetry in the molecular strategies that establish this aspect of nerve-muscle connectivity. The involvement of ephrin:Eph signaling in guiding both sets of motor axons raises the possibility that other signaling systems function primarily to refine or modulate a core Eph signaling program.

Impressive progress has been made, including evaluation of neural control signals, sensor testing in humans, signal decoding advances, and proof-of-concept validation. Most importantly, the field has demonstrated that persons with paralysis can use prototype systems for spelling, “point and click,” and robot control. Human and animal NI research is advancing knowledge about neural information processing and plasticity in healthy, diseased, and injured nervous systems. This emerging field promises a range of neurotechnologies able to return communication, independence, and control to people with movement limitations.

AB  - In this perspective I tell the story (albeit a clearly abridged version) of how our knowledge of ion conduction through ion channels has evolved from a purely electrical concept to a structural dynamics view of ions interacting with a membrane protein. Our progress in this field has shown steady growth over the years but has also been interspersed with sudden jumps of discovery. These leaps have normally been associated with the introduction of a new technical advance or the development of a new biological preparation; therefore, it is quite certain that we have not seen them all.

AB  - Summary
Visual analysis of faces and nonfacial body stimuli brings about neural activity in different cortical areas. Moreover, processing body form and body action relies on distinct neural substrates. Although brain lesion studies show specific face processing deficits, neuropsychological evidence for defective recognition of nonfacial body parts is lacking. By combining psychophysics studies with lesion-mapping techniques, we found that lesions of ventromedial, occipitotemporal areas induce face and body recognition deficits while lesions involving extrastriate body area seem causatively associated with impaired recognition of body but not of face and object stimuli. We also found that body form and body action recognition deficits can be double dissociated and are causatively associated with lesions to extrastriate body area and ventral premotor cortex, respectively. Our study reports two category-specific visual deficits, called body form and body action agnosia, and highlights their neural underpinnings.

AB  - Summary
T-brain gene-2 (Tbr2) is specifically expressed in the intermediate (basal) progenitor cells (IPCs) of the developing cerebral cortex; however, its function in this biological context has so far been overlooked due to the early lethality of Tbr2 mutant embryos. Conditional ablation of Tbr2 in the developing forebrain resulted in the loss of IPCs and their differentiated progeny in mutant cortex. Intriguingly, early loss of IPCs led to a decrease in cortical surface expansion and thickness with a neuronal reduction observed in all cortical layers. These findings suggest that IPC progeny contribute to the correct morphogenesis of each cortical layer. Our observations were confirmed by tracing Tbr2+ IPC cell fate using Tbr2::GFP transgenic mice. Finally, we demonstrated that misexpression of Tbr2 is sufficient to induce IPC identity in ventricular radial glial cells (RGCs). Together, these findings identify Tbr2 as a critical factor for the specification of IPCs during corticogenesis.

AB  - In this review we consider research on social cognition in which implicit processes can be compared and contrasted with explicit, conscious processes. In each case, their function is distinct, sometimes complementary and sometimes oppositional. We argue that implicit processes in social interaction are automatic and are often opposed to conscious strategies. While we are aware of explicit processes in social interaction, we cannot always use them to override implicit processes. Many studies show that implicit processes facilitate the sharing of knowledge, feelings, and actions, and hence, perhaps surprisingly, serve altruism rather than selfishness. On the other hand, higher-level conscious processes are as likely to be selfish as prosocial.

AB  - Summary
We demonstrate that distinct mechanisms of top-down control regulate, respectively, the sensitivity and gain of sensory responses in the owl's optic tectum (OT). Electrical microstimulation in the forebrain gaze control area, the arcopallial gaze field (AGF), results in a space-specific regulation of sensory responses in the OT. AGF microstimulation increases the responsiveness of OT neurons representing stimuli at the same location as that represented at the AGF site. We show that the mechanism that underlies this effect operates focally to enhance neuronal sensitivity and improve tuning consistency and spatial resolution. At the same time, AGF microstimulation decreases the responsiveness of OT neurons representing stimuli at all other locations. The mechanism that underlies this effect operates globally to modulate neuronal gain. The coordinated action of these different mechanisms can account for many of the reported effects of spatial attention on neural responses in monkeys and on behavioral performance in humans.

AB  - Summary
Although it has been tacitly assumed that the hippocampus exerts an influence on neocortical networks, the mechanisms of this process are not well understood. We examined whether and how hippocampal theta oscillations affect neocortical assembly patterns by recording populations of single cells and transient gamma oscillations in multiple cortical regions, including the somatosensory area and prefrontal cortex in behaving rats and mice. Laminar analysis of neocortical gamma bursts revealed multiple gamma oscillators of varying frequency and location, which were spatially confined and synchronized local groups of neurons. A significant fraction of putative pyramidal cells and interneurons as well as localized gamma oscillations in all recorded neocortical areas were phase biased by the hippocampal theta rhythm. We hypothesize that temporal coordination of neocortical gamma oscillators by hippocampal theta is a mechanism by which information contained in spatially widespread neocortical assemblies can be synchronously transferred to the associative networks of the hippocampus.

AB  - Mitochondrial electron transport generates the ATP that is essential for the excitability and survival of neurons, and the protein phosphorylation reactions that mediate synaptic signaling and related long-term changes in neuronal structure and function. Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that divide, fuse, and move purposefully within axons and dendrites. Major functions of mitochondria in neurons include the regulation of Ca2+ and redox signaling, developmental and synaptic plasticity, and the arbitration of cell survival and death. The importance of mitochondria in neurons is evident in the neurological phenotypes in rare diseases caused by mutations in mitochondrial genes. Mitochondria-mediated oxidative stress, perturbed Ca2+ homeostasis, and apoptosis may also contribute to the pathogenesis of prominent neurological diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases; stroke; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; and psychiatric disorders. Advances in understanding the molecular and cell biology of mitochondria are leading to novel approaches for the prevention and treatment of neurological disorders.

AB  - Summary
Neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation requires agrin, a factor released from motoneurons, and MuSK, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase that is activated by agrin. However, how signal is transduced from agrin to MuSK remains unclear. We report that LRP4, a low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)-related protein, is expressed specifically in myotubes and binds to neuronal agrin. Its expression enables agrin binding and MuSK signaling in cells that otherwise do not respond to agrin. Suppression of LRP4 expression in muscle cells attenuates agrin binding, agrin-induced MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation, and AChR clustering. LRP4 also forms a complex with MuSK in a manner that is stimulated by agrin. Finally, we showed that LRP4 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in agrin-stimulated muscle cells. These observations indicate that LRP4 is a coreceptor of agrin that is necessary for MuSK signaling and AChR clustering and identify a potential target protein whose mutation and/or autoimmunization may cause muscular dystrophies.

AB  - Summary
Little is known about ion channels that regulate the graded, subthreshold properties of nerve terminals. Using the calyx of Held, we demonstrate here a large presynaptic persistent Na+ current with unusually hyperpolarized activation voltage. This feature allowed the current to determine both the resting potential and resting conductance of the nerve terminal. Calyces express presynaptic glycine receptors whose activation depolarizes the synapse. We found that activation of the persistent Na+ current was an essential component in the response to glycine. This Na+ current originated at or very close to the terminal and was sustained even after trains of large spike-like depolarizations. Because Na+ channels also underlie the presynaptic action potential, we conclude that their action both triggers and modulates exocytosis through control of presynaptic membrane voltage.

We show that multiple suboptimal splice sites underlie the thermal-sensitive splicing of the period (per) 3′-terminal intron (dmpi8) from D. melanogaster, enabling this species to prolong its midday “siesta,” a mechanism that likely diminishes the deleterious effects of heat during the longer summer days in temperate climates. In D. yakuba and D. santomea, which have a more ancestral distribution indigenous to Afro-equatorial regions wherein day length and temperature exhibit little fluctuation throughout the year, the splicing efficiencies of their per 3′-terminal introns do not exhibit thermal calibration, consistent with the little effect of temperature on the daily distribution of activity in these species. We propose that the weak splice sites on dmpi8 underlie a mechanism that facilitated the acclimation of the widely colonized D. melanogaster (and possibly D. simulans) to temperate climates and that natural selection operating at the level of splicing signals plays an important role in the thermal adaptation of life forms.

AB  - Summary
Basal (intermediate) progenitors are the major source of neurons in the mammalian neocortex. The molecular machinery governing basal progenitor biogenesis is unknown. Here, we show that the zinc-finger transcription factor Insm1 (insulinoma-associated 1) is expressed specifically in progenitors undergoing neurogenic divisions, has a panneurogenic role throughout the brain, and promotes basal progenitor formation in the neocortex. Mouse embryos lacking Insm1 contained half the number of basal progenitors and showed a marked reduction in cortical plate radial thickness. Forced premature expression of Insm1 in neuroepithelial cells resulted in their mitosis occurring at the basal (rather than apical) side of the ventricular zone and induced expression of the basal progenitor marker Tbr2. Remarkably, these cells remained negative for Tis21, a marker of neurogenic progenitors, and did not generate neurons but underwent self-amplification. Our data imply that Insm1 is involved in the generation and expansion of basal progenitors, a hallmark of neocortex evolution.

AB  - Summary
Legal decision-making in criminal contexts includes two essential functions performed by impartial “third parties:” assessing responsibility and determining an appropriate punishment. To explore the neural underpinnings of these processes, we scanned subjects with fMRI while they determined the appropriate punishment for crimes that varied in perpetrator responsibility and crime severity. Activity within regions linked to affective processing (amygdala, medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex) predicted punishment magnitude for a range of criminal scenarios. By contrast, activity in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex distinguished between scenarios on the basis of criminal responsibility, suggesting that it plays a key role in third-party punishment. The same prefrontal region has previously been shown to be involved in punishing unfair economic behavior in two-party interactions, raising the possibility that the cognitive processes supporting third-party legal decision-making and second-party economic norm enforcement may be supported by a common neural mechanism in human prefrontal cortex.

AB  - Summary
Rats discriminate objects by scanning their surface with the facial vibrissae, producing spatiotemporally complex sequences of tactile contacts. The way in which the somatosensory cortex responds to these complex multivibrissal stimuli has not been explored. It is unclear yet whether contextual information from across the entire whisker pad influences cortical responses. Here, we delivered tactile stimuli to the rat vibrissae using a new 24 whisker stimulator. We tested sequences of rostrocaudal whisker deflections that generate multivibrissal motion patterns in different directions across the mystacial pad, allowing to disambiguate local from global sensory integration. Unitary electrophysiological recordings from different layers of the barrel cortex showed that a majority of neurons has direction selectivity for the multivibrissal stimulus. The selectivity resulted from nonlinear integration of responses across the mystacial pad. Our results indicate that the system extracts collective properties of a tactile scene.

Calcium/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) is required for LTP and experience-dependent potentiation in the barrel cortex. Here, we find that whisker deprivation increases LTP in the layer IV to II/III pathway and that PKA antagonists block the additional LTP. No LTP was seen in undeprived CaMKII-T286A mice, but whisker deprivation again unmasked PKA-sensitive LTP. Infusion of a PKA agonist potentiated EPSPs in deprived wild-types and deprived CaMKII-T286A point mutants but not in undeprived animals of either genotype. The PKA-dependent potentiation mechanism was not present in GluR1 knockouts. Infusion of a PKA antagonist caused depression of EPSPs in undeprived but not deprived cortex. LTD was occluded by whisker deprivation and blocked by PKA manipulation, but not blocked by cannabinoid antagonists. NMDA receptor currents were unaffected by sensory deprivation. These results suggest that sensory deprivation causes synaptic depression by reversing a PKA-dependent process that may act via GluR1.

AB  - Summary
Neuronal migration is a fundamental component of brain development whose failure is associated with various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Reelin is essential for the stereotypical inside-out sequential lamination of the neocortex, but the molecular mechanisms of its action still remain unclear. Here we show that regulation of Notch activity plays an important part in Reelin-signal-dependent neuronal migration. We found that Reelin-deficient mice have reduced levels of the cleaved form of Notch intracellular domain (Notch ICD) and that loss of Notch signaling in migrating neurons results in migration and morphology defects. Further, overexpression of Notch ICD mitigates the laminar and morphological abnormalities of migrating neurons in Reeler. Finally, our in vitro biochemical studies show that Reelin signaling inhibits Notch ICD degradation via Dab1. Together, our results indicate that neuronal migration in the developing cerebral cortex requires a Reelin-Notch interaction.

AB  - Developmental neurobiology has been greatly invigorated by a recent string of breakthroughs in molecular biology and optical physics that permit direct in vivo observation of neural circuit assembly. The imaging done thus far suggests that as brains are built, a significant amount of unbuilding is also occurring. We offer the view that this tumult is the result of the intersecting behaviors of the many single-celled creatures (i.e., neurons, glia, and progenitors) that inhabit brains. New tools will certainly be needed if we wish to monitor the myriad cooperative and competitive interactions at play in the cellular society that builds brains.

AB  - Summary
Daily sleep cycles in humans are driven by a complex circuit within which GABAergic sleep-promoting neurons oppose arousal. Drosophila sleep has recently been shown to be controlled by GABA, which acts on unknown cells expressing the Rdl GABAA receptor. We identify here the relevant Rdl-containing cells as PDF-expressing small and large ventral lateral neurons (LNvs) of the circadian clock. LNv activity regulates total sleep as well as the rate of sleep onset; both large and small LNvs are part of the sleep circuit. Flies mutant for pdf or its receptor are hypersomnolent, and PDF acts on the LNvs themselves to control sleep. These features of the Drosophila sleep circuit, GABAergic control of onset and maintenance as well as peptidergic control of arousal, support the idea that features of sleep-circuit architecture as well as the mechanisms governing the behavioral transitions between sleep and wake are conserved between mammals and insects.

AB  - Summary
Inferior temporal (IT) object representations have been intensively studied in monkeys and humans, but representations of the same particular objects have never been compared between the species. Moreover, IT's role in categorization is not well understood. Here, we presented monkeys and humans with the same images of real-world objects and measured the IT response pattern elicited by each image. In order to relate the representations between the species and to computational models, we compare response-pattern dissimilarity matrices. IT response patterns form category clusters, which match between man and monkey. The clusters correspond to animate and inanimate objects; within the animate objects, faces and bodies form subclusters. Within each category, IT distinguishes individual exemplars, and the within-category exemplar similarities also match between the species. Our findings suggest that primate IT across species may host a common code, which combines a categorical and a continuous representation of objects.

AB  - Summary
Drugs activating 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C receptors (5-HT2CRs) potently suppress appetite, but the underlying mechanisms for these effects are not fully understood. To tackle this issue, we generated mice with global 5-HT2CR deficiency (2C null) and mice with 5-HT2CRs re-expression only in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons (2C/POMC mice). We show that 2C null mice predictably developed hyperphagia, hyperactivity, and obesity and showed attenuated responses to anorexigenic 5-HT drugs. Remarkably, all these deficiencies were normalized in 2C/POMC mice. These results demonstrate that 5-HT2CR expression solely in POMC neurons is sufficient to mediate effects of serotoninergic compounds on food intake. The findings also highlight the physiological relevance of the 5-HT2CR-melanocortin circuitry in the long-term regulation of energy balance.

AB  - Summary
Aberrant cell-cycle activity and DNA damage are emerging as important pathological components in various neurodegenerative conditions. However, their underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that deregulation of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) activity by p25/Cdk5 induces aberrant cell-cycle activity and double-strand DNA breaks leading to neurotoxicity. In a transgenic model for neurodegeneration, p25/Cdk5 activity elicited cell-cycle activity and double-strand DNA breaks that preceded neuronal death. Inhibition of HDAC1 activity by p25/Cdk5 was identified as an underlying mechanism for these events, and HDAC1 gain of function provided potent protection against DNA damage and neurotoxicity in cultured neurons and an in vivo model for ischemia. Our findings outline a pathological signaling pathway illustrating the importance of maintaining HDAC1 activity in the adult neuron. This pathway constitutes a molecular link between aberrant cell-cycle activity and DNA damage and is a potential target for therapeutics against diseases and conditions involving neuronal death.

AB  - Summary
Decision making with several choice options is central to cognition. To elucidate the neural mechanisms of such decisions, we investigated a recurrent cortical circuit model in which fluctuating spiking neural dynamics underlie trial-by-trial stochastic decisions. The model encodes a continuous analog stimulus feature and is thus applicable to multiple-choice decisions. Importantly, the continuous network captures similarity between alternatives and possible overlaps in their neural representation. Model simulations accounted for behavioral as well as single-unit neurophysiological data from a recent monkey experiment and revealed testable predictions about the patterns of error rate as a function of the similarity between the correct and actual choices. We also found that the similarity and number of options affect speed and accuracy of responses. A mechanism is proposed for flexible control of speed-accuracy tradeoff, based on a simple top-down signal to the decision circuit that may vary nonmonotonically with the number of choice alternatives.

AB  - Summary
Although many transcription factors are known to control important aspects of neural development, the genome-wide programs that are directly regulated by these factors are not known. We have characterized the genetic program that is activated by MEF2, a key regulator of activity-dependent synapse development. These MEF2 target genes have diverse functions at synapses, revealing a broad role for MEF2 in synapse development. Several of the MEF2 targets are mutated in human neurological disorders including epilepsy and autism spectrum disorders, suggesting that these disorders may be caused by disruption of an activity-dependent gene program that controls synapse development. Our analyses also reveal that neuronal activity promotes alternative polyadenylation site usage at many of the MEF2 target genes, leading to the production of truncated mRNAs that may have different functions than their full-length counterparts. Taken together, these analyses suggest that the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor MEF2 regulates an intricate transcriptional program in neurons that controls synapse development.

AB  - Summary
Long-term potentiation (LTP) is accompanied by dendritic spine growth and changes in the composition of the postsynaptic density (PSD). We find that activity-dependent growth of apical spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons is accompanied by destabilization of the PSD that results in transient loss and rapid replacement of PSD-95 and SHANK2. Signaling through PSD-95 is required for activity-dependent spine growth and trafficking of SHANK2. N-terminal PDZ and C-terminal guanylate kinase domains of PSD-95 are required for both processes, indicating that PSD-95 coordinates multiple signals to regulate morphological plasticity. Activity-dependent trafficking of PSD-95 is triggered by phosphorylation at serine 73, a conserved calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) consensus phosphorylation site, which negatively regulates spine growth and potentiation of synaptic currents. We propose that PSD-95 and CaMKII act at multiple steps during plasticity induction to initially trigger and later terminate spine growth by trafficking growth-promoting PSD proteins out of the active spine.

Deciding in which direction to move is a ubiquitous feature of animal behavior, but the neural substrates of locomotor choices are not well understood. The superior colliculus (SC) is a midbrain structure known to be important for controlling the direction of gaze, particularly when guided by visual or auditory cues, but which may play a more general role in behavior involving spatial orienting. To test this idea, we recorded and manipulated activity in the SC of freely moving rats performing an odor-guided spatial choice task. In this context, not only did a substantial majority of SC neurons encode choice direction during goal-directed locomotion, but many also predicted the upcoming choice and maintained selectivity for it after movement completion. Unilateral inactivation of SC activity profoundly altered spatial choices. These results indicate that the SC processes information necessary for spatial locomotion, suggesting a broad role for this structure in sensory-guided orienting and navigation.

AB  - Summary
Neuronal activity-regulated gene expression has been suggested to be an important mediator of long-lasting, experience-dependent changes in the nervous system, but the activity-dependent component of gene transcription has never been selectively isolated and tested for its functional significance. Here, we demonstrate that introduction of a subtle knockin mutation into the mouse Bdnf gene that blocks the ability of the activity-regulated factor CREB to bind Bdnf promoter IV results in an animal in which the sensory experience-dependent induction of Bdnf expression is disrupted in the cortex. Neurons from these animals form fewer inhibitory synapses, have fewer spontaneous inhibitory quantal events, and exhibit reduced expression of inhibitory presynaptic markers in the cortex. These results indicate a specific requirement for activity-dependent Bdnf expression in the development of inhibition in the cortex and demonstrate that the activation of gene expression in response to experience-driven neuronal activity has important biological consequences in the nervous system.

AB  - Summary
We have altered the neural representation of odors in the brain by generating a mouse with a “monoclonal nose” in which greater than 95% of the sensory neurons express a single odorant receptor, M71. As a consequence, the frequency of sensory neurons expressing endogenous receptor genes is reduced 20-fold. We observe that these mice can smell, but odor discrimination and performance in associative olfactory learning tasks are impaired. However, these mice cannot detect the M71 ligand acetophenone despite the observation that virtually all sensory neurons and glomeruli are activated by this odor. The M71 transgenic mice readily detect other odors in the presence of acetophenone. These observations have implications for how receptor activation in the periphery is represented in the brain and how these representations encode odors.

Here we discuss how developments in molecular biology influenced the study of neuronal gene expression, and how this has shaped our understanding of neuronal development and function.

AB  - Summary
There are two major forms of long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission in the central nervous system that require activation of either N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) or metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). In synapses in the perirhinal cortex, we have directly compared the Ca2+ signaling mechanisms involved in NMDAR-LTD and mGluR-LTD. While both forms of LTD involve Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, the Ca2+ sensors involved are different; NMDAR-LTD involves calmodulin, while mGluR-LTD involves the neuronal Ca2+ sensor (NCS) protein NCS-1. In addition, there is a specific requirement for IP3 and PKC, as well as protein interacting with C kinase (PICK-1) in mGluR-LTD. NCS-1 binds directly to PICK1 via its BAR domain in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Furthermore, the NCS-1-PICK1 association is stimulated by activation of mGluRs, but not NMDARs, and introduction of a PICK1 BAR domain fusion protein specifically blocks mGluR-LTD.

AB  - Summary
Economists and cognitive psychologists have long known that prior rewards bias decision making in favor of options with high expected value. Accordingly, value modulates the activity of sensorimotor neurons involved in initiating movements toward one of two competing decision alternatives. However, little is known about how value influences the acquisition and representation of incoming sensory information or about the neural mechanisms that track the relative value of each available stimulus to guide behavior. Here, fMRI revealed value-related modulations throughout spatially selective areas of the human visual system in the absence of overt saccadic responses (including in V1). These modulations were primarily associated with the reward history of each stimulus and not to self-reported estimates of stimulus value. Finally, subregions of frontal and parietal cortex represent the differential value of competing alternatives and may provide signals to bias spatially selective visual areas in favor of more valuable stimuli.

Inhibitors of axonal regeneration in myelin are believed to be major contributors to the lack of regeneration in the adult CNS. Three of the four known myelin inhibitors, although very different structurally, interact with the same receptor, NgR. However, the absence of NgR has no effect on inhibition of neurite outgrowth in culture, and there is no improvement in CST regeneration in vivo. In a recent issue of Science, a second receptor for these myelin inhibitors was described, PirB, a receptor first described in the immune system. Will PirB be the answer to CST regeneration in vivo?

AB  - Neuroimaging, particularly that based upon functional magnetic resonance (fMRI), has become a dominant tool in cognitive neuroscience. This review provides a personal and selective perspective on its past, present, and future. Two trends currently characterize the field that broadly reflect a pursuit of “where”- and “how”-type questions. The latter addresses basic mechanisms related to the expression of task-induced neural activity and is likely to be an increasingly important theme in the future. This trend entails an enhanced symbiosis among investigators pursuing similar questions in fields such as computational and theoretical neuroscience as well as through the detailed analysis of microcircuitry.

AB  - Summary
β-site APP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1), the rate-limiting enzyme for β-amyloid (Aβ) production, is elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we show that energy deprivation induces phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α (eIF2α-P), which increases the translation of BACE1. Salubrinal, an inhibitor of eIF2α-P phosphatase PP1c, directly increases BACE1 and elevates Aβ production in primary neurons. Preventing eIF2α phosphorylation by transfection with constitutively active PP1c regulatory subunit, dominant-negative eIF2α kinase PERK, or PERK inhibitor P58IPK blocks the energy-deprivation-induced BACE1 increase. Furthermore, chronic treatment of aged Tg2576 mice with energy inhibitors increases levels of eIF2α-P, BACE1, Aβ, and amyloid plaques. Importantly, eIF2α-P and BACE1 are elevated in aggressive plaque-forming 5XFAD transgenic mice, and BACE1, eIF2α-P, and amyloid load are correlated in humans with AD. These results strongly suggest that eIF2α phosphorylation increases BACE1 levels and causes Aβ overproduction, which could be an early, initiating molecular mechanism in sporadic AD.

AB  - Summary
Neurons important for cognitive function are often classified by their morphology and integrative properties. However, it is unclear if within a single class of neuron these properties tune synaptic responses to the salient features of the information that each neuron represents. We demonstrate that for stellate neurons in layer II of the medial entorhinal cortex, the waveform of postsynaptic potentials, the time window for detection of coincident inputs, and responsiveness to gamma frequency inputs follow a dorsal-ventral gradient similar to the topographical organization of grid-like spatial firing fields of neurons in this area. We provide evidence that these differences are due to a membrane conductance gradient mediated by HCN and leak potassium channels. These findings suggest key roles for synaptic integration in computations carried out within the medial entorhinal cortex and imply that tuning of neural information processing by membrane ion channels is important for normal cognitive function.

AB  - Summary
Presynaptic autoreceptors modulate transmitter release at many synapses. At the mossy fiber to CA3 pyramidal cell (mf-CA3) synapse, two types of glutamatergic autoreceptors have been identified: transmitter release is reportedly suppressed by metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and augmented by kainate receptors (KARs). However, the net effect of these autoreceptors when activated by endogenous glutamate is unknown. Here, we show that during low-frequency mossy fiber stimulation, glutamate acting through presynaptic mGluRs substantially suppresses transmitter release. However, using similar recording conditions, we find that presynaptic KARs are insufficient to facilitate transmitter release over a wide range of mossy fiber stimulus frequencies, indicating that the uniquely robust mf-CA3 short-term plasticity is KAR independent. Furthermore, we report that actions generally attributed to presynaptic KARs are likely due to activation of recurrent CA3 network activity. Thus, negative feedback via presynaptic mGluRs is the dominant mode of glutamatergic autoregulation at the mf-CA3 synapse.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is characterized by abnormal elevation of Aβ peptide and abnormal hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein. The “amyloid hypothesis,” which is based on molecular defects observed in autosomal-dominant early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD), suggests a serial model of causality, whereby elevation of Aβ drives other disease features including tau hyperphosphorylation. Here, we review recent evidence from drug trials, genetic studies, and experimental work in animal models that suggests that an alternative model might exist in late-onset AD (LOAD), the complex and more common form of the disease. Specifically, we hypothesize a “dual pathway” model of causality, whereby Aβ and tau can be linked by separate mechanisms driven by a common upstream driver. This model may account for the results of recent drug trials and, if confirmed, may guide future drug development.

These findings mark a paradigmatic change in the way we understand and envision treating neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - Summary
Availability of genome-scale in situ hybridization data allows systematic analysis of genetic neuroanatomical architecture. Within the hippocampus, electrophysiology and lesion and imaging studies demonstrate functional heterogeneity along the septotemporal axis, although precise underlying circuitry and molecular substrates remain uncharacterized. Application of unbiased statistical component analyses to genome-scale hippocampal gene expression data revealed robust septotemporal molecular heterogeneity, leading to the identification of a large cohort of genes with robust regionalized hippocampal expression. Manual mapping of heterogeneous CA3 pyramidal neuron expression patterns demonstrates an unexpectedly complex molecular parcellation into a relatively coherent set of nine expression domains in the septal/temporal and proximal/distal axes with reciprocal, nonoverlapping boundaries. Unique combinatorial profiles of adhesion molecules within these domains suggest corresponding differential connectivity, which is demonstrated for CA3 projections to the lateral septum using retrograde labeling. This complex, discrete molecular architecture provides a novel paradigm for predicting functional differentiation across the full septotemporal extent of the hippocampus.

AB  - Summary
Perceptual experience consists of an enormous number of possible states. Previous fMRI studies have predicted a perceptual state by classifying brain activity into prespecified categories. Constraint-free visual image reconstruction is more challenging, as it is impractical to specify brain activity for all possible images. In this study, we reconstructed visual images by combining local image bases of multiple scales, whose contrasts were independently decoded from fMRI activity by automatically selecting relevant voxels and exploiting their correlated patterns. Binary-contrast, 10 × 10-patch images (2100 possible states) were accurately reconstructed without any image prior on a single trial or volume basis by measuring brain activity only for several hundred random images. Reconstruction was also used to identify the presented image among millions of candidates. The results suggest that our approach provides an effective means to read out complex perceptual states from brain activity while discovering information representation in multivoxel patterns.

The detection of diverse chemical structures by the vertebrate olfactory system is accomplished by the recognition of odorous ligands by their cognate receptors. In the present study, we used computational screening to discover novel high-affinity agonists of an olfactory G protein-coupled receptor that recognizes amino acid ligands. Functional testing of the top candidates validated several agonists with potencies higher than any of the receptor's known natural ligands. Computational modeling revealed molecular interactions involved in ligand binding and further highlighted interactions that have been conserved in evolutionarily divergent amino acid receptors. Significantly, the top compounds display robust activities as odorants in vivo and include a natural product that may be used to signal the presence of bacteria in the environment. Our virtual screening approach should be applicable to the identification of new bioactive molecules for probing the structure of chemosensory receptors and the function of chemosensory systems in vivo.

AB  - Summary
Pyramidal neurons of the neocortex can be subdivided into two major groups: deep- (DL) and upper-layer (UL) neurons. Here we report that the expression of the AT-rich DNA-binding protein Satb2 defines two subclasses of UL neurons: UL1 (Satb2 positive) and UL2 (Satb2 negative). In the absence of Satb2, UL1 neurons lose their identity and activate DL- and UL2-specific genetic programs. UL1 neurons in Satb2 mutants fail to migrate to superficial layers and do not contribute to the corpus callosum but to the corticospinal tract, which is normally populated by DL axons. Ctip2, a gene required for the formation of the corticospinal tract, is ectopically expressed in all UL1 neurons in the absence of Satb2. Satb2 protein interacts with the Ctip2 genomic region and controls chromatin remodeling at this locus. Satb2 therefore is required for the initiation of the UL1-specific genetic program and for the inactivation of DL- and UL2-specific genes.

AB  - Summary
TRPV1 receptors have classically been defined as heat-sensitive, ligand-gated, nonselective cation channels that integrate nociceptive stimuli in sensory neurons. TRPV1 receptors have also been identified in the brain, but their physiological role is poorly understood. Here we report that TRPV1 channel activation is necessary and sufficient to trigger long-term synaptic depression (LTD). Excitatory synapses onto hippocampal interneurons were depressed by either capsaicin, a potent TRPV1 channel activator, or the endogenously released eicosanoid, 12-(S)-HPETE, whereas neighboring excitatory synapses onto CA1 pyramidal cells were unaffected. TRPV1 receptor antagonists also prevented interneuron LTD. In brain slices from TRPV1−/− mice, LTD was absent, and neither capsaicin nor 12-(S)-HPETE elicited synaptic depression. Our results suggest that, in the hippocampus, TRPV1 receptor activation selectively modifies synapses onto interneurons. Like other forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, TRPV1-mediated LTD may have a role in long-term changes in physiological and pathological circuit behavior during learning and epileptic activity.

AB  - Ever since Hubel and Wiesel described orientation selectivity in the visual cortex, the question of how precise selectivity emerges has been marked by considerable debate. There are essentially two views of how selectivity arises. Feed-forward models rely entirely on the organization of thalamocortical inputs. Feedback models rely on lateral inhibition to refine selectivity relative to a weak bias provided by thalamocortical inputs. The debate is driven by two divergent lines of evidence. On the one hand, many response properties appear to require lateral inhibition, including precise orientation and direction selectivity and crossorientation suppression. On the other hand, intracellular recordings have failed to find consistent evidence for lateral inhibition. Here we demonstrate a resolution to this paradox. Feed-forward models incorporating the intrinsic nonlinear properties of cortical neurons and feed-forward circuits (i.e., spike threshold, contrast saturation, and spike-rate rectification) can account for properties that have previously appeared to require lateral inhibition.

AB  - Summary
The Drosophila phototransduction cascade transforms light into depolarizations that are further shaped by activation of voltage-dependent K+ (Kv) channels. In whole-cell recordings of isolated photoreceptors, we show that light selectively modulated the delayed rectifier (Shab) current. Shab currents were increased by light with similar kinetics to the light-induced current itself (latency ∼20 ms), recovering to control values with a t1/2 of ∼60 s in darkness. Genetic disruption of PLCβ4, responsible for light-induced PIP2 hydrolysis, abolished this light-dependent modulation. In mutants of CDP-diaclyglycerol synthase (cds1), required for PIP2 resynthesis, the modulation became irreversible, but exogenously applied PIP2 restored reversibility. The modulation was accurately and reversibly mimicked by application of PIP2 to heterologously expressed Shab channels in excised inside-out patches. The results indicate a functionally implemented mechanism of Kv channel modulation by PIP2 in photoreceptors, which enables light-dependent regulation of signal processing by direct coupling to the phototransduction cascade.

AB  - Summary
Motoneuron-derived agrin clusters nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in mammalian muscle cells. We used two-hybrid screens to identify a protein, tumorous imaginal discs (Tid1), that binds to the cytoplasmic domain of muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), a major component of the agrin receptor. Like MuSK, Tid1 colocalizes with AChRs at developing, adult, and denervated motor endplates. Knockdown of Tid1 by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in skeletal muscle fibers dispersed synaptic AChR clusters and impaired neuromuscular transmission. In cultured myotubes, Tid1 knockdown inhibited AChR clustering, as well as agrin-induced activation of the Rac and Rho small GTPases and tyrosine phosphorylation of the AChR, without affecting MuSK activation. Tid1 knockdown also decreased Dok-7-induced clustering of AChRs. Overexpression of the N-terminal half of Tid1 induced agrin- and MuSK-independent phosphorylation and clustering of AChRs. These results demonstrate that Tid1 is an essential component of the agrin signaling pathway, crucial for synaptic development.

AB  - Transient elevations in cytoplasmic Ca2+ trigger a multitude of Ca2+-dependent processes in CNS neurons and many other cell types. The specificity, speed, and reliability of these processes is achieved and ensured by tightly restricting Ca2+ signals to very local spatiotemporal domains, “Ca2+ nano- and microdomains,” that are centered around Ca2+-permeable channels. This arrangement requires that the Ca2+-dependent effectors reside within these spatial boundaries where the properties of the Ca2+ domain and the Ca2+ sensor of the effector determine the channel-effector activity. We use Ca2+-activated K+ channels (KCa) with either micromolar (BKCa channels) or submicromolar (SKCa channels) affinity for Ca2+ ions to provide distance constraints for Ca2+-effector coupling in local Ca2+ domains and review their significance for the cell physiology of KCa channels in the CNS. The results may serve as a model for other processes operated by local Ca2+ domains.

AB  - The intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]) has important roles in the triggering of neurotransmitter release and the regulation of short-term plasticity (STP). Transmitter release is initiated by quite high concentrations within microdomains, while short-term facilitation is strongly influenced by the global buildup of “residual calcium.” A global rise in [Ca2+] also accelerates the recruitment of release-ready vesicles, thereby controlling the degree of short-term depression (STD) during sustained activity, as well as the recovery of the vesicle pool in periods of rest. We survey data that lead us to propose two distinct roles of [Ca2+] in vesicle recruitment: one accelerating “molecular priming” (vesicle docking and the buildup of a release machinery), the other promoting the tight coupling between releasable vesicles and Ca2+ channels. Such coupling is essential for rendering vesicles sensitive to short [Ca2+] transients, generated during action potentials.

AB  - One of the unique characteristics of higher organisms is their ability to learn and adapt to changes in their environment. This plasticity is largely a result of the brain's ability to convert transient stimuli into long-lasting alterations in neuronal structure and function. This process is complex and involves changes in receptor trafficking, local mRNA translation, protein turnover, and new gene synthesis. Here, we review how neuronal activity triggers calcium-dependent gene expression to regulate synapse development, maturation, and refinement. Interestingly, many components of the activity-dependent gene expression program are mutated in human cognitive disorders, which suggest that this program is essential for proper brain development and function.

AB  - Summary
NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation can alter synaptic strength by regulating transmitter release from a variety of neurons in the CNS. As NMDARs are permeable to Ca2+ and monovalent cations, they could alter release directly by increasing presynaptic Ca2+ or indirectly by axonal depolarization sufficient to activate voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (VSCCs). Using two-photon microscopy to measure Ca2+ excursions, we found that somatic depolarization or focal activation of dendritic NMDARs elicited small Ca2+ transients in axon varicosities of cerebellar stellate cell interneurons. These axonal transients resulted from Ca2+ entry through VSCCs that were opened by the electrotonic spread of the NMDAR-mediated depolarization elicited in the dendrites. In contrast, we were unable to detect direct activation of NMDARs on axons, indicating an exclusive somatodendritic expression of functional NMDARs. In cerebellar stellate cells, dendritic NMDAR activation masquerades as a presynaptic phenomenon and may influence Ca2+-dependent forms of presynaptic plasticity and release.

AB  - Summary
Perception of the smell of a food precedes its ingestion and perception of its flavor. The neurobiological underpinnings of this association are not well understood. Of central interest is whether the same neural circuits code for anticipatory and consummatory phases. Here, we show that the amygdala and mediodorsal thalamus respond preferentially to food odors that predict immediate arrival of their associated drink (FO+) compared to food odors that predict delivery of a tasteless solution (FO−) and compared to the receipt of the drink. In contrast, the left insula/operculum responds preferentially to the drink, whereas the right insula/operculum and left orbitofrontal cortex respond to FO+ and drink. These findings indicate separable and overlapping representation of anticipatory and consummatory chemosensation. Moreover, since ratings of perceived pleasantness of FO+, FO−, and drink were similar, the response in the amygdala and thalamus cannot reflect acquired affective value but rather predictive meaning or biological relevance.

AB  - Summary
The mesocorticolimbic dopamine system is essential for cognitive and emotive brain functions and is thus an important target in major brain diseases like schizophrenia, drug addiction, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, the cellular basis for the diversity in behavioral functions and associated dopamine-release pattern within the mesocorticolimbic system has remained unclear. Here, we report the identification of a type of dopaminergic neuron within the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system with unconventional fast-firing properties and small DAT/TH mRNA expression ratios that selectively projects to prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens core and medial shell as well as to basolateral amygdala. In contrast, well-described conventional slow-firing dopamine midbrain neurons only project to the lateral shell of the nucleus accumbens and the dorsolateral striatum. Among this dual dopamine midbrain system defined in this study by converging anatomical, electrophysiological, and molecular properties, mesoprefrontal dopaminergic neurons are unique, as only they do not possess functional somatodendritic Girk2-coupled dopamine D2 autoreceptors.
