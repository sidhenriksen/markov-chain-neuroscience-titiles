AB  - Abstract
Gardenamide A (GA) is a stable genipin derivative with neuroprotective properties. It rescued pheochromocytoma cell (PC12) sympathetic cultures and retinal neuronal cells from apoptosis insult induced by serum deprivation. GA attenuated the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Western blotting with specific phospho-antibodies indicated that GA increased the phosphorylation of both the protein kinase B (Akt) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) in PC12 cells. The GA neuroprotective effect was inhibited by either the specific phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 or the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway inhibitor PD98059. These results propose that the neuroprotective effect of GA on PC12 neuronal cell cultures was mediated through both the PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Therefore, GA may serve as a pharmacological tool to investigate neuroprotective mechanisms of neurons afflicted by different insults.

AB  - Abstract
Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter of the retina and affects myopic development. Electroacupuncture (EA) is widely utilized to treat myopia in clinical settings. However, there are few reports on whether EA affects the level of retinal GABA during myopic development. To study this issue, in the present study, we explored the changes of retinal GABA content and the expression of its receptor subtypes, and the effects of EA stimulation on them in a guinea pig model with lens-induced myopia (LIM). Our results showed that the content of GABA and the expression of GABAA and GABAC receptors of retina were up-regulated during the development of myopia, and this up-regulation was inhibited by applying EA to Hegu (LI4) and Taiyang (EX-HN5) acupoints. Moreover, these effects of EA show a positional specificity. While applying EA at a sham acupoint, no apparent change of myopic retinal GABA and its receptor subtypes was observed. Taken together, our findings suggest that LIM is effective to up-regulate the level of retinal GABA, GABAA and GABAC receptors in guinea pigs and the effect may be inhibited by EA stimulation at LI4 and EX-HN5 acupoints.

AB  - Abstract
The present study used event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to investigate audiovisual integration processes in the perception of natural speech in a group of German adult developmental dyslexic readers. Twelve dyslexic and twelve non-dyslexic adults viewed short videos of a male German speaker. Disyllabic German nouns served as stimulus material. The auditory and the visual stimulus streams were segregated to create four conditions: in the congruent condition, the spoken word and the auditory word were identical. In the incongruent condition, the auditory and the visual word (i.e., the lip movements of the utterance) were different. Furthermore, on half of the trials, white noise (45 dB SPL) was superimposed on the auditory trace. Subjects had to say aloud the word they understood after they viewed the video.

Behavioral data. Dyslexic readers committed more errors compared to normal readers in the noise conditions, and this effect was particularly present for congruent trials. ERPs showed a distinct N170 component at temporo-parietal electrodes that was smaller in amplitude for dyslexic readers. Both, normal and dyslexic readers, showed a clear effect of noise at centro-parietal electrodes between 300 and 600 ms. An analysis of error trials reflecting audiovisual integration (verbal responses in the incongruent noise condition that are a mix of the visual and the auditory word) revealed more positive ERPs for dyslexic readers at temporo-parietal electrodes 200–500 ms poststimulus. For normal readers, no such effect was present.

These findings are discussed as reflecting increased effort in dyslexics under circumstances of distorted acoustic input. The superimposition of noise leads dyslexics to rely more on the integration of auditory and visual input (lip reading). Furthermore, the smaller N170-amplitudes indicate deficits in the processing of moving faces in dyslexic adults.

AB  - Abstract
In a previous study, we demonstrated that inflammation suppressed inward rectifying K+ (Kir) currents in satellite glial cells (SGCs) from the trigeminal ganglia (TRGs) and that this impairment of glial potassium homeostasis in the trigeminal ganglion (TRG) contributed to trigeminal pain. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether activation of GABAB receptors modulates the Kir current in SGCs using in vivo patch-clamp and immunohistochemical techniques. Immunohistochemically, we found that immunoreactivity for glial-specific Kir channel subunit Kir4.1 and the GABAB receptor was co-expressed in SGCs from the TRGs. In vivo whole-cell recordings were made using SGCs from the TRGs of urethane-anesthetized rats. Application of baclofen, a GABAB receptor agonist, significantly increased the mean peak amplitude of Kir currents in a concentration-dependent and reversible manner. Baclofen-induced potentiation of the Kir current was abolished by co-application of 3-amino-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyprophylsulfonic acid (saclofen). In addition, baclofen significantly potentiated the density of the Ba2+-sensitive Kir current, and resulted in hyperpolarization of the mean membrane potential. These results suggest that activation of GABAB receptors potentiates the Kir current in SGCs and that GABA released from the TRG neuronal soma could contribute to buffering of extracellular K+ concentrations following excitation of TRG neurons during the processing of sensory information, including the transmission of noxious stimuli.

AB  - Abstract
Inhibitory neurotransmitters, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine, are transported into synaptic vesicles by the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT). Glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) is a GABA-synthesizing enzyme and two isoforms of GAD, GAD65 and GAD67 are encoded by two independent genes. There was virtually no GABA content in GAD65/GAD67 double knockout (GADs DKO) mouse brains. Neither GABAergic nor glycinergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents were almost detected in VGAT knockout (KO) mouse cultured neurons and spinal cords. GAD67 KO and VGAT KO mice displayed developmental abnormalities, cleft palate and omphalocele, suggesting that GABAergic transmission is involved in palate and abdominal wall formations. However, the incidence and severity of both failures in GAD67 KO mice were lower and less than those in VGAT KO mice. These results raise the possibility that GABAergic transmission mediated by GAD65-produced GABA and/or glycinergic transmission contributed to both palate and abdominal wall formations. However, it still remains unclear whether GABAergic transmission mediated by GAD65 and glycinergic transmission contribute to those formations. Here, to answer these questions, we generated GADs DKO mice and compared the phenotypes of GADs DKO mice with those of GAD67 KO and VGAT KO mice. Our anatomical analyses demonstrated that the incidence of cleft palate and omphalocele in GAD67 KO mice was 65.8% and 58.9%, respectively, but the incidence of both phenotypes in GADs DKO and VGAT KO mice was 100%. The severity of cleft palate and omphalocele was evaluated by elevation of palate shelves and size and liver inclusion of omphalocele, respectively. We observed that the phenotypes of cleft palate and omphalocele in GADs DKO mice were more and less severe than those in GAD67 KO and VGAT KO mice, respectively. These results indicate the significant contribution of not only GAD65-mediated GABAergic but also glycinergic transmissions to both palate and abdominal wall formations.

AB  - Abstract
Pudendal nerve-spinal pathways are involved in urethrogenital sensation, pain and sexual activity. However, details of these pathways and their modulation are unclear. We examined spinal pathways activated by the urethrogenital reflex (UGR) and visualized by c-Fos immunoreactivity in reflexly activated neurons within spinal cord. In anesthetized female guinea pigs, a balloon was inserted into the urethra and inflated with short-repeat or long-continuous distension to activate the UGR. A second balloon recorded reflex contractions of the vagina and uterus. Two control groups had either no balloon or a vaginal balloon (VB) only. Ninety minutes after UGR activation, c-Fos immunoreactivity in L3 and S2 spinal segments was examined. Reflex activated c-Fos immunoreactivity also was investigated in some animals with acute spinal transections at either L4 or T12 levels. There was no significant difference in spinal c-Fos expression between the control groups. Short-repeat distension reliably induced a UGR and a two- to threefold increase in c-Fos-expressing neurons throughout dorsal, intermediate and lateral spinal gray matter at S2 and about twofold increase in superficial dorsal horn at L3. T12 transection had little effect on c-Fos expression at either spinal level. However, after L4 transection, UGR generation was associated with a four- to sixfold increase in c-Fos-expressing neurons in lateral horn (LH) and central canal areas at S2, and but only 20–30% increase at L3. Thus, UGR activates preganglionic neurons projecting to pelvic viscera in both sacral and lumbar spinal cord. The reflex also must activate ascending and descending spinal inhibitory circuits that suppress c-Fos-expression in neurons at both sacral and lumbar spinal levels.

AB  - Abstract
Motor coordination is the combination of body movements performed in a well-planned and controlled manner based upon motor commands from the brain. Several interventions have been in practice to improve motor control. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is getting a lot of attention these days for its effect in improving motor functions. Studies focusing on the ability of tDCS to improve motor control, inhibition and coordination are sparse. Therefore, the influence of tDCS stimulation at the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on motor control and coordination was investigated, in a sham-controlled double-blinded pseudo-randomized design, with a multi-limb coordination task in healthy young subjects. Number of errors and reaction time were used as outcome parameters. Our findings showed that, anodal tDCS reduced the number of errors only in the heterolateral coordination condition, however there was no change in reaction time. No changes were found for the homolateral and three-limb coordination conditions.

AB  - Abstract
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major risk factor for stroke and it exacerbates tissue damage after ischemic insult. Diabetes is one of the important causes of the progression of white matter lesion, however, the pathological mechanisms remain unclear. The present study evaluated the influences of type 2 DM on ischemic subcortical white matter injury and the recruitment of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) under chronic cerebral hypoperfusion using type 2 diabetic (db/db) mice. After bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS), the rarefaction in the white matter was more severe in db/db mice than in db/+ mice, and the number of glutathione S-transferase-pi (GST-pi)-positive mature oligodendrocytes (OLG) was lower in db/db mice than in db/+ mice at 4 and 8 weeks after ischemia. There were no significant differences in the number of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-positive apoptotic cells in the deep white matter between the db/db and db/+ mice. We found a transient increase in the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α (PDGFRα)-positive OPCs in white matter lesions after ischemia. However, significantly fewer PDGFRα-positive OPCs were detected in db/db than db/+ mice from 4 weeks after BCAS. The number of Ki67-positive proliferating cells in the deep white matter was significantly lower in db/db mice than in db/+ mice from 4 to 8 weeks after BCAS. Most of the Ki67-positive cells were PDGFRα-positive OPCs. Finally, we assessed the survival of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive proliferating cells in ischemic white matter, and found significantly poorer survival of BrdU/PDGFRα-positive OPCs or BrdU/GST-pi-positive OLGs in the db/db mice compared to the db/+ mice in the white matter after BCAS. Our findings suggest that the type 2 DM mice exhibited more severe white matter injury 8 weeks after chronic ischemia. Decreased proliferation and survival of OPCs may play an important role in the progression of white matter lesions after ischemia in diabetics.

AB  - Abstract
Oxidative stress and the production of reactive oxygen radicals play a key role in neuronal cell damage. This paper describes an in vitro study that explores the neuronal responses to oxidative stress focusing on changes in neuronal excitability and functional membrane properties. This study was carried out in pyramidal cells of the motor cortex by applying whole-cell patch-clamp techniques on brain slices from young adult rats. Oxygen-derived free radical formation was induced by bath application of 10 μM cumene hydroperoxide (CH) for 30 min. CH produced marked changes in the electrophysiological properties of neurons (n = 30). Resting membrane potential became progressively depolarized, as well as depolarization voltage, with no variations in voltage threshold. Membrane resistance showed a biphasic behavior, increasing after 5 min of drug exposure and then it started to decrease, even under control values, after 15 and 30 min. At the same time, changes in membrane resistance produced compensatory variations in the rheobase. The amplitude of the action potentials diminished and the duration increased progressively over time. Some of the neurons under study also lost their ability to discharge action potentials in a repetitive way. Most of the neurons, however, kept their repetitive discharge even though their maximum frequency and gain decreased. Furthermore, cancelation of the repetitive firing discharge took place at intensities that decreased with time of exposure to CH, which resulted in a narrower working range. We can conclude that oxidative stress compromises both neuronal excitability and the capability of generating action potentials, and so this type of neuronal functional failure could precede the neuronal death characteristics of many neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Abstract
The precuneus has received considerable attention in the last decade, because of its cognitive functions, its role as a central node of the brain networks, and its involvement in neurodegenerative processes. Paleoneurological studies suggested that form changes in the deep parietal areas represent a major character associated with the origin of the modern human brain morphology. A recent neuroanatomical survey based on shape analysis suggests that the proportions of the precuneus are also a determinant source of overall brain geometrical differences among adult individuals, influencing the brain spatial organization. Here, we evaluate the variation of cortical thickness and cortical surface area of the precuneus in a sample of adult humans, and their relation with geometry and cognition. Precuneal thickness and surface area are not correlated. There is a marked individual variation. The right precuneus is thinner and larger than the left one, but there are relevant fluctuating asymmetries, with only a modest correlation between the hemispheres. Males have a thicker cortex but differences in cortical area are not significant between sexes. The surface area of the precuneus shows a positive allometry with the brain surface area, although the correlation is modest. The dilation/contraction of the precuneus, described as a major factor of variability within adult humans, is associated with absolute increase/decrease of its surface, but not with variation in thickness. Precuneal thickness, precuneal surface area and precuneal morphology are not correlated with psychological factors such as intelligence, working memory, attention control, and processing speed, stressing further possible roles of this area in supporting default mode functions. Beyond gross morphology, the processes underlying the large phenotypic variation of the precuneus must be further investigated through specific cellular analyses, aimed at considering differences in cellular size, density, composition, and structural covariance compared to other brain areas.

AB  - Abstract
Purpose: Hemodialysis (HD) is considered the most common alternative for overcoming renal failure. Studies have shown the involvement of HD membrane in the genesis of oxidative stress (OS) which has a direct impact on the brain tissue and is expected to be involved in brain plasticity and also reorganization of brain function control. The goal of this paper was to demonstrate the sensitivity of the blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) to characterize the OS before and after the HD session. Patients, materials and methods: Twelve male patient-volunteers following chronic HD for more than 6 months were recruited among 86 HD-patients. All patients underwent identical assessment immediately before and after the full HD-session. This consisted of full biological assessment, including malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant activity (TAOA); and brain BOLD-fMRI using the motor paradigm in block-design. Results: Functional BOLD-fMRI maps of motor area M1 were obtained from the HD patient before and after the hemodialysis session, important decrease in the intensity of brain activation of the motor area after HD, and important increase of the size of the volume of brain activation were observed, these changes are reflecting brain plasticity that is well correlated to OS levels. Individual patients MDA and TAOA before and after the hemodialysis sessions demonstrated a clear and systematic increase of the OS after HD (P-value = 0.03). Correlation of BOLD-fMRI maximal signal intensity and volume of activated cortical brain area behaviors to MDA and total TAOA were close to 1. Conclusion: OS is systematically increased in HD-patients after the HD-process. Indeed, the BOLD-fMRI shows a remarkable sensitivity to brain plasticity studied cortical areas. Our results confirm the superiority of the BOLD-fMRI quantities compared to the biological method used for assessing the OS while not being specific, and reflect the increase in OS generated by the HD. BOLD-fMRI is expected to be a suitable tool for evaluating the plasticity process evolution in hemodialysis brain patients.

AB  - AbstractBackground
Oral contraceptives (OCs) affect mood in some women and may have more subtle effects on emotional information processing in many more users. Female carriers of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) haplotype 2 have been shown to be more optimistic and less vulnerable to depression.
Aim
To investigate the effects of oral contraceptives on emotional information processing and a possible moderating effect of MR haplotype.
Methods
Cross-sectional study in 85 healthy premenopausal women of West-European descent.
Results
We found significant main effects of oral contraceptives on facial expression recognition, emotional memory and decision-making. Furthermore, carriers of MR haplotype 1 or 3 were sensitive to the impact of OCs on the recognition of sad and fearful faces and on emotional memory, whereas MR haplotype 2 carriers were not.
Limitations
Different compounds of OCs were included. No hormonal measures were taken. Most naturally cycling participants were assessed in the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle.
Conclusions
Carriers of MR haplotype 2 may be less sensitive to depressogenic side-effects of OCs.

AB  - Abstract
The present research explored the cortical correlates of emotional memories in response to words and pictures. Subjects’ performance (Accuracy Index, AI; response times, RTs; RTs/AI) was considered when a repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) was applied on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (LDLPFC). Specifically, the role of LDLPFC was tested by performing a memory task, in which old (previously encoded targets) and new (previously not encoded distractors) emotional pictures/words had to be recognized. Valence (positive vs. negative) and arousing power (high vs. low) of stimuli were also modulated. Moreover, subjective evaluation of emotional stimuli in terms of valence/arousal was explored. We found significant performance improving (higher AI, reduced RTs, improved general performance) in response to rTMS. This “better recognition effect” was only related to specific emotional features, that is positive high arousal pictures or words. Moreover no significant differences were found between stimulus categories. A direct relationship was also observed between subjective evaluation of emotional cues and memory performance when rTMS was applied to LDLPFC. Supported by valence and approach model of emotions, we supposed that a left lateralized prefrontal system may induce a better recognition of positive high arousal words, and that evaluation of emotional cue is related to prefrontal activation, affecting the recognition memories of emotions.

AB  - Abstract
During the past decade, one of the most striking discoveries in the treatment of major depression was the clinical finding that a single infusion of a sub-anesthetic dose of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine produces a rapid (i.e. within a few hours) and long-lasting (i.e. up to two weeks) antidepressant effect in both treatment-resistant depressed patients and in animal models of depression. Notably, converging clinical and preclinical evidence support that responsiveness to antidepressant drugs is sex-differentiated. Strikingly, research regarding the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine has focused almost exclusively on the male sex. Herein we report that female C57BL/6J stress-naïve mice are more sensitive to the rapid and the sustained antidepressant-like effects of ketamine in the forced swim test (FST). In particular, female mice responded to lower doses of ketamine (i.e. 3 mg/kg at 30 min and 5 mg/kg at 24 h post-injection), doses that were not effective in their male counterparts. Moreover, tissue levels of the excitatory amino acids glutamate and aspartate, as well as serotonergic activity, were affected in a sex-dependent manner in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, at the same time-points. Most importantly, a single injection of ketamine (10 mg/kg) induced sex-dependent behavioral effects in mice subjected to the chronic mild stress (CMS) model of depression. Intriguingly, female mice were more reactive to the earlier effects of ketamine, as assessed in the open field and the FST (at 30 min and 24 h post-treatment, respectively) but the antidepressant potential of the drug proved to be longer lasting in males, as assessed in the splash test and the FST (days 5 and 7 post-treatment, respectively). Taken together, present data revealed that ketamine treatment induces sex-dependent rapid and sustained neurochemical and behavioral antidepressant-like effects in stress-naïve and CMS-exposed C57BL/6J mice.

AB  - Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder and current therapies help alleviate symptoms, but are not disease modifying. In the flavonoid class of compounds, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) has been reported to elicit tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB) dimerization and autophosphorylation that further stimulates signaling cascades to promote cell survival/growth, differentiation, and plasticity. In this study we investigated if 7,8-DHF could prevent further loss of dopaminergic cells and terminals if introduced at the midpoint (i.e. intervention) of our progressive mouse model of PD. In our model, 1-methyl-4phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahyrdopyridine (MPTP) is administered with increased doses each week (8, 16, 24, 32-kg/mg) over a 4-week period. We found that despite 4 weeks of MPTP treatment, animals administered 7,8-DHF starting at the 2-week time period maintained 54% of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels within the dorsolateral (DL) striatum compared to the vehicle group, which was comparable to animals treated with MPTP for 2 weeks and was significantly greater compared to animals treated with MPTP for the full 4 weeks. Animals treated with MPTP and 7,8-DHF also demonstrated increased levels of, a sprouting-associated protein, superior cervical ganglion-10 (SCG10), phosphorylated TrkB (pTrkB), and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (pERK1/2) within the DL striatum and substantia nigra (SN) compared to the 4-week MPTP-treated animals. In addition, motor deficits seen in the 2- and 4-week MPTP-treated animals were restored following administration of 7,8-DHF. We are reporting here for the first time that intervention with 7,8-DHF blocks further loss of dopaminergic terminals and restores motor deficits in our progressive MPTP mouse model. Our data suggest that 7,8-DHF has the potential to be a translational therapy in PD.

AB  - Abstract
Both central and peripheral sympathetic nervous systems contribute to the cardiovascular effects of dexmedetomidine (DMED), a highly selective and widely used a2-adrenoceptor agonist for sedation, analgesia, and stress management. The central sympatholytic effects are augmented by peripheral inhibition of sympathetic ganglion transmission. The mechanism is not clear. In this research, using conventional patch-clamp recordings we investigated the direct effects of DMED on sodium (Na+) channel currents (INa) and nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (nAChRs) channel currents (IACh) in rat superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons to explore the possible mechanisms of sympathetic ganglion transmission inhibition by DMED. DMED voltage-dependently suppressed INa with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 67.2 ± 9.6 μM and 26.1 ± 5.3 μM at holding potentials of −80 mV and −60 mV, respectively. The inhibition of Na+ channels by DMED was also frequency dependent. 100 μM DMED shifted the Na+ channel inactivation curves to the hyperpolarizing direction by 9.8 mV (P &lt; 0.01) and slowed the recovery from inactivation by 8.9 ms (P &lt; 0.01), but no effects were seen on the shape of the current–voltage relationship or Na+ channels activation curves. DMED dose-dependently inhibited IACh with an IC50 value of 5.5 ± 2.4 μM in SCG neurons, and this inhibition was voltage-independent. DMED pretreatment followed by fast co-application of DMED and ACh produced a significantly larger IACh inhibition than without DMED pretreatment. Yohimbine, phentolamine, and atropine pretreatment did not alter the inhibitory effects of DMED on INa and IACh.

In conclusion, DMED dose-dependently inhibits INa and IACh in rat SCG neurons by preferential binding to the inactivated state of the Na+ channels and the closed state (resting) of nAChR channels respectively. Both inhibitions are a2-adrenoceptor independent. Furthermore, the nAChR channels in rat SCG neurons are much more sensitive to inhibition by DMED than Na+ channels.

AB  - Abstract
Polypeptides produced in the gastrointestinal tract, stomach, adipocytes, pancreas and brain that influence food intake are referred to as ‘feeding-related’ peptides. Most peptides that influence feeding exert an inhibitory effect (anorexigenic peptides). In contrast, only a few exert a stimulating effect (orexigenic peptides), such as ghrelin. Homeostatic feeding refers to when food consumed matches energy deficits. However, in western society where access to palatable energy-dense food is nearly unlimited, food is mostly consumed for non-homeostatic reasons. Emerging evidence implicates the mesocorticolimbic circuitry, including dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA), as a key substrate for non-homeostatic feeding. VTA dopamine neurons encode cues that predict rewards and phasic release of dopamine in the ventral striatum motivates animals to forage for food. To elucidate how feeding-related peptides regulate reward pathways is of importance to reveal the mechanisms underlying non-homeostatic or hedonic feeding. Here, we review the current knowledge of how anorexigenic peptides and orexigenic peptides act within the VTA.

AB  - Abstract
Rats with dopamine depletion caused by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) treatment during adulthood and the neonatal period exhibit akinetic motor activity and spontaneous motor hyperactivity during adolescence, respectively, indicating that the behavioral effects of dopamine depletion depend on the period of lesion development. Dopamine depletion during adulthood induces hyperalgesic response to mechanical, thermal, and/or chemical stimuli, whereas the effects of neonatal dopamine depletion on nociceptive response in adolescent rats are yet to be examined. The latter aspect was addressed in this study, and behavioral responses were examined using von-Frey, tail flick, and formalin tests. The formalin test revealed that rats with neonatal dopamine depletion exhibited a significant increase in nociceptive response during interphase (6–15 min post formalin injection) and phase 2 (16–75 min post formalin injection). This increase in nociceptive response to the formalin injection was not reversed by pretreatment with methamphetamine, which ameliorates motor hyperactivity observed in adolescent rats with neonatal 6-OHDA treatment. The von-Frey filament and tail flick tests failed to reveal significant differences in withdrawal thresholds between neonatal 6-OHDA-treated and vehicle-treated rats. The spinal neuronal response to the formalin injection into the rat hind paw was also examined through immunohistochemical analysis of c-Fos protein. Significantly increased numbers of c-Fos-immunoreactive cells were observed in laminae I–II and V–VI of the ipsilateral spinal cord to the site of the formalin injection in rats with neonatal dopamine depletion compared with vehicle-treated rats. These results suggest that the dopaminergic neural system plays a crucial role in the development of a neural network for tonic pain, including the spinal neural circuit for nociceptive transmission, and that the mechanism underlying hyperalgesia to tonic pain is not always consistent with that of spontaneous motor hyperactivity induced by neonatal dopamine depletion.

AB  - Abstract
The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-producing neurons of the amygdala have been implicated in behavioral and physiological responses associated with fear, anxiety, stress, food intake and reward. To overcome the difficulties in identifying CRF neurons within the amygdala, a novel transgenic mouse line, in which the humanized recombinant Renilla reniformis green fluorescent protein (hrGFP) is under the control of the CRF promoter (CRF-hrGFP mice), was developed. First, the CRF-hrGFP mouse model was validated and the localization of CRF neurons within the amygdala was systematically mapped. Amygdalar hrGFP-expressing neurons were located primarily in the interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure, but also present in the central amygdala. Secondly, the marker of neuronal activation c-Fos was used to explore the response of amygdalar CRF neurons in CRF-hrGFP mice under different experimental paradigms. C-Fos induction was observed in CRF neurons of CRF-hrGFP mice exposed to an acute social defeat stress event, a fasting/refeeding paradigm or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. In contrast, no c-Fos induction was detected in CRF neurons of CRF-hrGFP mice exposed to restraint stress, forced swimming test, 48-h fasting, acute high-fat diet (HFD) consumption, intermittent HFD consumption, ad libitum HFD consumption, HFD withdrawal, conditioned HFD aversion, ghrelin administration or melanocortin 4 receptor agonist administration. Thus, this study fully characterizes the distribution of amygdala CRF neurons in mice and suggests that they are involved in some, but not all, stress or food intake-related behaviors recruiting the amygdala.

Olfactory event-related potentials (OERPs) are widely used to study central odor processing. Only a few studies used this method in children and adolescents. Aim of the current study therefore was to measure OERP and the possible influences of age and sex on central odor processing in this age group.
Methods
A total of 81 children between 6 and 17 years of age were included in this study. OERP in response to a rose-like odor were measured from three recording positions (Fz, Cz, Pz) according to the 10–20 system. Stimuli were presented by means of a computer-controlled olfactometer.
Results
Age had a significant influence on the amplitudes of the late positivity with younger children showing larger amplitudes. Although age did not significantly affect the latencies of OERP, interactions of recording positions and latencies between younger and older children and between girls and boys were found.
Conclusions
OERP can be used to study central odor processing in children older than 6 years of age. Central odor processing changes from childhood to adolescents possibly reflecting maturation of the brain.

AB  - Abstract
Mice do not require the brain in order to maintain constricted pupils. However, little is known about this intrinsic pupillary light reflex (iPLR) beyond a requirement for melanopsin in the iris and an intact retinal ciliary marginal zone (CMZ). Here, we study the mouse iPLR in vitro and examine a potential role for outer retina (rods and cones) in this response. In wild-type mice the iPLR was absent at postnatal day 17 (P17), developing progressively from P21–P49. However, the iPLR only achieved ∼30% of the wild-type constriction in adult mice with severe outer retinal degeneration (rd and rdcl). Paradoxically, the iPLR increased significantly in retinal degenerate mice &gt;1.5 years of age. This was accompanied by an increase in baseline pupil tone in the dark to levels indistinguishable from those in adult wild types. This rejuvenated iPLR response was slowed by atropine application, suggesting the involvement of cholinergic neurotransmission. We could find no evidence of an increase in melanopsin expression by quantitative PCR in the iris and ciliary body of aged retinal degenerates and a detailed anatomical analysis revealed a significant decline in melanopsin-positive intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) in rdcl mice &gt;1.5 years. Adult mice lacking rod function (Gnat1−/−) also had a weak iPLR, while mice lacking functional cones (Cpfl5) maintained a robust response. We also identify an important role for pigmentation in the development of the mouse iPLR, with only a weak and transient response present in albino animals. Our results show that the iPLR in mice develops unexpectedly late and are consistent with a role for rods and pigmentation in the development of this response in mice. The enhancement of the iPLR in aged degenerate mice was extremely surprising but may have relevance to behavioral observations in mice and patients with retinitis pigmentosa.

AB  - Abstract
Gonadectomy in adult male rats significantly impairs spatial working memory, behavioral flexibility and other functions associated with the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, the mechanisms through which this occurs are largely unknown. In this study, intracortical drug challenge with the selective N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist D(−)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV) was combined with Barnes maze testing, gonadectomy (GDX) and hormone replacement (17β-estradiol, testosterone propionate) to explore the contributions of NMDAR-mediated activity within the PFC to hormone effects on spatial cognition in adult male rats. Previous studies have shown that Barnes maze testing reveals significant estrogen-dependent, GDX-induced deficits in spatial working memory and androgen-sensitive, GDX-induced deficits in spatial search strategy. Here we found that bilateral infusion of APV into the medial PFC prior to testing significantly improved both sets of behaviors in gonadectomized rats and significantly worsened performance measures in gonadally intact controls. In hormone-replaced cohorts, we further found that behaviors that are normally similar to controls were significantly disrupted by APV, and those that are normally similar to gonadectomized rats were rescued by intracortical APV infusion. There were, however, no residual effects of APV on retention testing conducted 24 h later. Together these findings suggest that hormone regulation of NMDAR-mediated activity specifically within the PFC may be fundamental to the effects of gonadal steroids on spatial cognition in males. Our findings further identify NMDAR antagonists as potentially novel, non-steroidal means of attenuating the cognitive deficits that can accompany gonadal hormone decline in human males in aging, clinical cases of hypogonadalism and in certain neurologic and psychiatric illnesses. Accordingly, it may be important to obtain in males the kind of detailed knowledge concerning hormone effects on, for example, the channel and electrophysiological properties of NMDAR that currently exists for the female brain.

AB  - Abstract
The same clock-genes, including Period (PER) 1 and 2, that show rhythmic expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) are also rhythmically expressed in other brain regions that serve as extra-SCN oscillators. Outside the hypothalamus, the phase of these extra-SCN oscillators appears to be reversed when diurnal and nocturnal mammals are compared. Based on mRNA data, PER1 protein is expected to peak in the late night in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) of nocturnal laboratory rats, but comparable data are not available for a diurnal species. Here we use the diurnal grass rat (Arvicanthis niloticus) to describe rhythms of PER1 and 2 proteins in the PVN of animals that either show the species-typical day-active (DA) profile, or that adopt a night-active (NA) profile when given access to running wheels. For DA animals housed with or without wheels, significant rhythms of PER1 or PER2 protein expression featured peaks in the late morning; NA animals showed patterns similar to those expected from nocturnal laboratory rats. Since the PVN is part of the circuit that controls pineal rhythms, we also measured circulating levels of melatonin during the day and night in DA animals with and without wheels and in NA wheel runners. All three groups showed elevated levels of melatonin at night, with higher levels during both the day and night being associated with the levels of activity displayed by each group. The differential phase of rhythms in the clock-gene protein in the PVN of diurnal and nocturnal animals presents a possible mechanism for explaining species differences in the phase of autonomic rhythms controlled, in part, by the PVN. The present study suggests that the phase of the oscillator of the PVN does not determine that of the melatonin rhythm in diurnal and nocturnal species or in diurnal and nocturnal chronotypes within a species.

AB  - AbstractRationale
Recent clinical studies suggest GABA-ergic system abnormalities as a neuropathological mechanism of schizophrenia.
Objectives
In the present study, we examined the effect of chronic prenatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration on immunohistochemical changes of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD67) and parvalbumin (PV)-expressing neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of rats.
Results
These data demonstrated that prenatal LPS administration during the final 2 weeks of pregnancy induced schizophrenia-like behavioral symptoms, such as deficits in sensorimotor gating (prepulse inhibition) and impairments in social interactions and exploration, in adult offspring. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that in our neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia, decreases in the total number of PV- and GAD67-positive neurons in the medial prefrontal cortices of adult females prenatally exposed to LPS were observed, whereas these immunochemical changes were primarily detected in the hippocampus of males. Additionally, a decrease in PV-labeled axon terminals of GABA-ergic cells, likely reflecting the perisomatic inhibitory innervation of pyramidal neurons, was observed in the medial prefrontal cortices in both sexes.
Conclusion
This study provided evidence of a key role for the GABA system in neurodevelopment associated with the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia and showed that the observed changes are sex-dependent. Moreover, this study is the first to present a model of schizophrenia based on prenatal LPS administration, which not only produced behavioral abnormalities but also changed the cytoarchitecture of the GABA inhibitory system.

AB  - Abstract
Our working hypothesis is that brain neurotrophins and brain Na+,K+-ATPase may be strongly associated with the occurrence of depression in animals subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Still, we believe that chrysin, a natural and bioactive flavonoid found in honey and some plants, can provide satisfactory effects on antidepressant therapy. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the effect of CUMS on brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) levels as well as the Na+,K+-ATPase activity in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of female mice. We also aimed to examine the effect of a 28-day oral treatment with chrysin (5 or 20 mg/kg) in female mice subjected to CUMS, comparing to the effect of fluoxetine. Results showed that CUMS applied for 28 days induced a decrease in BDNF and NGF levels as well as in the Na+,K+-ATPase activity. CUMS also promoted a depressive status in the swimming forced test (FST), in the sucrose preference test, and in corticosterone levels. Chrysin (20 mg/kg) and fluoxetine also occasioned the up-regulation of BDNF and NGF levels in non-stressed mice and in mice subjected to CUMS. CUMS decreased non-protein thiol (NPSH) levels and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. In response to these changes, the glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) activities were increased in mice exposed to CUMS. Chrysin and fluoxetine treatments protected against all these alterations, suggesting the involvement of the antioxidant function in the antidepressant effect of chrysin and fluoxetine. In conclusion, CUMS decreased BDNF and NGF levels as well as the Na+,K+-ATPase activity in mice. Chrysin presented antidepressant effect in mice on behavioral, neurotrophic and biochemistry parameters equivalent to fluoxetine. Furthermore, we suggest that the up-regulation of BDNF and NGF levels is a mechanism possibly involved in the antidepressant effect of chrysin in mice.

The present study examines the change in water diffusion properties of the corpus callosum (CC) and the hippocampus, in response to prolonged hypobaric hypoxia (HH) stress, using in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities such as T2 relaxometry and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Three groups of rats (n = 7/group) were exposed to a simulated altitude of 6700 m above sea level for the duration of 7, 14 and 21 days, respectively. Data were acquired pre-exposure, post-exposure and after 1 week of normoxic follow-up in each group. The increment in T2 values with no apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) change in the CC after 7 and 14 days of HH exposure indicated mixed (vasogenic and cytotoxic) edema formation. After 1 week of normoxia, 7-day HH-exposed rats showed a decrease in ADC values in the CC, probably due to cytotoxic edema. A delayed decrease in ADC values was observed in the hippocampus after 1 week normoxic follow-up in 7- and 14-day HH groups giving an insight of cytotoxic edema formation. Interestingly, 21-day HH-exposed rats did not show change in ADC values. The decrease in T2 values after 14 and 21 days in the hippocampal region depicts iron deposition, which was confirmed by histopathology. This study successfully demonstrated the use of MRI modality to trace water diffusion changes in the brain due to prolonged HH exposure.

AB  - Abstract
Recent studies of electromagnetic ultra-slow waves (⩽0.1 Hz) have suggested that they play a role in the integration of otherwise disassociated brain regions supporting vital functions (Ackermann and Borbely, 1997; Picchioni et al., 2010; Knyazev, 2012; Le Bon et al., 2012). We emphasize this spectral domain in probing sensor coherence issues raised by these studies using Hilbert phase coherences in the human MEG. In addition, we ask: will temporal–spatial phase coherence in regional brain oscillations obtained from the ultraslow spectral bands of multi-channel magnetoencephalograms (MEG) differentiate resting, “task-free” MEG records of normal control and schizophrenic subjects? The goal of the study is a comparison of the relative persistence of intra-regional phase locking values (PLVs), among 10, region-defined, sensors in examined in the resting multichannel, MEG records as a function of spectral frequency bands and diagnostic category. The following comparison of Hilbert-transform-engendered relative phases of each designated spectral band was made using their pair-wise PLVs. This indicated the proportion of shared cycle time in which the phase relations between the index location and reference leads were maintained. Leave one out, bootstrapping of the PLVs via a support vector machine (SVM), classified clinical status with 97.3% accuracy. It was generally the case that spectral bands ⩽1.0 Hz generated the highest values of the PLVs and discriminated best between control and patient populations. We conclude that PLV analysis of the oscillatory patterns of MEG recordings in the ultraslow frequency bands suggest their functional significance in intra-regional signal coherence and provide a higher rate of classification of patients and normal subjects than the other spectral domains examined.

AB  - Abstract
Two major neurotrophic factors, nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are involved in a number of physiological processes associated with neuronal growth, survival and plasticity. There are an increasing number of papers demonstrating their ability to serve as neuroprotective molecules under various pathological conditions. At the same time, it remains unclear whether both NGF and BDNF have similar roles under pathological conditions and their effects on the electrophysiological properties of neurons after acute pathogen exposure. In the present paper we investigated the neuroprotective role of these two neurotrophins in a well-characterized model of beta-amyloid peptide (Aβ)-dependent impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP). Using lentiviral gene delivery we performed long-term elevation of neurotrophin expression in the dentate gyrus (DG) of rats. One week after virus injection acute brain slices were incubated with beta-amyloid (25–35) for 1 h and afterward in vitro LTP induction was performed in medial perforant path–DG synapses. We demonstrate that chronic elevation of NGF but not BDNF concentration protects LTP induction from beta-amyloid action. Further inhibitory analysis suggests that the effect of NGF is mediated by PI3K-signaling cascade.

AB  - Abstract
Neuroactive steroids, like allopregnanolone (A) and pregnanolone (P), bind to specifics sites on the GABAA receptor complex and modulate receptor function. They are capable to inhibit or stimulate the binding of GABAA receptor-specific ligands, like t-butyl-bicyclophosphorothionate, flunitrazepam and muscimol. We have previously characterized a set of oxygen-bridged synthetic steroids (SS) analogs to A or P using synaptosomes. Considering that the subunit composition of the GABAA receptor throughout the central nervous system affects the magnitude of the modulation of the GABAA receptor by NAS, we evaluated the action of two selected SS, in brain sections containing the cerebral cortex (CC) and hippocampus (HC) using quantitative receptor autoradiography. Both SS affected the binding of the three ligands in a similar way to A and P, with some differences on certain CC layers according to the ligand used. One of the SS, the 3α-hydroxy-6,19-epoxypregn-4-ene-20-one (compound 5), behaved similarly to the natural neuroactive steroids. However, significant differences with compound 5 were observed on the HC CA2 region, making it steroid suitable for a specific action. Those differences may be related to structural conformation of the SS and the subunits’ composition present on the receptor complex.

AB  - Abstract
Previously, we demonstrated that group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) reduce glutamate release from thalamocortical synapses during early postnatal development (P7–11). To further examine the role of group II mGluRs in the modulation of somatosensory circuitry, we determined whether group II mGluRs continue to modulate thalamocortical synapses until adulthood and whether these receptors also modulate intra-cortical synapses in the barrel cortex. To address these issues, we examined the effect of the group II mGluR agonists on thalamocortical excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and intra-barrel EPSCs in slices from animals of different ages (P7–53). We found that the depression of thalamocortical EPSCs by group II mGluRs rapidly declined after the second postnatal week. In contrast, adenosine continued to depress thalamocortical EPSCs via a presynaptic mechanism in young adult mice (P30–50). Activation of group II mGluRs also reduced intra-barrel EPSCs through a postsynaptic mechanism in young mice (P7–11). Similar to the thalamocortical synapses, the group II mGluR modulation of intra-barrel excitatory synapses declined with development. In young adult animals (P30–50), group II mGluR stimulation had little effect on intra-barrel EPSCs but did hyperpolarize the neurons. Together our results demonstrate that group II mGluRs modulate barrel cortex circuitry by presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms depending on the source of the synapse and that this modulation declines with development.

AB  - Abstract
Growing evidence suggests that glial cells express virtually all known types of neurotransmitter receptors, enabling them to sense neuronal activity and microenvironment changes by responding locally via the Ca2+-dependent release of bioactive molecules, known as “gliotransmitters”. Several mechanisms of gliotransmitter release have been documented. One of these mechanisms involves the opening of plasma membrane channels, known as hemichannels. These channels are composed of six protein subunits consisting of connexins or pannexins, two highly conserved protein families encoded by 21 or 3 genes, respectively, in humans. Most data indicate that under physiological conditions, glial cell hemichannels have low activity, but this activity is sufficient to ensure the release of relevant quantities of gliotransmitters to the extracellular milieu, including ATP, glutamate, adenosine and glutathione. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that dysregulations of hemichannel properties could be critical in the beginning and during the maintenance of homeostatic imbalances observed in several brain diseases. In this study, we review the current knowledge on the hemichannel-dependent release of gliotransmitters in the physiology and pathophysiology of the CNS.

AB  - Abstract
The endogenous tetrapeptide endomorphin-2 (EM2) participates in pain modulation by binding to pre- and/or post-synaptic μ opioid receptor (MOR). In the present study, pathological expression and antinociceptive effects of EM2 at the spinal level were investigated in a rat model of bone cancer pain. The model was established by introducing Walker 256 mammary gland carcinoma cells into the tibia medullary cavity. Immunohistochemical staining for EM2 showed a markedly reduced EM2-immunoreactivity in the ipsilateral spinal dorsal horn on days 6, 12 and 18 post Walker 256 inoculation (p &lt; 0.05). Intrathecal injection (i.t.) of EM2 significantly attenuated cancer-induced mechanical allodynia (p &lt; 0.05) which could be blocked by β-funaltrexamine (β-FNA), the μ receptor antagonist (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, topical application of EM2 dose-dependently inhibited the electrically evoked C-fiber responses and postdischarge of wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons within the spinal cord (p &lt; 0.05), and pretreatment with β-FNA abolished the hyperactivity of these neurons. Compared with the antinociception of morphine which took effect from 40 min to 100 min post application, the analgesic action of EM2 was characterized by quick onset and short-lived efficacy (p &lt; 0.05), being most potent at 10 min and lasting about 20 min. These findings indicate that the down-regulated spinal EM2 is an important contributor to the neuropathological process of bone cancer pain and enhancing activation of EM2/μ receptor signaling might provide a therapeutic alternative to optimizing the treatment of cancer-induced bone pain.

Tormentic acid (TA) has been reported to have anticancer, anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic properties. However, the effects of TA on neuroinflammation have not been reported. In this study, we investigated whether TA inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response in BV2 microglia cells. BV2 microglia cells were treated with TA for 1 h before exposure to LPS. The expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and liver X receptor alpha (LXRα) was detected by western blotting. The expression of cytokines Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 1beta (IL-1β) was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Results showed that TA inhibited nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production by inhibiting iNOS and COX-2 expression. TA also inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β expression. Furthermore, TA could activate LXRα and inhibit LPS-induced NF-κB activation. Knowdown of LXRα reversed the anti-inflammatory effects of TA. In conclusion, our results indicate that TA exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on LPS-stimulated BV2 microglia cells by activating LXRα.

AB  - Abstract
The significance of Na/K-ATPase on respiratory rhythm generation is not well understood. We investigated the effects of the Na/K-ATPase blocker, ouabain, on respiratory rhythm. Experiments were performed with brainstem-spinal cord preparation from 0 to 3-day-old Wistar rats and with decerebrate and arterially perfused in situ preparation from juvenile rats (postnatal day 11–13). Newborn rat preparations were superfused at a rate of 3.0 ml/min with artificial cerebrospinal fluid, equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, pH 7.4, at 26–27 °C. Inspiratory activity was monitored from the fourth cervical ventral root (C4). Application of ouabain (15–20 min) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the burst rate of C4 inspiratory activity. After washout, the burst rate further increased to reach quasi-maximum values under each condition (e.g. 183% of control in 1 μM, 253% in 10 μM, and 303% in 20 μM at 30 min washout). Inspiratory or pre-inspiratory neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla were depolarized. We obtained similar results (i.e. increased phrenic burst rate) in an in situ perfused preparation of juvenile rats. Genes encoding the Na/K-ATPase α subunit were expressed in the region of the parafacial respiratory group (pFRG) in neonatal rats, suggesting that cells (neurons and/or glias) in the pFRG were one of the targets of ouabain. We concluded that Na/K-ATPase activity could be an important factor in respiratory rhythm modulation.

AB  - Abstract
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are neurodegenerative diseases that overlap clinically, genetically, and pathologically. Dysregulation of fused in sarcoma (FUS) has been hypothesized to cause ALS and FTLD in gain-of-function and/or loss-of-function manners. However, the link between the pathogenesis of ALS/FTLD and dysfunction of FUS has not been clearly determined. In this study, we found that overexpression of FUS, but not knocking-down of endogenous FUS expression, induces death in motor neuronal NSC34 cells and primary cortical neurons via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, possibly independently of transactive response DNA-binding protein-43. Furthermore, we found that nuclear FUS, but not cytoplasmic FUS, is responsible for FUS-induced neuronal cell death. These observations suggest that the gain-of-function of FUS in the nucleus contributes to the pathogenesis of FUS-linked neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Abstract
Early degeneration of pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) is considered part of changes that characterize premotor stages of Parkinson’s disease (PD). In this paper, the effects of unilateral neurotoxic lesion of the PPN in motor execution and in the development of oxidative stress events in striatal and nigral tissues in rats were evaluated. The motor performance was assessed using the beam test (BT) and the cylinder test (CT). Nigral and striatal redox balance, was studied by means of biochemical indicators such as malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) and the catalase enzymatic activity (CAT EA). Lesioned rats showed fine motor dysfunction expressed both as an increase in the length (p &lt; 0.001) and deviation (p &lt; 0.001) of the traveled path and also in the time spent (p &lt; 0.01) in the circular small beam (CBS) (p &lt; 0.01) in comparison with control groups. In addition, the lesioned rats group presented a right asymmetry index greater than 0.5 which is consistent with a significant increase in the percentage of use of the right forelimb (ipsilateral to the lesion), compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Biochemical studies revealed that after 48-h PPN neurotoxic injury, the CAT EA showed a significant increase in the subtantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) (p &lt; 0.05). This significant increase of CAT EA persisted in the nigral tissue (p &lt; 0.001) and reached the striatal tissue (p &lt; 0.001) seven days after PPN injury. Also at seven days post-injury PPN, increased concentrations of MDA (p &lt; 0.01) and a tendency to decrease in the concentrations of NO in both structures (SNpc and striatum) were found. The events associated with the generation of free radicals at nigral and striatal levels, can be part of the physiological mechanisms underlying motor dysfunction in rats with unilateral PPN neurotoxic lesion.

AB  - Abstract
Although the neural correlates that underlie abdominal pain have been investigated, so-called brain processes involved in modulating “gut feelings” remain unclear. In the current study, we used electrointestinography (EIG) to measure intestinal activity of healthy humans at rest. EIG measured myoelectrical activity of intestinal smooth muscles from the abdominal surface and was simultaneously conducted along with brain activity measurement using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Correlations between the frequency powers of EIG and fMRI signals during 30 min of rest were then examined to elucidate gut–brain interactions. Neural activity correlating with 0.14- to 0.21-Hz EIG (suggested to reflect intestinal activity) was observed in the right anterior and middle insula. Moreover, this EIG frequency band correlated with anxiety scores along with resting-state functional connectivity between the insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. These findings suggest that the insular cortex could be the core region involved in central visceral processes associated with subjective feelings.

AB  - Abstract
We have analyzed the expression pattern of a novel serine/threonine kinase gene Ulk4 during forebrain development in Xenopus laevis. To this aim, we firstly cloned a Ulk4 cDNA fragment from X. laevis and generated a RNA probe that was used for its detection by in situ hybridization. Throughout development xUlk4 expression was detected along the ventricular (vz) and subventricular zones (svz) of all forebrain regions, with the exception of the vz of the striatum. In the adult, xUlk4 was also mainly located in the vz, with some xUlk4 expressing cells reaching the svz/mantle zone (mz). This xUlk4 expression was especially remarkable in forebrain regions involving the homeostatic control of the brain such as the preoptic region, the hypothalamic territory and some neurosecretory circumventricular organs (CVOs). We further combined in situ hybridization for xUlk4 with immunohistochemistry for the neural progenitor cell marker SOX3, the radial glial marker brain lipid-binding protein (BLBP), neuronal markers MAP2 and doublecortin (DCX) and the specific neuronal marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). xUlk4 was co-expressed with the neural stem/progenitor cell marker SOX3 in the vz of all the forebrain regions throughout development and in the adult, and this co-expression was also especially evident in the svz of the hypothalamic region. xUlk4 was also expressed in the radial glia along the whole brain. We have also found minor expression of xUlk4 in some DCX- or MAP2-positive cells but not in TH-positive neurons. These findings suggest that Ulk4 may play roles in neural stem/progenitor cells during neurogenesis both in development and in the adulthood, in migrating cells as well as in cells committed to neuronal fate in Xenopus. Moreover, the results obtained in this study argue for an involvement of Ulk4 in the control of the neuroendocrine homeostatic functions in the brain.

AB  - Abstract
Orbitofrontal reality filtering (ORF) denotes a little known but vital memory control mechanism, expressed at 200–300 ms after stimulus presentation, that allows one to sense whether evoked memories (thoughts) refer to present reality and can be acted upon, or not. Its failure induces reality confusion evident in confabulations that patients act upon and disorientation. In what way ORF differs from temporal order judgment (TOJ), that is, the conscious knowledge about when something happened in the past, has never been explored. Here we used evoked potential analysis to compare ORF and TOJ within a combined experimental task and within a comparable time frame, close to the experienced present. Seventeen healthy human subjects performed an experiment using continuous recognition tasks that combined the challenges of ORF and TOJ. We found that the two mechanisms dissociated behaviorally: subjects were markedly slower and less accurate in TOJ than ORF. Both mechanisms evoked similar potentials at 240–280 ms, when ORF normally occurs. However, they rapidly dissociated in terms of amplitude differences and electrical source from 310 to 360 ms and again from 530 to 560 ms. We conclude that the task of consciously ordering memories in the immediate past (TOJ) is effortful and slow in contrast to sensing memories’ relation with the present (ORF). Both functions invoke similar early electrocortical processes which then rapidly dissociate and engage different brain areas. The results are consistent with the different consequences of the two mechanisms’ dysfunction: while failure of ORF has a known clinical manifestation (reality confusion as evident in confabulation and disorientation), the failure of TOJ, as tested here, has no such known clinical correlate.

AB  - Abstract
Serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) have been implicated in the mediation of endogenous analgesic mechanisms via the descending inhibitory pain pathway in the brain, and dysfunction in both the 5-HT and NE systems has been suggested as an etiology of fibromyalgia (FM). Given that 5-HT reuptake inhibition in the brain appears to be associated with pain reduction, this mechanism might exert an analgesic effect also on pain associated with FM. In this case, it would be of interest to investigate the correlation of 5-HT transporter (SERT) occupancy with in vivo analgesic effect on pain associated with FM. Here, we investigated the relationship between SERT occupancies and the analgesic effects of AS1069562, the (+)-isomer of indeloxazine, and duloxetine, which are both 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), on muscular pain in reserpine-induced myalgia (RIM) rats, an animal model of FM-like chronic pain. We also investigated the SERT occupancy level necessary for AS1069562 and duloxetine to exert analgesic effects on muscular pain. AS1069562 and duloxetine attenuated muscular hyperalgesia in RIM rats, representing the first findings to be reported regarding the analgesic effect of AS1069562 on pain associated with FM. SERT occupancy levels of AS1069562 and duloxetine increased in both dose- and plasma and brain concentration-dependent manners. SERT occupancy levels of AS1069562 and duloxetine were significantly correlated with efficacy on muscular pain thresholds in RIM rats. This finding concerning the precise correlation of SERT occupancy with in vivo analgesic effect on pain associated with FM is reported here for the first time. SERT occupancy level above 70% was necessary for AS1069562 and duloxetine to exert significant analgesic effects on muscular pain. These results suggest that SERT occupancy level is useful in determining appropriate analgesic doses of AS1069562 and duloxetine for treating pain symptoms in FM patients.

AB  - Abstract
Human African trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness is a severe, neglected tropical disease caused by the extracellular parasite Trypanosoma brucei. The disease, which leads to chronic neuroinflammation, is characterized by sleep and wake disturbances, documented also in rodent models. In rats and mice infected with Trypanosoma brucei brucei, we here tested the hypothesis that the disease could target neurons of the lateral hypothalamus (LH) containing orexin (OX)-A or melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), implicated in sleep/wake regulation. In the cerebrospinal fluid of infected rats, the OX-A level was significantly decreased early after parasite neuroinvasion, and returned to the control level at an advanced disease stage. The number of immunohistochemically characterized OX-A and MCH neurons decreased significantly in infected rats during disease progression and in infected mice at an advanced disease stage. A marked reduction of the complexity of dendritic arborizations of OX-A neurons was documented in infected mice. The evaluation of NeuN-immunoreactive neurons did not reveal significant neuronal loss in the LH of infected mice, thus suggesting a potential selective vulnerability of OX-A and MCH neurons. Immunophenotyping and quantitative analysis showed in infected mice marked activation of microglial cells surrounding OX-A neurons. Day/night oscillation of c-Fos baseline expression was used as marker of OX-A neuron activity in mice. In control animals Fos was expressed in a higher proportion of OX-A neurons in the night (activity) phase than in the day (rest) phase. Interestingly, in infected mice the diurnal spontaneous Fos oscillation was reversed, with a proportion of OX-A/Fos neurons significantly higher at daytime than at nighttime. Altogether the findings reveal a progressive decrease of OX-A and MCH neurons and dysregulation of OX-A neuron diurnal activity in rodent models of sleeping sickness. The data point to the involvement of these peptidergic neurons in the pathogenesis of sleep/wake alterations in the disease and to their vulnerability to inflammatory signaling.

AB  - Abstract
Our understanding of the role of somatosensory feedback in regulating motility during chicken embryogenesis and fetal development in general has been hampered by the lack of an approach to selectively alter specific sensory modalities. In adult mammals, pyridoxine overdose has been shown to cause a peripheral sensory neuropathy characterized by a loss of both muscle and cutaneous afferents, but predominated by a loss of proprioception. We have begun to explore the sensitivity of the nervous system in chicken embryos to the application of pyridoxine on embryonic days 7 and 8, after sensory neurons in the lumbosacral region become post-mitotic. Upon examination of the spinal cord, dorsal root ganglion and peripheral nerves, we find that pyridoxine causes a loss of neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 3-positive neurons, a decrease in the diameter of the muscle innervating nerve tibialis, and a reduction in the number of large diameter axons in this nerve. However, we found no change in the number of Substance P or calcitonin gene-related peptide-positive neurons, the number of motor neurons or the diameter or axonal composition of the femoral cutaneous nerve. Therefore, pyridoxine causes a peripheral sensory neuropathy in embryonic chickens largely consistent with its effects in adult mammals. However, the lesion may be more restricted to proprioception in the chicken embryo. Therefore, pyridoxine lesion induced during embryogenesis in the chicken embryo can be used to assess how the loss of sensation, largely proprioception, alters spontaneous embryonic motility and subsequent motor development.

AB  - Abstract
The present study has been designed to investigate the potential of rifampicin [Pregnane X receptors (PXR) agonist] in experimental dementia. Aluminum chloride (AlCl3) [100 mg/kg, p.o. for 42 days] was administered to Wistar rats (n = 6) to induce dementia. Morris water maze (MWM) test was used to assess learning and memory and rota rod test was used to assess locomotor activity of the animals. A battery of biochemical tests and histopathological evaluation using hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and Congo Red stains were performed at the end of the study. AlCl3-treated rats demonstrated impaired cognition and locomotor activity on MWM apparatus and rota rod test, respectively. These animals exhibited a significant rise in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity (138 ± 3.6), thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) level (15 ± 1.6), nitrite (56 ± 2.4) level and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (4.1 ± 0.9) along with decline in reduced glutathione (GSH) level (22 ± 1.3) in comparison to the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Further the H&amp;E and Congo Red-stained cerebral cortex sections of AlCl3-treated rats indicated severe neutrophilic infiltration and amyloid deposition. Rifampicin-treated AlCl3-rats exhibited significant attenuation in memory deficits, biochemical parameters like AChE activity (33 ± 1.4), TBARS level (4.1 ± 1.0), nitrite level (64 ± 2.6), MPO activity (3.6 ± 1.0) and GSH level (53 ± 2.4) along with improved histopathological alterations and locomotor activity when compared with AlCl3-treated rats (p &lt; 0.05). Combined administration of ketoconazole (a PXR antagonist) and rifampicin to AlCl3-treated animals reversed the rifampicin-induced protective effects. Therefore the results obtained from the study indicate a defensive role of rifampicin in memory dysfunction which may probably be due to its anti-cholinesterase, anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and amyloid lowering effects. Moreover the study speculates the potential of PXR in the pathophysiology of dementia which is subject to further evaluation.

AB  - Abstract
Hearing function lost by degeneration of inner ear spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in the auditory nervous system could potentially be compensated by cellular replacement using suitable donor cells. Donor cell-derived neuronal development with functional synaptic formation with auditory neurons of the cochlear nucleus (CN) in the brainstem is a prerequisite for a successful transplantation. Here a rat auditory brainstem explant culture system was used as a screening platform for donor cells. The explants were co-cultured with human neural precursor cells (HNPCs) to determine HNPCs developmental potential in the presence of environmental cues characteristic for the auditory brainstem region in vitro. We explored effects of pharmacological inhibition of GTPase Rho with its effector Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling on the co-cultures. Pharmacological agents ROCK inhibitor Y27632 and EGFR blocker PD168393 were tested. Effect of the treatment on explant penetration by green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled HNPCs was evaluated based on the following criteria: number of GFP-HNPCs located within the explant; distance migrated by the GFP-HNPCs deep into the explant; length of the GFP+/neuronal class III β-tubulin (TUJ1)+ processes developed and phenotypes displayed. In a short 2-week co-culture both inhibitors had growth-promoting effects on HNPCs, prominent in neurite extension elongation. Significant enhancement of migration and in-growth of HNPCs into the brain slice tissue was only observed in Y27632-treated co-cultures. Difference between Y27632- and PD168393-treated HNPCs acquiring neuronal fate was significant, though not different from the fates acquired in control co-culture. Our data suggest the presence of inhibitory mechanisms in the graft–host environment of the auditory brainstem slice co-culture system with neurite growth arresting properties which can be modulated by administration of signaling pathways antagonists. Therefore the co-culture system can be utilized for screens of donor cells and compounds regulating neuronal fate determination.

AB  - Abstract
The development and maintenance of cocaine addiction depend heavily on learned reward-environment associations that can induce drug-seeking behavior and relapse. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these cue-induced conditioned responses is important for relapse prevention. To test whether intracellular responses measured after cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP) expression are context-dependent, we re-exposed cocaine-treated rats (drug-free) to an environment previously paired with cocaine or saline, 24 h after the CPP test. After 8 days of cocaine CPP training with one of two cocaine doses (5 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg, i.p.), CPP was expressed only after conditioning with the higher cocaine dose. In CPP expressing rats, locomotor responses after re-exposure to the cocaine-chamber were greater than in rats re-exposed to the saline-paired chamber. Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) phosphorylated ERK (pERK) levels were increased after re-exposure to the cocaine-paired, but not the saline-paired chamber, regardless of whether or not CPP behavior was expressed. Caudate Putamen (CPu) pERK and FosB protein levels increased after re-exposure to the cocaine chamber only after conditioning with the higher cocaine dose. Conversely, the higher cocaine dose, independent of environment, resulted in increased NAc FosB, ΔFosB and phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) protein levels compared to those conditioned with 5 mg/kg cocaine (non-CPP-expressing). Our results suggest that NAc ERK phosphorylation may be involved with retrieving the contextual information of a cocaine-association, without necessarily motivating the expression of CPP behavior. Additionally, we show distinct patterns of intracellular responses in the NAc and CPu indicating a region-specific role for pERK/pCREB/FosB intracellular signaling in the retrieval of cocaine-context associations.

AB  - Abstract
An important challenge in olfaction research is to understand how percepts relate to the molecular structure of stimuli. Previous psychophysical studies showed that, whereas structurally simple odorant molecules evoked a more uniform qualitative perception as revealed by the use of a small number of labels to describe their olfactory quality, more complex odorants evoked a larger variety of olfactory qualities, reflecting a more heterogeneous qualitative perception. The present study examined how this influence of odorant molecular complexity on perception is reflected in the human brain. To this end, participants were stimulated with structurally simple and complex odorant molecules and their brain responses were assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Low- and high-complexity odorants were judged to have the same intensity, pleasantness and familiarity (p &gt; 0.05 in all cases), whereas complex odorants induced more quality labels than simple odorants (p &lt; 0.02) as expected. Imaging analysis of complex vs. simple odorants revealed significant activation in dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus, but not in primary olfactory areas. Taken together, these findings suggest dissociated neural representations of uniform and heterogeneous olfactory perception, highlighting for the first time the impact of odorant complexity on activity of the cingulate gyrus.

AB  - Abstract
Nuclear hormone receptor coregulator-interacting factor 1 (NIF-1) is a zinc finger nuclear protein that was initially identified to enhance nuclear hormone receptor transcription via its interaction with nuclear hormone receptor coregulator (NRC). NIF-1 may regulate gene transcription either by modulating general transcriptional machinery or remodeling chromatin structure through interactions with specific protein partners. We previously reported that the cytoplasmic/nuclear localization of NIF-1 is regulated by the neuronal Cdk5 activator p35, suggesting potential neuronal functions for NIF-1. The present study reveals that NIF-1 plays critical roles in regulating neuronal morphogenesis at early stages. NIF-1 was prominently expressed in the nuclei of developing rat cortical neurons. Knockdown of NIF-1 expression attenuated both neurite outgrowth in cultured cortical neurons and retinoic acid (RA)-treated Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells. Furthermore, activity-induced Ca2+ influx, which is critical for neuronal morphogenesis, stimulated the nuclear localization of NIF-1 in cortical neurons. Suppression of NIF-1 expression reduced the up-regulation of neuronal activity-dependent gene transcription. These findings collectively suggest that NIF-1 directs neuronal morphogenesis during early developmental stages through modulating activity-dependent gene transcription.

AB  - Abstract
Cerebral malaria (CM) is a severe complication resulting from Plasmodium falciparum infection that might cause permanent neurological deficits. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a nonpsychotomimetic compound of Cannabis sativa with neuroprotective properties. In the present work, we evaluated the effects of CBD in a murine model of CM. Female mice were infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) and treated with CBD (30 mg/kg/day – 3 or 7 days i.p.) or vehicle. On 5th day-post-infection (dpi), at the peak of the disease), animals were treated with single or repeated doses of Artesunate, an antimalarial drug. All groups were tested for memory impairment (Novel Object Recognition or Morris Water Maze) and anxiety-like behaviors (Open field or elevated plus maze test) in different stages of the disease (at the peak or after the complete clearance of the disease). Th1/Th2 cytokines and neurotrophins (brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF)) were measured in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of experimental groups. PbA-infected mice displayed memory deficits and exhibited increase in anxiety-like behaviors on the 5 dpi or after the clearance of the parasitemia, effects prevented by CBD treatment. On 5 dpi, TNF-α and IL-6 increased in the hippocampus, while only IL-6 increased in the prefrontal cortex. CBD treatment resulted in an increase in BDNF expression in the hippocampus and decreased levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus (TNF-α) and prefrontal cortex (IL-6). Our results indicate that CBD exhibits neuroprotective effects in CM model and might be useful as an adjunctive therapy to prevent neurological symptoms following this disease.

AB  - Abstract
We have previously reported a time-dependent increase in melatonin (MLT) and decrease in dopamine (DA) in striatal dialysate 3 weeks after unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioning in the rat substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and medial forebrain bundle (MFB). This study aimed to investigate dynamic and circadian variations in DA, MLT, glutamate (Glu) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in striatal dialysates in the same 6-OHDA animal model. These neurotransmitters were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Three weeks following 6-OHDA lesioning, there was a significant increase in extracellular Glu (156%) and decrease in GABA (15%) and DA (85%) in the lesioned striatum. These changes continued over time. Concomitantly, MLT was increased by 107% in the lesioned striatal dialysates after 4 weeks, and continued to increase gradually over time. Six weeks post-treatment, levels of MLT secretion at 12 time points were higher, and the peak time of MLT secretion was earlier, in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats compared with vehicle-treated rats. In addition, significant variations in extracellular levels of Glu and GABA between day and night were observed in vehicle-treated rat striatum. However, no circadian variations were observed in the striatum of unilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. Six weeks post-treatment, MLT levels correlated well with Glu and GABA levels at corresponding time-points in the striatum ipsilateral to the injected side in both groups, and increased MLT levels also correlated well with changes in Glu and GABA in the striatum in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. These data suggest that 6-OHDA lesioning affects the endogenous productions of DA, MLT, Glu and GABA, and changes the MLT secretion pattern. Augmented striatal MLT levels and advanced MLT secretion pattern caused by unilateral intracerebral injection of 6-OHDA may influence the variations in Glu and GABA between day and night.

AB  - Abstract
Subchronic treatment with the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist phencyclidine (PCP) produces behavioral abnormalities in rodents which are considered a reliable pharmacological model of neurocognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Alterations in prefrontal neuronal firing after acute PCP administration have been observed, however enduring changes in prefrontal activity after subchronic PCP treatment have not been studied. To address this we have recorded cortical oscillations and unit responses in putative cortical pyramidal cells in subchronic PCP-treated rats (2 mg/kg twice daily for 7 days) under urethane anesthesia. We found that this regimen reduced theta oscillations in the medial prefrontal cortex. It further produced abnormal cortical synchronization in putative cortical pyramidal cells. These alterations in prefrontal cortex functioning may contribute to cognitive deficits seen in subchronic NMDA antagonist pre-treated animals in prefrontal-dependent tasks.

AB  - Abstract
Adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) is the main co-transmitter accompanying the release of acetylcholine from motor nerve terminals. Previously, we revealed the direct inhibitory action of extracellular ATP on transmitter release via redox-dependent mechanism. However, the receptor mechanism of ATP action and ATP-induced sources of reactive oxygen sources (ROS) remained not fully understood. In the current study, using microelectrode recordings of synaptic currents from the frog neuromuscular junction, we analyzed the receptor subtype involved in synaptic action of ATP, receptor coupling to NADPH oxidase and potential location of ATP receptors within the lipid rafts. Using subtype-specific antagonists, we found that the P2Y13 blocker 2-[(2-chloro-5-nitrophenyl)azo]-5-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-[(phosphonooxy)methyl]-4-pyridinecarboxaldehyde did not prevent the depressant action of ATP. In contrast, the P2Y12 antagonist 2-methylthioadenosine 5′-monophosphate abolished the inhibitory action of ATP, suggesting the key role of P2Y12 receptors in ATP action. As the action of ATP is redox-dependent, we also tested potential involvement of the NADPH oxidase, known as a common inducer of ROS. The depressant action of extracellular ATP was significantly reduced by diphenyleneiodonium chloride and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, two structurally different inhibitors of NADPH oxidase, indicating that this enzyme indeed mediates the action of ATP. Since the location and activity of various receptors are often associated with lipid rafts, we next tested whether ATP-driven inhibition depends on lipid rafts. We found that the disruption of lipid rafts with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin reduced and largely delayed the action of ATP. Taken together, these data revealed key steps in the purinergic control of synaptic transmission via P2Y12 receptors associated with lipid rafts, and identified NADPH oxidase as the main source of ATP-induced inhibitory ROS at the neuromuscular junction. Our data suggest that the location of P2Y receptors in lipid rafts speeds up the modulatory effect of ATP. Uncovered mechanisms may contribute to motor dysfunctions and neuromuscular diseases associated with oxidative stress.

AB  - Abstract
Steroid hormones are important players to regulate adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, but their involvement in the regulation of the same phenomenon in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles is not completely understood. Here, in male rats, we tested the existence of activational effects of testosterone (T) on cell proliferation in the adult SVZ. To this aim, three groups of male rats: castrated, castrated and treated with T, and controls were treated with 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and killed after 24 h. The density of BrdU-labeled cells was significantly lower in castrated animals in comparison to the other two groups, thus supporting a direct correlation between SVZ proliferation and levels of circulating T. To clarify whether this effect is purely androgen-dependent, or mediated by the T metabolites, estradiol (E2) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), we evaluated SVZ proliferation in castrated males treated with E2, DHT and E2 + DHT, in comparison to T- and vehicle-treated animals, and sham-operated controls. The stereological analysis demonstrated that E2 and T, but not DHT, increase proliferation in the SVZ of adult male rats. Quantitative evaluation of cells expressing the endogenous marker of cell proliferation phosphorylated form of Histone H3 (PHH3), or the marker of highly dividing SVZ progenitors Mash1, indicated the effect of T/E2 is mostly restricted to SVZ proliferating progenitors. The same experimental protocol was repeated on ovariectomized female rats treated with E2 or T. In this case, no statistically significant difference was found among groups. Overall, our results clearly show that the gonadal hormones T and E2 represent important mediators of cell proliferation in the adult SVZ. Moreover, we show that such an effect is restricted to males, supporting adult neurogenesis in rats is a process differentially modulated in the two sexes.

AB  - Abstract
Up-regulation in phosphodiesterase 1 (PDE1) expression and decreased levels of cyclic nucleotides (cAMP and cGMP) have been reported in patients and experimental animal models of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors have been reported to be beneficial in cognitive and motor deficit states. The present study is designed to investigate the effect of vinpocetine, a PDE1 inhibitor in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced experimental PD-like symptoms in rats. To produce stable motor deficit, MPTP was repeatedly administered intranigrally (bilaterally) at an interval of 1 week (days 1, 7 and 14). Following development of stable motor deficit, which was observed after the third infusion of MPTP (day 14) in rats, the animals were treated with vinpocetine (5-, 10- and 20-mg/kg, i.p.) from days 15 to 28. Movement abnormalities were assessed by a battery of behavioral tests. Moreover, levels of malondialdehyde, nitrite and reduced glutathione were measured in striatal brain homogenate to confirm the role of oxidative and nitrosative stress in PD. Repeated intranigral administration of MPTP produced stable motor deficits, reduced the cyclic nucleotides and dopamine levels and caused elevation in oxidative–nitrosative stress markers. Chronic administration of vinpocetine (for 14 days) significantly and dose dependently attenuated movement disabilities and oxidative–nitrosative stress in MPTP-treated rats. Moreover, vinpocetine treatment enhances cyclic nucleotide levels and restores the dopamine level in MPTP-treated rats. The observed results of the present study are indicative of the therapeutic potential of vinpocetine in PD.

AB  - Abstract
Patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) present hippocampal (HPC) dysfunction, which may facilitate fear-related phenomena such as fear learning sensitization (i.e. potentiation of fear acquisition by initial fear conditioning (FC1)) and fear return (i.e. reactivation of extinguished fear). Fear return is sensitive to HPC high-frequency stimulation (HFS) in rats. The goal of the present study was to examine whether fear learning sensitization is also sensitive to HPC HFS in rats. We found in control conditions that, after FC1 (with 15 shock administrations) and extinction, conditioning in a different context with one shock administration was potentiated (proactive effect) and associated with fear return in the initial context (retroactive effect). Both phenomena were prevented by HPC HFS applied before the second conditioning. We also found that the effect of HPC HFS on fear learning sensitization required initial extinction. These findings suggest a pivotal role of the HPC in preventing proactive and retroactive effects of successive fear conditionings. These data also support the concept that HPC deactivation may be involved in fear learning sensitization and fear return in PTSD patients.

AB  - AbstractObjective
Prenatal exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or high-fat diet (HFD) results in hippocampal impairment and cognitive deficits in offspring rats. What is not clear is how prenatal exposure to LPS combined with pre- and post-natal HFD would affect the hippocampus in offspring rats.
Methods
32 pregnant rats were randomly divided into four groups, including control group; LPS group (pregnant rats were injected with LPS 0.4 mg/kg intraperitoneally on the 8th, 10th and 12th day of pregnancy); HFD group (maternal rats had HFD during pregnancy and the lactation period, and their pups also had HFD up to the third month of life); LPS + HFD group (rats were exposed to the identical experimental scheme with LPS group and HFD group). The serum IL-6 and TNF-alpha concentration was measured in three-month-old offspring rats in all groups. Hippocampal morphology and expressions of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Tau and synaptophysin (SYP) in offspring rats were measured.
Results
Serum IL-6 and TNF-alpha concentration in the HFD group increased significantly compared with the control group, LPS group and LPS + HFD group. Compared with the control group and the LPS + HFD group, cells in the LPS and HFD groups were smaller and arranged in disorder, and cell membrane was not complete, nucleoli and nuclear heterochromatin stained darkly with hematoxylin. GFAP and Tau expression in the hippocampus of the LPS and HFD groups increased significantly compared with the control group and LPS + HFD group. SYP expression in the LPS and HFD groups decreased significantly compared with the control group and HFD group, increased in the LPS + HFD group.
Conclusion
Prenatal exposure to LPS combined with pre- and post-natal HFD result in a protective effect on the hippocampus in offspring rats, and it might be a benefit from the predictive adaptive response to prenatal inflammation.

AB  - Abstract
Tea polyphenols (TPs) are bioactive flavanol-related catechins that have been shown to protect dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons against neurotoxin-induced injury in mouse Parkinson’s disease (PD) models. However, the neuroprotective efficacy of TP has not been investigated in nonhuman PD primates, which can more accurately model the neuropathology and motor impairments of human PD patients. Here, we show that oral administration of TP alleviates motor impairments and DAergic neuronal injury in the substantia nigra in N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-intoxicated PD monkeys, indicating an association between protection against motor deficits and preservation of DAergic neurons. We also show a significant inhibition of MPTP-induced accumulation of neurotoxic α-synuclein (α-syn) oligomers in the striatum and other brain regions, which may contribute to the neuroprotection and improved motor function conferred by TP. The association between reduced α-syn oligomerization and neuroprotection was confirmed in cultured DAergic cells. The most abundant and bioactive TP in the mixture used in vivo, (–)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, reduced intracellular levels of α-syn oligomers in neurons treated with α-syn oligomers, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridiniumion, or both, accompanied by increased cell viability. The present study provides the first evidence that TP can alleviate motor impairments, DAergic neuronal injury, and α-syn aggregation in nonhuman primates.

AB  - Abstract
Inflammation is an important event in ischemic injury. These immune responses begin with the expression of pro-inflammatory genes modulating transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), activator protein-1 (AP-1), and signal transducers and activator of transcription-1 (STAT-1). The 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) can both induce and arrest inflammatory reactions and lead to improved neurological outcome in experimental brain injury and ischemia. Since Hsp70 are induced under heat stress, we investigated the link between Hsp70 neuroprotection and phosphorylation of inhibitor of κB (IκB), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and p38 through co-immunoprecipitation and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay. Transcription factors and pro-inflammatory genes were quantified by immunoblotting, electrophoretic-mobility shift assay and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays.

The results showed that heat stress led to Hsp70 overexpression which rendered neuroprotection after ischemia-like injury. Overexpression Hsp70 also interrupts the phosphorylation of IκB, JNK and p38 and blunts DNA binding of their transcription factors (NF-κB, AP-1 and STAT-1), effectively downregulating the expression of pro-inflammatory genes in heat-pretreated astrocytes. Taken together, these results suggest that overexpression of Hsp70 may protect against brain ischemia via an anti-inflammatory mechanism by interrupting the phosphorylation of upstream of transcription factors.

AB  - Abstract
The visceral insular cortex (VIC) has previously been shown to play a critical role during acute nausea-induced conditioned gaping in rats. Specifically, localized administration of the conventional anti-emetic, ondansetron or the synthetic cannabinoid, HU210, interferes with the establishment of conditioned gaping, likely by reducing the effects of an illness-inducing treatment. However the precise role of the VIC in endocannabinoid-suppression of nausea remains unknown; thus we investigated the potential of localized intra-VIC endocannabinoid administration to interfere with acute nausea-induced conditioned gaping behavior in male Sprague–Dawley rats. Animals received an intraoral infusion of saccharin (0.1%) followed by intra-VIC exogenous N-arachidonoylethanolamide (AEA; 0.4, 4 μg) or 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG; 0.5, 1 μg), and were subsequently injected with nausea-inducing LiCl (0.15 M) 15 min later. Bilateral intra-VIC infusions of 2-AG (1 μg, but not 0.5 μg) dose-dependently suppressed conditioned gaping, whereas exogenous AEA was without effect. Interestingly, 2-AG reduced conditioned gaping despite additional pretreatment with the selective cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) antagonist, AM-251; however, concomitant pretreatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (0.5 μg), blocked the suppressive effects of intra-VIC 2-AG. These findings suggest that the modulatory role of the endocannabinoid system during nausea is driven largely by the endocannabinoid, 2-AG, and that its anti-nausea effects may be partly independent of CB1-receptor signaling through metabolic products of the endocannabinoid system.

AB  - Abstract
Since that fast food consumption have raised concerns about people’s health, we evaluated the influence of trans fat consumption on behavioral, biochemical and molecular changes in the brain-cortex of second generation rats exposed to a model of mania. Two successive generations of female rats were supplemented with soybean oil (SO, rich in n-6 FA, control group), fish oil (FO, rich in n-3 FA) and hydrogenated vegetable fat (HVF, rich in trans FA) from pregnancy, lactation to adulthood, when male rats from 2nd generation received amphetamine (AMPH-4 mg/kg-i.p., once a day, for 14 days) treatment. AMPH increased locomotor index in all animals, which was higher in the HVF group. While the FO group showed increased n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) incorporation and reduced n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio, HVF allowed trans fatty acid (TFA) incorporation and increased n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio in the brain-cortex. In fact, the FO group showed minor AMPH-induced hyperactivity, decreased reactive species (RS) generation per se, causing no changes in protein carbonyl (PC) levels and dopamine transporter (DAT). FO supplementation showed molecular changes, since proBDNF was increased per se and reduced by AMPH, decreasing the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level following drug treatment. Conversely, HVF was related to increased hyperactivity, higher PC level per se and higher AMPH-induced PC level, reflecting on DAT, whose levels were decreased per se as well as in AMPH-treated groups. In addition, while HVF increased BDNF-mRNA per se, AMPH reduced this value, acting on BDNF, whose level was lower in the same AMPH-treated experimental group. ProBDNF level was influenced by HVF supplementation, but it was not sufficient to modify BDNF level. These findings reinforce that prolonged consumption of trans fat allows TFA incorporation in the cortex, facilitating hyperactive behavior, oxidative damages and molecular changes. Our study is a warning about cross-generational consumption of processed food, since high trans fat may facilitate the development of neuropsychiatric conditions, including bipolar disorder (BD).

AB  - Abstract
Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) is a potent neurotrophic factor promoting survival of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in vitro and in vivo. FGF-2 is expressed in different isoforms representing distinct translation products from a single mRNA. For this study, we focused on the high molecular weight (HMW) isoform, which, after non-viral plasmid-based overexpression in embryonic day 12 (E12) rat ventral mesencephalon (VM)-derived cells, revealed increased numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+) cells in a ‘colayer’ cell culture model. To determine the therapeutic potential of VM cells producing FGF-2-HMW as their ‘own’ neurotrophic factor, we transplanted cell suspensions obtained from such in vitro modified and differentiated cell cultures into the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) hemiparkinsonian rat model. Animals, having received either non-transfected cells, empty-control transfected, or FGF-2-HMW-plasmid transfected cells, were analyzed in two different transplantation paradigms each using 172,000 or 520,000 cells, respectively. The behavioral performances in the amphetamine- and apomorphine-induced rotational test as well as in the cylinder test were evaluated for up to thirteen weeks post transplantation (postTX). Finally, the integration of the grafted cells into the host striatum was analyzed by immunohistochemical measurements. Those analyses revealed improvements of behavioral deficits in all five groups receiving DA neuron grafts, except for amphetamine-induced rotation of the FGF-2-HMW small graft group. Altogether, genetic modification with the FGF-2-HMW-plasmid did not further improve functional recovery compared to the control groups and had no influence on either the number of surviving DA neurons or on the density of outgrowing TH+ fibers.

AB  - Abstract
Aging has been associated with oxidative stress and the accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation. The previous study has established a mimetic rat model of aging using d-galactose (d-gal) and revealed that chronic injection of d-gal can increase NADPH oxidase (NOX)-dependent oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage and apoptosis in the peripheral auditory system. However, the effects of NOXs in the central auditory system (CAS) were still obscure. The current study was designed to investigate potential causative mechanisms of central presbycusis by using the d-gal-induced aging rats. We found that the levels of H2O2 and the expression of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) and its corresponding subunits P22phox, P47phox and P67phox were greatly increased in the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) of d-gal-treated rats as compared with controls. And, the levels of a typical biomarker of oxidative stress, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and the accumulation of mtDNA common deletion (CD) were also increased in the VCN of d-gal-treated rats as compared with controls. Moreover, the damage of mitochondrial ultrastructure, a decline in ATP levels, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), an increase in the amount of cytochrome c (cyt c) translocated to the cytoplasm and caspase-3 activation were observed in the VCN induced by d-gal. In addition, we also found that the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) nick-end-labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells in the VCN were increased in d-gal-treated rats. Taken together, these findings suggest that NOX2-dependent oxidative stress may contribute to mitochondrial damage and activate a caspase-3-dependent apoptosis pathway in the CAS during aging. This study also provides new insights into the development of presbycusis.

AB  - Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) increases the risk for late-onset seizures and neuronal network abnormalities. An elevated co-occurrence of AD and seizures has been established in the more prevalent sporadic form of AD. Recent evidence suggests that nonconvulsive network abnormalities, including seizures and other electroencephalographic abnormalities, may be more commonly found in patients than previously thought. Patients with familial AD are at an even greater risk for seizures, which have been found in patients with mutations in PSEN1, PSEN2, or APP, as well as with APP duplication. This review also provides an overview of seizure and electroencephalography studies in AD mouse models. The amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide has been identified as a possible link between AD and seizures, and while Aβ is known to affect neuronal activity, the full-length amyloid precursor protein (APP) and other APP cleavage products may be important for the development and maintenance of cortical network hyperexcitability. Nonconvulsive epileptiform activity, such as seizures or network abnormalities that are shorter in duration but may occur with higher frequency, may contribute to cognitive impairments characteristic of AD, such as amnestic wandering. Finally, the review discusses recent studies using antiepileptic drugs to rescue cognitive deficits in AD mouse models and human patients. Understanding the mechanistic link between epileptiform activity and AD is a research area of growing interest. Further understanding of the connection between neuronal hyperexcitability and Alzheimer’s as well as the potential role of epileptiform activity in the progression of AD will be beneficial for improving treatment strategies.

AB  - Abstract
Tanshinone IIA (TSA) is a lipid soluble agent derived from the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen). This plant is a traditional Chinese herb, which has been used widely in China especially for enhancing circulation. However mechanisms underlying its efficacy remain poorly understood. The present study was designed to illuminate events that may underlie the apparently neuroprotective effects of TSA following ischemic insult. Adult Sprague–Dawley rats were subjected to transient focal cerebral ischemia by use of a middle cerebral artery occlusion model. They were then randomly divided into a sham-operated control group, and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion groups receiving a two-hour occlusion. Further subsets of groups received the same durations of occlusion or were sham-operated but then received daily i.p. injections of high or low doses of TSA, for seven or 15 days. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed lesions in the entorhinal cortex of both rats subject to ischemia and to a lesser extent to those receiving TSA after surgery. Levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), caspase-3 and caspase-8, were quantified by both immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. TSA treatment after middle cerebral artery occlusion, markedly reduced infarct size, and reduced the expression of caspase-3 and caspase-8. These changes were considered protective and were generally proportional to the dose of TSA used. These results suggest that TSA may effect neuroprotection by way of reduction of the extent of cell inflammation and death within affected regions.

AB  - Abstract
The endocannabinoid system mainly consists of cannabinoid receptors type 1 (CB1R) and type 2 (CB2R), their endogenous ligands termed endocannabinoids (eCBs), and the enzymes responsible for the synthesis and degradation of eCBs. These cannabinoid receptors have been well characterized in rodent and monkey retinae. Here, we investigated the expression and localization of the eCB system beyond the retina, namely the first thalamic relay, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), of vervet monkeys using immunohistochemistry methods. Our results show that CB1R is expressed throughout the dLGN with more prominent labeling in the magnocellular layers. The same pattern is observed for the degradation enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). However, the synthesizing enzyme N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) is expressed homogenously throughout the dLGN with no preference for any of the layers. These proteins are weakly expressed in the koniocellular layers. These results suggest that the presence of the eCB system throughout the layers of the dLGN may represent a novel site of neuromodulatory action in normal vision. The larger amount of CB1R in the dLGN magnocellular layers may explain some of the behavioral effects of cannabinoids associated with the integrity of the dorsal visual pathway that plays a role in visual-spatial localization and motion perception.

AB  - Abstract
Rotenone (RT) produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) by inhibiting the mitochondrial electron transport chain; causing dopaminergic (DA) cell death in the substantia nigra (SN) and simulates other models of induced Parkinson’s disease (PD). There is a sincere dearth of knowledge regarding the status of glial cells, neuroprotective estrogen and the status of neuroinflammatory TNF-α in the different brain regions in either sex during healthy, as well as during PD conditions. In the present study of RT-induced mouse model of PD, we have selected the frontal cortex (FC), hippocampus (HC) and SN from either sex of Swiss albino mice as these are the major regions involved during PD pathogenesis.

During non pathogenic conditions, the ROS-scavenging enzyme activity varied among the brain regions and also in between genders. The number of DOPA decarboxylase-positive cells, astrocytes and microglia was similar in the respective regions of the brain in both the sexes. The level of proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α was same in the respective FC and HC in either sex except that of SN. The expression level of estrogen and its receptors varied among the three brain regions. During RT treatment, ROS-scavenging enzyme activities increased, DOPA decarboxylase-positive neurons and fibers in DA as well as in norepinephrinergic (NE) systems become degenerated, number of astrocytes decreased and microglial cells increased in those specific brain regions in either of the sexes except in the SN region of males where astrocyte number remained unaltered and microglial cell percentage decreased. TNF-α increased in the FC and SN but remained unaltered in the HC of both sexes. Estradiol level decreased in the HC and SN but the level unevenly varied in the FC. Similarly, the estrogen bound and nuclear-cytosolic receptor α and β also varied differentially among the brain regions of the two sexes.

Therefore our present study depicts that there exists a clear variation of neuronal and astroglial cell population, estrogen and its receptor levels in different brain regions of both the sexes during control and RT-treated pathogenic condition and these variations have major implication in PD pathogenesis and progression.

AB  - Abstract
The myelin-associated protein Nogo-A is among the most potent neurite growth inhibitors in the adult CNS. Recently, Nogo-A expression was demonstrated in a number of neuronal subpopulations of the adult and developing CNS but at present, little is known about the expression of Nogo-A in the nigrostriatal system, a brain structure severely affected in Parkinson’s disease (PD). The present study sought to characterize the expression pattern of Nogo-A immunoreactive (ir) cells in the adult ventral mesencephalon of control rats and in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of PD. Immunohistochemical analyses of normal adult rat brain showed a distinct expression of Nogo-A in the ventral mesencephalon, with the highest level in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) where it co-localized with dopaminergic neurons. Analyses conducted 1 week and 1 month after unilateral striatal injections of 6-OHDA disclosed a severe loss of the number of Nogo-A-ir cells in the SNc. Notably, at 1 week after treatment, more dopaminergic neurons expressing Nogo-A were affected by the 6-OHDA toxicity than Nogo-A-negative dopaminergic neurons. However, at later time points more of the surviving dopaminergic neurons expressed Nogo-A. In the striatum, both small and large Nogo-A-positive cells were detected. The large cells were identified as cholinergic interneurons. Our results suggest yet unidentified functions of Nogo-A in the CNS beyond the inhibition of axonal regeneration and plasticity, and may indicate a role for Nogo-A in PD.

AB  - Abstract
The development and exacerbation of depression and anxiety are associated with exposure to repeated psychosocial stress. Stress is known to affect the bidirectional communication between the nervous and immune systems leading to elevated levels of stress mediators including glucocorticoids (GCs) and catecholamines and increased trafficking of proinflammatory immune cells. Animal models, like the repeated social defeat (RSD) paradigm, were developed to explore this connection between stress and affective disorders. RSD induces activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis activation, increases bone marrow production and egress of primed, GC-insensitive monocytes, and stimulates the trafficking of these cells to tissues including the spleen, lung, and brain. Recently, the observation that these monocytes have the ability to traffic to the brain perivascular spaces and parenchyma have provided mechanisms by which these peripheral cells may contribute to the prolonged anxiety-like behavior associated with RSD. The data that have been amassed from the RSD paradigm and others recapitulate many of the behavioral and immunological phenotypes associated with human anxiety disorders and may serve to elucidate potential avenues of treatment for these disorders. Here, we will discuss novel and key data that will present an overview of the neuroendocrine, immunological and behavioral responses to social stressors.

The present study investigated the effects of chronic social defeat stress on several behavioral parameters, and the expression of dopaminergic markers, i.e., dopamine D1 receptors (D1Rs), dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs), and dopamine and cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate-regulated phosphoprotein-32 (DARPP-32), in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (AMY), and hippocampus (HIP) of mouse brains. After 10 days of social defeat stress, the defeated mice were divided into two groups: one group underwent a series of behavioral tests. The other group was sacrificed on the 11th day and tissue samples were collected for Western blotting. The behavioral tests comprised tests of locomotion, light/dark preference, social interaction, as well as the novel object recognition test (NORT), Morris water maze, and forced swimming test (FST). We measured the expression of D1Rs, D2Rs, total DARPP-32, phospho-Thr34 or Thr75-DARPP-32 using Western blotting. The defeated mice showed increased anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, and impaired cognition. No significant differences in D1Rs and D2Rs expression were shown between defeated and control mice in any area studied. A significantly increased expression in total DARPP-32, and phospho-DARPP-32 was observed in the PFC or AMY of defeated mice. These data suggest that alterations in dopaminergic markers may be involved in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors, and cognitive impairment induced by social defeat stress.

Tastes and odors influence the perception of a meal. Especially food aromas can act as potent signals to modulate our eating behavior with strong dependency on the reward produced by food. In this investigation we aimed to study the electrophysiological response to food- and non-food-related odors in healthy volunteers. Analyses revealed specific scalp potential maps for the two conditions; in particular the source of the map in the “food” condition seemed to be associated with the processing of rewards; the specific map in the “non-food” condition reflects odor characteristics excluding the reward.

AB  - Abstract
Sex- and season-specific modulation of hippocampal size and function is observed across multiple species, including rodents. Other non-hippocampal-dependent behaviors exhibit season and sex differences, and whether the associated brain regions exhibit similar variation with sex and season remains to be fully characterized. As such, we examined the brains of wild-caught Richardson’s ground squirrels (RGS; Urocitellus richardsonii) for seasonal (breeding, non-breeding) and sex differences in the volumes of specific brain areas, including: total brain volume, corpus callosum (CC), anterior commissure (AC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), total neocortex (NC), entorhinal cortex (EC), and superior colliculus (SC). Analyses of variance and covariance revealed significant interactions between season and sex for almost all areas studied, primarily resulting from females captured during the breeding season exhibiting larger volumes than females captured during the non-breeding season. This was observed for volumes of the AC, mPFC, NC, EC, and SC. Where simple main effects of season were observed for males (the NC and the SC), the volume advantage favoured males captured during the NBr season. Only two simple main effects of sex were observed: males captured in the non-breeding season had significantly larger total brain volume than females captured in the non-breeding season, and females captured during the breeding season had larger volumes of the mPFC and EC than males captured in the breeding season. These results indicate that females have more pronounced seasonal differences in brain and brain region sizes. The extent to which seasonal differences in brain region volumes vary with behaviour is unclear, but our data do suggest that seasonal plasticity is not limited to the hippocampus and that RGS is a useful mammalian species for understanding seasonal plasticity in an ecologically relevant context.

AB  - Abstract
The effect of lacosamide (LCS), a functionalized molecule with anti-convulsant properties, on ion channels was investigated, with the aid of patch clamp technology and simulation modeling. In NSC-34 neuronal cells, LCS was found to block voltage-gated Na+ current (INa) in a frequency- and concentration-dependent manner. With the two-step voltage protocol, a minimal change in the steady-state inactivation of INa was found in the presence of LCS. However, with repetitive stimulation, the pulse-to-pulse reduction in peak current was shown to be exponential, with a rate linearly related to both the inter-stimulus interval and the LCS concentration. In addition, the frequency-dependent blocking properties were modeled by considering the drug interaction with a voltage-dependent mixture of NaV channels harboring either an accessible or an inaccessible binding site. LCS also increased the dimension of inactivation space of NaV-channel states, thereby producing the adaptive response of neurons to previous firing. LCS (30 μM) had no effects on the non-inactivating component of INa, while it slightly decreased the amplitude of delayed-rectifier K+ current. Moreover, LCS suppressed the peak amplitude of INa in embryonic cortical neurons. In human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells which expressed SCN5A, LCS attenuated the peak amplitude of INa, in a concentration-dependent fashion. The unique effects of LCS on NaV currents presented here may contribute to its in vivo modulation of cellular excitability.

AB  - Abstract
Drug addiction is associated with dysfunction in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However, the modifications of neuronal activity in mPFC underlying the reinforcing properties of addictive drugs are still unclear. Here we carried out single-unit recording experiments to study the neuronal activity in the prelimbic (PL) cortex of anesthetized rats, after expression of locomotor sensitization to amphetamine. In control rats, an acute injection of amphetamine induced mainly an inhibitory effect on firing rate (FR) and this response was negatively correlated with the basal FR. Sensitized rats showed a higher proportion of excited neurons and the response to amphetamine was independent of basal FR. Moreover, in control rats, acute amphetamine decreased burst rate, whereas in sensitized rats acute amphetamine increased burst rate. These findings indicate that amphetamine sensitization renders mPFC neurons hyperexcitable. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that early withdrawal is associated with an increase in the activity of the mPFC, which could strengthen the PL–Nucleus Accumbens connection, thus facilitating amphetamine-induced locomotor sensitization.

AB  - Abstract
The present study has been designed to explore the possible interaction between hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) pathway in 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP)-induced neurotoxicity in rats. 3-NP produces neurotoxicity by inhibition of the mitochondrial complex II (enzyme succinate dehydrogenase) and by sensitizing the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor. Recent studies have reported the therapeutic potential of HO-1/GSK-3β modulators in different neurodegenerative disorders. However, their exact role is yet to be explored. The present study is an attempt to investigate the effect of pharmacological modulation of HO-1/GSK-3β pathway against 3-NP-induced behavioral, biochemical and molecular alterations in rat. Behavioral observation, oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β)], HO-1 and GSK-3β activity were evaluated post 3-NP treatment. Findings of the present study demonstrate a significant alteration in the locomotor activity, motor coordination, oxidative burden (increased lipid peroxidation, nitrite concentration and decreased endogenous antioxidants), pro-inflammatory mediators [TNF-α, IL-1β], HO-1 and GSK-3β activity in 3-NP-treated animals. Further, administration of hemin (10- and 30-mg/kg; i.p.) and lithium chloride (LiCl) (25- and 50-mg/kg; i.p.) prevented the alteration in body weight, motor impairments, oxidative stress and cellular markers. In addition, combined administration of hemin (10-mg/kg) and LiCl (25-mg/kg) showed synergistic effect on 3-NP-treated rats. Pretreatment with Tin (IV) protoporphyrin (40 μM/kg), HO-1 inhibitor reversed the beneficial effect of LiCl and hemin. Outcomes of the present study suggest that HO-1 and GSK-3β enzymes are involved in the pathophysiology of HD. The modulators of both the pathways might be used as adjuvants or prophylactic therapy for the treatment of HD-like symptoms.

AB  - Abstract
The islands of Calleja (IC) are dense clusters of cells localized within the ventral striatum. The IC have been described as variable in both number and localization from animal-to-animal, however, a quantitative investigation of this variability is unavailable. Further, it is presently unknown whether the IC occupy select areas of the olfactory tubercle (OT), the ventral striatum structure which possesses the IC in mice. To address these questions, we examined the IC of adult C57bl/6 mice. As previously noted, we found substantial inter-hemispheric and inter-mouse variations in the total number of IC. While the IC were observed in all three cell layers of the OT, the bulk of IC occupied layer iii. The span of the IC along the anterior–posterior and medial–lateral axes of the OT was variant. Further, localizations of the IC within the OT also differed across animals. Notably, the probability of observing an IC in the medial OT was greater than that of observing one in the lateral. These data provide a fundamental characterization of both differences and similarities regarding the IC in mice and will be informative for future in vivo studies seeking to perturb and possibly record from the IC. Further, we predict that inter-animal diversity in the IC may be a mechanism for inter-animal differences in behavior, especially reward-related and motivational behaviors.

AB  - Abstract
Previously, we have demonstrated a role for fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) in spinal cord regeneration in both zebrafish and mouse. We have shown that exogenous Fgf2 treatment attenuates astrocytic gliosis and induces glia cells to become progenitors that undergo neurogenesis as well as differentiating into bipolar astrocytes that support axonal regeneration (Goldshmit et al., 2012, 2014). One of the downstream signaling target genes of Fgf is spry4, which acts as a feedback inhibitor for Fgf signaling. In this study we examined the effects of increased endogenous Fgf signaling, in spry4−/− mice, on the early events that occur after spinal cord injury (SCI). We demonstrate that in spry4−/− mice inflammatory responses, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) secretion and macrophage/neutrophil invasion into the lesion site are reduced. In addition, astrocytic gliosis is attenuated and neuronal survival is increased. These results further support a pro-regenerative role of Fgf after SCI, and suggest that increased endogenous Fgf signaling after SCI may contribute to functional recovery and therefore presents this pathway as a target for new therapy development.

AB  - Abstract
Bisphenol A (BPA), a toxic chemical from plastics, is known to produce locomotor abnormalities which may imply the alteration in synaptic activity at Ia-α motoneuron synapse also. However the effect of BPA on this synapse is not known. Therefore, this study was undertaken to examine the effect of BPA on reflexes originating at Ia-α motoneuron synapse in the spinal cord. The experiments were performed on isolated hemisected spinal cords from 4 to 6 d rats. Stimulation of a dorsal root evoked segmental monosynaptic (MSR) and polysynaptic (PSR) reflex potentials in the corresponding ventral root. Nitrite content (indicator of NO activity) of cords was estimated in the presence of BPA with/without antagonists. Superfusion of BPA (3–100 μM) depressed the reflexes in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The depression was ∼20, ∼50 and ∼70% at 10, 30 and 100 μM of BPA, respectively. The 50% depression occurred around 15 min at 30 μM of BPA. Pretreatment with estrogen receptor (ERα) antagonist, tamoxifen, blocked the BPA-induced depression of reflexes, whereas, 17β-estradiol, ER agonist, did not depress the reflexes even up to 10 μM. Further, pretreatment with Nω-Nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (l-NAME) or hemoglobin (Hb) blocked the BPA-induced depression of spinal reflexes. Nitric oxide (NO) donor sodium-nitroprusside depressed the MSR and PSR in a concentration-dependent manner. The nitrite concentration of the cords exposed to BPA was 733 μM/gm of tissue (three times the saline group). Pretreatment with tamoxifen/l-NAME/Hb blocked the BPA-induced increase of nitrite levels. The present observations indicate that BPA depressed spinal synaptic transmission through ERα-dependent NO-mediated mechanisms. The altered synaptic activity may implicate for neurobehavioral locomotor abnormalities after exposure to BPA.

AB  - Abstract
Neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) is a postsynaptic adhesion molecule that determines N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) function and cellular localization. Our recent work showed that Nlgn1 knockout (KO) mice cannot sustain neuronal activity occurring during wakefulness for a prolonged period of time. Since NMDAR-dependent neuronal activity drives an important vascular response, we used multispectral optical imaging to determine if the hemodynamic response to neuronal stimulation is modified in Nlgn1 KO mice. We observed that Nlgn1 KO mice show a 10% lower response rate to forepaw electrical stimulation compared to wild-type (WT) and heterozygote (HET) littermates on both the contra- and ipsilateral sides of the somatosensory cortex. Moreover, Nlgn1 mutant mice showed an earlier oxyhemoglobin peak response that tended to return to baseline faster than in WT mice. Analysis of the time course of the hemodynamic response also showed that HET mice express a faster dynamics of cerebrovascular response in comparison to WT. Taken together, these data are indicative of an altered immediate response of the brain to peripheral stimulation in Nlgn1 KO mice, and suggest a role for NLGN1 in the regulation of cerebrovascular responses.

AB  - Abstract
Hemifacial spasm (HFS) is a peripheral nerve disorder which impacts the living quality of patients both psychologically and physically. Whether HFS has structural changes under these specific stressors including psychological and physiological conditions in the CNS remains largely unknown. In the current study, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to evaluate changes in gray matter (GM) by using T1-weighted imaging in 25 HFS patients and 25 demographically similar healthy volunteers. The severity of the spasm was assessed using a Cohen evaluation scale. Hamilton anxiety (HAMA) and Hamilton depression (HAMD) rating scales were used to evaluate the affective conditions of subjects. 3D-FIESTA and 3D-TOF sequences were applied to evaluate the neurovascular compression (NVC) rating in each subject. In our results, we found that HFS patients had higher NVC rating scores than those of healthy volunteers, and the spasm severity rating was positively correlated with the NVC rating (r = 0.736, p &lt; 0.001). HFS patients had higher scores on the HAMA and HAMD compared with healthy volunteers. For the GM comparison, reductions were found in the thalamus, putamen, pallidum, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus in patients with HFS compared with healthy volunteers. Additionally, the GM volume changes in the amygdala did not exhibit any significant between-group differences with HAMA and HAMD scores as covariates. Our results suggested that HFS probably led to GM volume abnormalities of the CNS. We indicated that the GM volume changes of the amygdala may be highly related to emotional factors.

AB  - Abstract
Working memory refers to the ability to temporarily store and manipulate information that is necessary for complex cognition activities. Previous studies have demonstrated that working memory capacity can be improved by behavioral training, and brain activities in the frontal and parietal cortices and the connections between these regions are also altered by training. Our recent neurofeedback training has proven that the regulation of the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) activity using real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) can improve working memory performance. However, how working memory training promotes interaction between brain regions and whether this promotion correlates with performance improvement remain unclear. In this study, we employed structural equation modeling (SEM) to calculate the interactions between the regions within the working memory network during neurofeedback training. The results revealed that the direct effect of the frontoparietal connection in the left hemisphere was enhanced by the rtfMRI training. Specifically, the increase in the path from the left DLPFC to the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) was positively correlated with improved performance in verbal working memory. These findings demonstrate the important role of the frontoparietal connection in working memory training and suggest that increases in frontoparietal connectivity might be a key factor associated with behavioral improvement.

AB  - Abstract
Neural activity promotes circuit formation in developing systems and during critical periods permanently modifies circuit organization and functional properties. These observations suggest that excessive neural activity, as occurs during seizures, might influence developing neural circuitry with long-term outcomes that depend on age at the time of seizures. We systematically examined long-term structural and functional consequences of seizures induced in rats by kainic acid, pentylenetetrazol, and hyperthermia across postnatal ages from birth through postnatal day 90 in adulthood (P90). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and electrophysiological methods at ⩾P95 following seizures induced from P1 to P90 demonstrated consistent patterns of gross atrophy, microstructural abnormalities in the corpus callosum (CC) and hippocampus, and functional alterations in hippocampal circuitry at ⩾P95 that were independent of the method of seizure induction and varied systematically as a function of age at the time of seizures. Three distinct epochs were observed in which seizures resulted in distinct long-term structural and functional outcomes at ⩾P95. Seizures prior to P20 resulted in DTI abnormalities in CC and hippocampus in the absence of gross cerebral atrophy, and increased paired-pulse inhibition (PPI) in the dentate gyrus (DG) at ⩾P95. Seizures after P30 induced a different pattern of DTI abnormalities in the fimbria and hippocampus accompanied by gross cerebral atrophy with increases in lateral ventricular volume, as well as increased PPI in the DG at ⩾P95. In contrast, seizures between P20 and P30 did not result in cerebral atrophy or significant imaging abnormalities in the hippocampus or white matter, but irreversibly decreased PPI in the DG compared to normal adult controls. These age-specific long-term structural and functional outcomes identify P20–30 as a potential critical period in hippocampal development defined by distinctive long-term structural and functional properties in adult hippocampal circuitry, including loss of capacity for seizure-induced plasticity in adulthood that could influence epileptogenesis and other hippocampal-dependent behaviors and functional properties.

AB  - Abstract
Apart from therapeutic discovery, the study of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has been focused on two challenges: why do a majority of individuals recover with little concern, while a considerable proportion suffer with persistent and often debilitating symptomology; and, how do mild injuries significantly increase risk for an early-onset neurodegeneration? Owing to a lack of observable damage following mTBI, this study was designed to determine if there were changes in neuronal morphology, synaptic connectivity, and epigenetic patterning that could contribute to the manifestation of persistent neurological dysfunction. Prefrontal cortex tissue from male and female rats was used for Golgi-Cox analysis along with the profiling of changes in gene expression (BDNF, DNMT1, FGF2, IGF1, Nogo-A, OXYR, and TERT) and telomere length (TL), following a single mTBI or sham injury in the juvenile period. Golgi-Cox analysis of dendritic branch order, dendritic length, and spine density demonstrate that an early mTBI increases complexity of pyramidal neurons in the mPFC. Furthermore, there are also substantial changes in the expression levels of the seven genes of interest and TL following a single mild injury in this brain region. The results from the neuroanatomical measures and changes in gene expression indicate that the mTBI disrupts normal pruning processes that are typically underway at this point in development. In addition, there are significant interactions between the social environment and epigenetic processes that work in concert to perpetuate neurological dysfunction.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic pain is a significant burden and much is attributed to back muscles. Back muscles and their associated fasciae make important and distinct contributions to back pain. Peptidergic nociceptors innervating these structures contribute to central transmission and pain modulation by peripheral and central actions. Plastic changes that augment and prolong pain are exhibited by neurons containing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) following muscle injury. Subpopulations of neurons containing this peptide have been identified in dorsal root ganglia but the distribution of their fibers in skeletal muscles and associated fasciae has not been fully documented. This study used multiple-labeling immunofluorescence and retrograde axonal tracing to identify dorsal root ganglion cells associated with muscle, and to characterize the distribution and density of their nerve fibers in mouse gastrocnemius and back muscles and in the thoracolumbar fascia. Most nerve fibers in these tissues contained CGRP and two major subpopulations of neurons were found: those containing CGRP and substance P (SP) and those containing CGRP but not SP. Innervation density was three times higher in the thoracolumbar fascia than in muscles of the back. These studies show mouse back and leg muscles are predominantly innervated by neurons containing CGRP, an important modulator of pain signal transmission. There are two distinct populations of neurons containing this peptide and their fibers were three times more densely distributed in the thoracolumbar fascia than back muscles.

AB  - Abstract
Pain is a common and debilitating complication for cancer patients significantly compromising their quality of life. Cancer-induced bone pain involves a complex interplay of molecular events, including mechanisms observed in inflammatory and neuropathic pain states, but also changes unique for cancer-induced bone pain. The P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) is involved in a variety of cellular functions and has been linked to both inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Here we study the analgesic potential of P2X7R antagonism in a rat model of cancer-induced bone pain.

In cancer-bearing animals, the P2X7R antagonist A839977 attenuated dorsal horn neuronal responses in a modality and intensity-specific way. Spinal application of 0.4-mg/kg and 1.2-mg/kg A839977 significantly reduced the evoked responses to high-intensity mechanical and thermal stimulation, whereas no effect was seen in response to low-intensity or electrical stimulation. In contrast, A839977 had no effect on the tested parameters in naïve or sham animals. In awake animals, 40-mg/kg A839977 (i.p.) significantly reduced both early- and late-stage pain behavior. In contrast, no effect was observed in sham or vehicle-treated animals.

The results suggest that the P2X7R is involved in the mechanisms of cancer-induced bone pain, and that P2X7R antagonism might be a useful analgesic target. No effect was observed in sham or naïve animals, indicating that the P2X7R-mediated effect is state-dependent, and might therefore be an advantageous target compared to traditional analgesics.

AB  - Abstract
Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) induce inflammatory responses by activating their receptors, CysLT1R and CysLT2R. We have reported that CysLT2R is involved in neuronal injury, astrocytosis, and microgliosis, and that intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of the selective CysLT2R antagonist HAMI 3379 protects against acute brain injury after focal cerebral ischemia in rats. In the present study, we clarified features of the protective effect of intraperitoneally-injected HAMI 3379 in rats. We found that HAMI 3379 attenuated the acute brain injury 24 h after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with effective doses of 0.1–0.4 mg/kg and a therapeutic window of ∼1 h. It attenuated the neurological deficits, and reduced infarct volume, brain edema, and neuronal loss and degeneration 24 and 72 h after MCAO. RNA interference with i.c.v. injection of CysLT2R short hairpin RNA (shRNA) attenuated the acute injury as well. Also, HAMI 3379 inhibited release of the cytokines IL-1β, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) into the serum and cerebrospinal fluid 24 h after MCAO. Moreover, HAMI 3379 ameliorated the microglial activation and neutrophil accumulation in the ischemic regions, but did not affect astrocyte proliferation 72 h after MCAO. In comparison, the CysLT1R antagonist pranlukast did not affect microglial activation and IFN-γ release, but inhibited astrocyte proliferation and reduced serum IL-4. Thus, we conclude that HAMI 3379 has a protective effect on acute and subacute ischemic brain injury, and attenuates microglia-related inflammation. CysLT2R antagonist(s) alone or in combination with CysLT1R antagonists may be a novel class of therapeutic agents in the treatment of ischemic stroke.

AB  - Abstract
Morphine has a profound role in neurofilament (NF) expression. However, there are very few studies on the fate of NFs during morphine abstinence coinciding with periods of relapse. Mice were treated chronically with morphine to render them tolerant to and dependent on morphine and sacrificed thereafter while another group, treated similarly, was left for 2 months without morphine. A long-lasting alteration in the stoichiometric ratio of the three NFs was observed under both conditions in both the cortex and subcortex. Morphine abstinence caused significant alterations in the phosphorylated and nitrated forms of the three NF subunits. Nitrated neurofilament light polypeptide chain (NFL) was significantly increased during chronic morphine treatment which persisted even after 2 months of morphine withdrawal. Mass spectrometric analysis following two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE)-gel electrophoresis of cytoskeleton fractions of both cortex and subcortex regions identified enzymes associated with energy metabolism, cytoskeleton-associated proteins as well as NFs which showed sustained regulation even after abstinence of morphine for 2 months. It is suggestive that alteration in the levels of some of these proteins may be instrumental in the increased nitration of NFL during morphine exposure. Such gross alteration in NF dynamics is indicative of a concerted biological process of neuroadaptation during morphine abstinence.

AB  - Abstract
Anhedonia is a relevant symptom in depression and schizophrenia. Chronic stress exposure induces in rats escape deficit, disrupts the dopaminergic response to palatable food and the competence to acquire sucrose self-administration (SA), thus configuring a possible model of motivational anhedonia. Repeated lithium administration reverts stress effects and brings back to control values the breaking point (BP) score, a measure of reward motivation. In this study, we tested on this model two antidepressants, imipramine and fluoxetine, and two antipsychotics, haloperidol and clozapine. The dopaminergic response to sucrose consumption was studied in non food-deprived rats in terms of dopamine D1 receptor signaling in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcS). More specifically, we studied the modifications in dopamine and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of Mr 32,000 (DARPP-32) phosphorylation pattern following sucrose consumption. Fluoxetine reverted the escape deficit and showed no effects on dopaminergic response and sucrose SA. Imipramine reverted sucrose SA and dopamine response deficit in half of the rats and the escape deficit in all animals. Haloperidol did not affect stress-induced deficits. Clozapine-treated rats recovered the dopaminergic response to sucrose consumption and the competence to acquire sucrose SA, although they still showed the escape deficit, thus confirming that motivation toward reward may be dissociated from that to punishment escape. These results indicate that imipramine or fluoxetine are not endowed with a rapid onset antianhedonic effect. On the other hand, clozapine treatment showed a motivational antianhedonic activity similar to that observed after lithium treatment.

AB  - Abstract
Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). In the brain, NAMPT is primarily expressed in neurons and can prevent neuronal degeneration. NAMPT is also highly expressed in inflammatory cells, and is responsible for their activation. Since inflammation following traumatic brain injury enhances neuronal damage, we assessed the effects of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), the direct NAMPT metabolite, and FK866, a potent NAMPT inhibitor, on brain injury in a cryoinjury mouse model. Twenty-four hours after brain cryoinjury, the density of neuron and the level of NAD decreased. Both NMN and FK866 alleviated the neuronal loss and decreased the lesion volume. NMN prevented the cryoinjury-induced decrease of NAD level, and FK866 decreased it further. On day 14 after cryoinjury, further neuronal loss occurred, astrocytes and Iba1-positive macrophage/microglia activated, and the NAD level increased. At this time-point, NAMPT expression was strongly induced in Iba1-positive macrophages/microglia in the lesion core. NMN and FK866 also alleviated the neuronal loss and decreased the lesion volume. In addition, FK866 significantly attenuated the activation of astrocytes and Iba1-positive macrophages/microglia, and decreased the NAD, while NMN had no such effects. Taken together, both FK866 and NMN attenuate traumatic brain injury. However, FK866 acts via the inhibition of the NAMPT activity in inflammatory cells resulting in the inhibition of inflammation, whereas NMN is effective via replenishing NAD.

AB  - Abstract
Although the impact of aging on the function of the central nervous system is known, only a limited amount of information is available about accompanying changes affecting the cellular composition of the brain and spinal cord. In the present work we used the isotropic fractionator method to reveal aging-associated changes in the numbers of neuronal and non-neuronal cells harbored by the brain and spinal cord. The experiments were performed on 15-week, 7-month, 13-month, and 25-month-old female mice. The major parts of the brain were studied separately, including the isocortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, olfactory bulb, and the remaining part (i.e., ‘rest of brain’). The proliferative capacity of each structure was assessed by counting the number of Ki-67-positive cells. We found no aging-dependent change when the cellular composition of the isocortex was studied. In contrast, the neuronal and non-neuronal cell numbers of the hippocampus decreased in the 7–25-month period. The neuronal cell number of the olfactory bulb showed positive age-dependence between 15 weeks and 13 months of age and presented a significant decrease thereafter. The cerebellum was characterized by an age-dependent decrease of its neuronal cell number and density. In the rest of brain, the non-neuronal cell number increased with age. The neuronal and non-neuronal cell numbers of the spinal cord increased, whereas its neuronal and non-neuronal densities decreased with age. The number of proliferating cells showed a marked age-dependent decrease in the hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and rest of the brain. In contrast, the number of Ki-67-positive cells increased with age in both the cerebellum and spinal cord. In conclusion, aging-dependent changes affecting the cellular composition of the mouse central nervous system are present but they are diverse and region-specific.

AB  - Abstract
G-protein-coupled receptor 41 (GPR41) also called free fatty acid receptor 3 (FFAR3) is a Gαi-coupled receptor activated by short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) mainly produced from dietary complex carbohydrate fibers in the large intestine as products of fermentation by microbiota. FFAR3 is expressed in enteroendocrine cells, but has recently also been shown to be present in sympathetic neurons of the superior cervical ganglion.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the FFAR3 is present in other autonomic and sensory ganglia possibly influencing gut physiology. Cryostat sections were cut of autonomic and sensory ganglia of a transgenic reporter mouse expressing the monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) gene under the control of the FFAR3 promoter. Control for specific expression was also done by immunohistochemistry with an antibody against the reporter protein. mRFP expression was as expected found not only in neurons of the superior cervical ganglion, but also in sympathetic ganglia of the thoracic and lumbar sympathetic trunk. Further, neurons in prevertebral ganglia expressed the mRFP reporter. FFAR3-mRFP-expressing neurons were also present in both autonomic and sensory ganglia such as the vagal ganglion, the spinal dorsal root ganglion and the trigeminal ganglion. No expression was observed in the brain or spinal cord. By use of radioactive-labeled antisense DNA probes, mRNA encoding the FFAR3 was found to be present in cells of the same ganglia. Further, the expression of the FFAR3 in the ganglia of the transgenic mice was confirmed by immunohistochemistry using an antibody directed against the receptor protein, and double labeling colocalized mRFP and the FFAR3-protein in the same neurons. Finally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) on extracts from the ganglia supported the presence mRNA encoding the FFAR3 in most of the investigated tissues.

These data indicate that FFAR3 is expressed on postganglionic sympathetic and sensory neurons in both the autonomic and somatic peripheral nervous system and that SCFAs act not only through the enteroendocrine system but also directly by modifying physiological reflexes integrating the peripheral nervous system and the gastro-intestinal tract.

AB  - Abstract
Pregnancy is a time of marked neural, physiological and behavioral plasticity in the female and is often a time when women are more vulnerable to stress and stress-related diseases, such as depression and anxiety. Unfortunately the impact of stress during gestation on neurobiological processes of the mother has yet to be fully determined, particularly with regard to changes in the hippocampus; a brain area that plays an important role in stress-related diseases. The present study aimed to determine how stress early in pregnancy may affect hippocampal plasticity in the pregnant female and whether these effects differ from those in virgin females. For this purpose, adult age-matched pregnant and virgin female Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into two conditions: (1) Control and (2) Stress. Females in the stress condition were restrained during days 5–11 of gestation and at matched time-points in virgin females. All pregnant females received an injection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) on day 1 of gestation and were sacrificed 21 days later. The same procedure was carried out at matched time points in virgin females. Results show that for number of Ki67-immunoreactive (ir) cells and doublecortin (DCX)-ir cells, there were significant interactions between reproductive state (pregnant/virgin) and stress exposure (p = .05, p = .04, respectively) with control virgin and stressed pregnant females having more Ki67-ir cells than control pregnant females and more DCX-ir cells than stressed virgin females. Results also show that pregnant females had significantly greater glucocorticoid receptor (GR) density in the CA1, CA3 and granule cell layer compared to virgin females. In addition, there was a main effect of stress on GR density in the CA3 region, with stressed females having significantly lower GR density compared to control females (p = .01). This work adds to our understanding of how stress and reproductive state affect plasticity in the female hippocampus.

AB  - Abstract
Creativity is the production of novel ideas that have value. Previous research indicated that while regions in the right hemisphere are implicated in the production of new ideas, damage to the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) is associated with increased creativity, indicating that the left IFG damage may have a “releasing” effect on creativity. To examine this, in the present study we used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to modulate activity of the right and the left IFG. In the first experiment we show that whereas anodal tDCS over the right IFG coupled with cathodal tDCS over the left IFG increases creativity as measured by a verbal divergent thinking task, the reverse stimulation does not affect creative production. To further confirm that only altering the balance between the two hemispheres is crucial in modulating creativity, in the second experiment we show that stimulation targeting separately the left IFG (cathodal stimulation) or the right IFG (anodal stimulation) did not result in changes in creativity as measured by verbal divergent thinking. These findings support the balance hypothesis, according to which verbal creativity requires a balance of activation between the right and the left frontal lobes, and more specifically, between the right and the left IFG.

AB  - Abstract
Menopause can cause cognitive decline. Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is the most effective treatment for the climacteric symptoms. However, its cognitive effect has not been well clarified, especially for the progestin component. The study investigated the effects of dydrogesterone (DG) on spatial learning and memory of the ovariectomized (OVX) rat models and the impact of aging on its cognitive effects. Eighty female Sprague–Dawley rats were included in the experiment. They belonged to two cohorts, the adult (7 months) and the aged (18 months). Each cohort was divided into five groups: Sham, OVX, OVX + E2 (OVX + 17β-estrogen), OVX + E2/DG and OVX + DG. The replacement therapy lasted for 20 weeks. Two classical behavioral tests were performed: open field test (OFT) and the Morris water maze (MWM). The breast morphology and uterine weight were obtained to assess the safety and complication of dydrogesterone. In MWM, the OVX group displayed prolonged latency and less target quadrant time than the other groups. Across 5 days’ testing, all the adult groups receiving hormone therapy, except the OVX + DG group, performed better than the OVX group (P &lt; 0.001); but there was no significant difference among the aged groups. The uterus weight/body weight ratio of OVX + E2/DG group was lower than the sham and OVX + E2 group. The mammary glands of OVX + E2/DG group displayed normal structure or mild hyperplasia. The results suggested that DG-alone treatment had no significant benefit for the OVX rats of both adult and aged groups on the behavioral tests. DG combined with E2 could ameliorate cognition in adult rats with uterus protection and without breast harm. The cognitive-improve effects were more remarkable for the adult rats than the aged ones. The findings support the potential clinical application of dydrogesterone combined with estrogen in preventing cognitive decline, especially for the early iatrogenic menopausal women.

Post-mitotic neurons are particularly susceptible to DNA double-strand breaks during their relatively long lifespan. Here, we report the anatomical distribution and subcellular localization of a molecule first identified as a DNA damage checkpoint protein. Immunocytochemical analysis of 53BP1 showed that this nuclear molecule is widely expressed in adult human and rat brains. Further, we showed that 53BP1 routinely co-clusters with γ-aminobutyric acid neurons throughout the rat neuraxis. Notably, 53BP1 is only expressed in neuronal cells as the DNA damage checkpoint protein was virtually absent from glial cells. Finally, we found that human neural progenitors showed a differential index of DNA fragmentation at different stages of cellular differentiation. These data provide additional and important anatomical findings for the distribution and phenotype of DNA double-strand breaks in the mammalian brain, and suggest that DNA fragmentation is a spontaneous event routinely occurring in neural progenitors and adult neurons.

AB  - AbstractPurpose
This study aimed to clarify whether ischemia-induced early growth response 1 (EGR1) influenced the outcomes of experimental stroke by regulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression.
Methods and results
To mimic ischemia, mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion, and neurons challenged with oxygen–glucose deprivation. The expression of EGR1 was increased immediately and reached the peak 24 h after reperfusion. To increase and to decrease EGR1 expressions, two types of recombinant lentiviruses were constructed. EGR1 over-expression induced by recombinant lentiviruses expanded infarct volumes and increased the numbers of terminal deoxynucleoitidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and Fluoro-Jade C-positive cells; while decreased EGR1 expression induced by recombinant lentiviruses diminished infarct volumes and decreased the numbers of TUNEL- and Fluoro-Jade C-positive cells. Both in vitro and in vivo, increasing EGR1 expression with recombinant lentiviruses lead to decreased BDNF expressions; while silencing EGR1 expression with recombinant lentiviruses lead to increased BDNF expressions. Results from electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicated that EGR1 influenced the BDNF expression by binding to its promoter.
Conclusion
Ischemia-induced EGR1 expression may exaggerate brain injury by reducing BDNF expression. Inhibiting EGR1 may become a potential treatment for improving outcomes of ischemic stroke.

AB  - Abstract
Imagery and perception are thought to be tightly linked, however, little is known about the interaction between imagery and the vestibular sense, in particular, self-motion perception. In this study, the observers were seated in the dark on a motorized chair that could rotate either to the right or to the left. Prior to the physical rotation, observers were asked to imagine themselves rotating leftward or rightward. We found that if the direction of imagined rotation was different to the physical rotation of the chair (incongruent trials), the velocity of the chair needed to be higher for observers to experience themselves rotating relative to when the imagined and the physical rotation matched (on congruent trials). Accordingly, the vividness of imagined rotations was reduced on incongruent relative to congruent trials. Notably, we found that similar effects of imagery were found at the earliest stages of vestibular processing, namely, the onset of the vestibular–ocular reflex was modulated by the congruency between physical and imagined rotations. Together, the results demonstrate that mental imagery influences self-motion perception by exerting top-down influences over the earliest vestibular response and subsequent perceptual decision-making.

The opioid system is involved in infant–mother bonds and adult–adult bonds in many species. We have previously shown that μ opioid receptors (MORs) and κ opioid receptors (KORs) are involved in regulating the adult attachment of the monogamous titi monkey. The present study sought to determine the distribution of MOR and KOR in the titi monkey brain using receptor autoradiography. We used [3H][D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) to label MORs and [3H]U69,593 to label KORs. MOR binding was heterogeneous throughout the titi monkey brain. Specifically, MOR binding was observed in the cingulate gyrus (CG), striatum, septal regions, diagonal band, amygdala, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and thalamus. Binding was particularly dense in the septum, medial amygdala, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, mediodorsal thalamus with moderate binding in the nucleus accumbens. Consistent with other primate species, MOR were also observed in “neurochemically unique domains of the accumbens and putamen” (NUDAPs). In general KOR binding was more homogenous. KORs were primarily found in the CG, striatum, amygdala and hippocampus. Dense KOR binding was observed in the claustrum. Relative MOR and KOR binding in the titi monkey striatum was similar to other humans and primates, but was much lower compared to rodents. Relative MOR binding in the titi monkey hypothalamus was much greater than that found in rodents. This study was the first to examine MOR and KOR binding in a monogamous primate. The location of these receptors gives insight into where ligands may be acting to regulate social behavior and endocrine function.

AB  - Abstract
Activity and disuse of synapses are thought to influence progression of several neurodegenerative diseases in which synaptic degeneration is an early sign. Here we tested whether stimulation or disuse renders neuromuscular synapses more or less vulnerable to degeneration, using axotomy as a robust trigger. We took advantage of the slow synaptic degeneration phenotype of axotomized neuromuscular junctions in flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) and deep lumbrical (DL) muscles of Wallerian degeneration-Slow (WldS) mutant mice. First, we maintained ex vivo FDB and DL nerve-muscle explants at 32 °C for up to 48 h. About 90% of fibers from WldS mice remained innervated, compared with about 36% in wild-type muscles at the 24-h checkpoint. Periodic high-frequency nerve stimulation (100 Hz: 1 s/100 s) reduced synaptic protection in WldS preparations by about 50%. This effect was abolished in reduced Ca2+ solutions. Next, we assayed FDB and DL innervation after 7 days of complete tetrodotoxin (TTX)-block of sciatic nerve conduction in vivo, followed by tibial nerve axotomy. Five days later, only about 9% of motor endplates remained innervated in the paralyzed muscles, compared with about 50% in 5 day-axotomized muscles from saline-control-treated WldS mice with no conditioning nerve block. Finally, we gave mice access to running wheels for up to 4 weeks prior to axotomy. Surprisingly, exercising WldS mice ad libitum for 4 weeks increased about twofold the amount of subsequent axotomy-induced synaptic degeneration. Together, the data suggest that vulnerability of mature neuromuscular synapses to axotomy, a potent neurodegenerative trigger, may be enhanced bimodally, either by disuse or by hyperactivity.

AB  - Abstract
An earlier study has demonstrated that exogenous allopregnanolone (APα) can reverse the reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of 3-month-old male triple transgenic Alzheimer’s disease mouse (3xTgAD). This paper is focused on further clarifying the origin of these new-born TH-positive neurons induced by exogenous APα treatment. We performed a deeper research in another AD mouse model, 4-month-old male APPswe/PSEN1 double transgenic AD mouse (2xTgAD) by measuring APα concentration and counting immunopositive neurons using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and unbiased stereology. It was found that endogenous APα level and the number of TH-positive neurons were reduced in the 2xTgAD mice, and these reductions were present prior to the appearance of β-amyloid (Aβ)-positive plaques. Furthermore, a single 20 mg/kg of exogenous APα treatment prevented the decline of total neurons, TH-positive neurons and TH/bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) double-positive neurons in the SNpc of 2xTgAD mice although the decreased intensity of TH-positive fibers was not rescued in the striatum. It was also noted that exogenous APα administration had an apparent increase in the doublecortin (DCX)-positive neurons and DCX/BrdU double-positive neurons of subventricular zone (SVZ), as well as in the percentage of neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN)/BrdU double-positive neurons of the SNpc in the 2xTgAD mice. These findings indicate that a lower level of endogenous APα is implicated in the loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons in the 2xTgAD mice, and exogenous APα-induced a significant increase in the new-born dopaminergic neurons might be derived from the proliferating and differentiation of neural stem niche of SVZ.

AB  - Abstract
Estrogen receptor-related receptor-α (ERRα) is an orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily that interacts with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) to stimulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and angiogenesis in a hypoxia-inducible factor-1α-independent pathway. Although it is not regulated by any natural ligand, the action of ERRα can be blocked by the synthetic molecule XCT790. In the present study, Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly allocated to a sham group, injury-saline group or injury-XCT90 group. A modified Allen’s weight-drop method was applied to induce the acute traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) model in these rats, and an injection of XCT790 was administered every 24 h, starting half an hour after the SCI contusion. Histological analyses revealed that XCT790 significantly aggravated tissue damage and decreased the number of ERRα-positive cells at 1, 3 and 7 days after SCI. Western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses also indicated that XCT790 dramatically repressed the expression of ERRα, thus reducing the expression of VEGF and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) throughout the duration of the experiment, but the expression of PGC-1α was not affected. Immunofluorescence analyses indicated that vascular density and endothelial cell proliferation were decreased in the injury-XCT90 group compared with the injury-saline group. These results suggest that ERRα is involved in mediating angiogenesis after SCI in the rat traumatic SCI model.

AB  - Abstract
Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a model of multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammatory, demyelinating and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Clinically manifested EAE can be induced in Dark Agouti (DA) rats, but not in Albino Oxford (AO) rats by immunization with spinal cord homogenate (SCH) and complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) play important roles in various steps of MS and EAE pathogenesis. Expression of gelatinases MMP2 and MMP9, their activator MMP14 and their inhibitor tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)1 in the CNS of AO and DA rats immunized with SCH + CFA was determined. Expression of mRNA for MMP2, MMP9 and MMP14 was higher and expression of TIMP1 mRNA was lower in AO rats. However, gelatinase activity in spinal cords was higher in samples obtained from DA rats. Further, while there was no strain difference in MMP2 and MMP9 mRNA expression in lymph nodes of the immunized rats, gelatinase activity was higher in DA rats. This activity was reduced by antiinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-4. Interestingly, gelatinase activity was detected in the nuclei of cells within the CNS, but not of those in lymph nodes. Our results imply that posttranscriptional regulation of MMP2 and MMP9 expression and/or function determines low gelatinase activity within the CNS and in immune cells of EAE-resistant AO rats.

AB  - Abstract
Dry eye (DE) disease is commonly associated with ocular surface inflammation, an unstable tear film and symptoms of irritation. However, little is known about the role of central neural mechanisms in DE. This study used a model for persistent aqueous tear deficiency, exorbital gland removal, to assess the effects of mustard oil (MO), a transient receptor potential ankyrin (TRPA1) agonist, on eyeblink and eyewipe behavior and Fos-like immunoreactivity (Fos-LI) in the trigeminal brainstem of male rats. Spontaneous tear secretion was reduced by about 50% and spontaneous eyeblinks were increased more than 100% in DE rats compared to sham rats. MO (0.02–0.2%) caused dose-related increases in eyeblink and forelimb eyewipe behavior in DE and sham rats. Exorbital gland removal alone was sufficient to increase Fos-LI at the ventrolateral pole of trigeminal interpolaris/caudalis (Vi/Vc) transition region, but not at more caudal regions of the trigeminal brainstem. Under barbiturate anesthesia ocular surface application of MO (2–20%) produced Fos-LI in the Vi/Vc transition, in the mid-portions of Vc and in the trigeminal caudalis/upper cervical spinal cord (Vc/C1) region that was significantly greater in DE rats than in sham controls. MO caused an increase in Fos-LI ipsilaterally in superficial laminae at the mid-Vc and Vc/C1 regions in a dose-dependent manner. Smaller, but significant, increases in Fos-LI also were seen in the contralateral Vc/C1 region in DE rats. TRPA1 protein levels in trigeminal ganglia from DE rats ipsilateral and contralateral to gland removal were similar.

Persistent tear reduction enhanced the behavioral and trigeminal brainstem neural responses to ocular surface stimulation by MO. These results suggested that TRPA1 mechanisms play a significant role in the sensitization of ocular-responsive trigeminal brainstem neurons in this model for tear deficient DE.

AB  - Abstract
In mice, 249 putative members of the superfamily of EF-hand domain Ca2+-binding proteins, manifesting great diversity in structure, cellular localization and functions have been identified. Three members in particular, namely, calbindin-D28K, calretinin and parvalbumin, are widely used as markers for specific neuronal subpopulations in different regions of the brain. The aim of the present study was to compile a comprehensive atlas of the gene-expression profiles of the entire EF-hand gene superfamily in the murine brain. This was achieved by a meticulous examination of the in-situ hybridization images in the Allen Brain Atlas database. Topographically, our analysis focused on the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex (barrel cortex in the primary somatosensory area), basal ganglia, hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, midbrain, pons and medulla, and on clearly identifiable sub-structures within each of these areas. The expression profiles of four family-members, namely hippocalcin-like 4, neurocalcin-δ, plastin 3 and tescalcin, that have not been hitherto reported, at either the mRNA (in-situ-hybridization) or the protein (immunohistochemical) levels, are now presented for the first time. The fruit of our analysis is a document in which the gene-expression profiles of all members of the EF-hand family genes are compared, and in which future possible neuronal markers for specific cells/brain areas are identified. The assembled information could afford functional clues to investigators, conducive to further experimental pursuit.

AB  - Abstract
The brain astrocyte glycogen reservoir is a vital energy reserve and, in the cerebral cortex, subject among other factors to noradrenergic control. The ovarian steroid estradiol potently stimulates nerve cell aerobic respiration, but its role in glial glycogen metabolism during energy homeostasis or mismatched substrate supply/demand is unclear. This study examined the premise that estradiol regulates hypothalamic astrocyte glycogen metabolic enzyme protein expression during normo- and hypoglycemia in vivo through dorsomedial hindbrain catecholamine (CA)-dependent mechanisms. Individual astrocytes identified in situ by glial fibrillary acidic protein immunolabeling were laser-microdissected from the ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH), arcuate hypothalamic (ARH), and paraventricular hypothalamic (PVH) nuclei and the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) of estradiol (E)- or oil (O)-implanted ovariectomized (OVX) rats after insulin or vehicle injection, and pooled within each site. Stimulation [VMH, LHA] or suppression [PVH, ARH] of basal glycogen synthase (GS) protein expression by E was reversed in the former three sites by caudal fourth ventricular pretreatment with the CA neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). E diminished glycogen phosphorylase (GP) protein profiles by CA-dependent [VMH, PVH] or -independent mechanisms [LHA]. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia (IIH) increased GS expression in the PVH in OVX + E, but reduced this protein in the PVH, ARH, and LHA in OVX + O. Moreover, IIH augmented GP expression in the VMH, LHA, and ARH in OVX + E and in the ARH in OVX + O, responses that normalized by 6-OHDA. Results demonstrate site-specific effects of E on astrocyte glycogen metabolic enzyme expression in the female rat hypothalamus, and identify locations where dorsomedial hindbrain CA input is required for such action. Evidence that E correspondingly increases and reduces basal GS and GP in the VMH and LHA, but augments the latter protein during IIH suggests that E regulates glycogen content and turnover in these structures during glucose sufficiency and shortage.

AB  - Abstract
Healthy aging is accompanied by neurobiological changes that affect the brain’s functional organization and the individual’s cognitive abilities. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of global age-related differences in the cortical white and gray matter on neural activity in three key large-scale networks. We used functional–structural covariance network analysis to assess resting state activity in the default mode network (DMN), the fronto-parietal network (FPN), and the salience network (SN) of young and older adults. We further related this functional activity to measures of cortical thickness and volume derived from structural MRI, as well as to measures of white matter integrity (fractional anisotropy [FA], mean diffusivity [MD], and radial diffusivity [RD]) derived from diffusion-weighted imaging. First, our results show that, in the direct comparison of resting state activity, young but not older adults reliably engage the SN and FPN in addition to the DMN, suggesting that older adults recruit these networks less consistently. Second, our results demonstrate that age-related decline in white matter integrity and gray matter volume is associated with activity in prefrontal nodes of the SN and FPN, possibly reflecting compensatory mechanisms. We suggest that age-related differences in gray and white matter properties differentially affect the ability of the brain to engage and coordinate large-scale functional networks that are central to efficient cognitive functioning.

AB  - AbstractBackground
Interleukin-23 (IL-23) is required for T helper 17 (Th17) cell responses and IL-17 production in ischemic stroke. We previously showed that the IL-23/IL-17 axis aggravates immune injury after cerebral infarction in mice. However, IL-23 might activate other cytokines and transcription factor forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) production in cerebral ischemia. We aimed to determine whether IL-23p19 knockdown prevents cerebral ischemic injury by reducing ischemic-induced inflammation.
Methods
Ischemic stroke models were established by permanent middle cerebral arterial occlusion (pMCAO) in male C57BL/6 mice. In vivo gene knockdown was achieved by intravenous delivery of lentiviral vectors (LVs) encoding IL-23p19 short hairpin RNA (LV-IL-23p19 shRNA). Enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) confirmed inhibitory efficiency. Behavioral deficits were evaluated by adhesive-removal somatic-sensory test. Brain infarct volume was measured at day 5 after pMCAO by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Expression of IL-17, IL-4, interferon (IFN)-γ and Foxp3 in ischemic brain tissues were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Additionally, immunohistochemical staining located cytokines in ischemic brain tissues.
Results
RNA interference knockdown of IL-23p19 resulted in improved neurological function and reduced infarct volume. IL-23p19 knockdown suppressed IL-17 gene and protein expression. Moreover, IL-23p19 deficiency enhanced IFN-γ and Foxp3 expressions in delayed cerebral ischemic mice, and did not impact IL-4 expression. Immunohistochemical staining showed that IL-17, IL-4, IFN-γ and Foxp3-positive cells were located around ischemic lesions of the ipsilateral hemisphere.
Conclusions
IL-23p19 knockdown prevents delayed cerebral ischemic injury by dampening the ischemia-induced inflammation, and is a promising approach for clinically managing ischemic stroke.

AB  - Abstract
Modulation of dopamine (DA) released by serotonin-2 (5-HT2) receptors has been implicated in the mechanism of action of antipsychotic drugs. The mesocortical DA system has been implicated particularly in the cognitive deficits observed in schizophrenia. Agonism at 5-HT2A receptors in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is associated with increases in cortical DA release. Evidence indicates that 5-HT2A receptors in the cortex regulate mesocortical DA release through stimulation of a “long-loop” feedback system from the PFC to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and back. However, a causal role for VTA glutamate in the 5-HT2-induced increases in PFC DA has not been established. The present study does so by measuring 5-HT2 agonist-induced DA release in the cortex after infusions of glutamate antagonists into the VTA of the rat. Infusions of a combination of a N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) (AP-5: 2-amino-5-phosphopentanoic acid) and an AMPA/kainate (CNQX: 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione) receptor antagonist into the VTA blocked the increases in cortical DA produced by administration of the 5-HT2 agonist DOI [(±)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine] (2.5 mg/kg s.c.). These results demonstrate that stimulation of glutamate receptors in the VTA is necessary for 5-HT2 agonist-induced increases in cortical DA.

AB  - Abstract
Cannabinoids (CBs) have recently been approved to exert broad anti-inflammatory activities in experimental models of multiple sclerosis (MS). It has been demonstrated that these compounds could also have effects on neurodegeneration, demyelination, and autoimmune processes occurring in the pathology of MS. However, the clinical use of CBs is limited by their psychoactive effects. Among cannabinoid compounds, cannabidiol (CBD) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) have no psychotropic activities. We induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS, by injecting myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) to C57BL/6 mice. We assessed the effects of CBD, PEA, and co-administration of CBD and PEA on neurobehavioral scores, immune cell infiltration, demyelination, axonal injury, and the expression of inflammatory cytokines by using histochemistry methods and real-time RT-PCR. Treatment with either CBD (5 mg/kg) or PEA (5 mg/kg) during disease onset reduced the severity of the neurobehavioral scores of EAE. This effect of CBD and PEA was accompanied by diminished inflammation, demyelination, axonal damage and inflammatory cytokine expression while concurrent administration of CBD (5 mg/kg) and PEA (5 mg/kg) was not as effective as treatment with either drug per se. These results suggest that, CBD and PEA, non-psychoactive CBs, attenuate neurobehavioral deficits, histological damage, and inflammatory cytokine expression in MOG-immunized animals. However, there is an antagonistic interaction between CBD and PEA in protection against MOG-induced disease.

AB  - Abstract
Reelin is an extracellular matrix protein that plays a critical role in neuronal guidance during brain neurodevelopment and in synaptic plasticity in adults and has been associated with schizophrenia. Reelin mRNA and protein levels are reduced in various structures of post-mortem schizophrenic brains, in a similar way to those found in heterozygous reeler mice (HRM). Reelin is involved in protein expression in dendritic spines that are the major location where synaptic connections are established. Thus, we hypothesized that a genetic deficit in reelin would affect the expression and function of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors that are associated with the action of current antipsychotic drugs.

In this study, D2 and 5-HT2A receptor expression and function were quantitated by using radioligand binding studies in the frontal cortex and striatum of HRM and wild-type mice (WTM). We observed increased expression (p &lt; 0.05) in striatum membranes and decreased expression (p &lt; 0.05) in frontal cortex membranes for both dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors from HRM compared to WTM.

Our results show parallel alterations of D2 and 5-HT2A receptors that are compatible with a possible hetero-oligomeric nature of these receptors. These changes are similar to changes described in schizophrenic patients and provide further support for the suitability of using HRM as a model for studying this disease and the effects of antipsychotic drugs.

Dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism has been shown to trigger the pathophysiology of many neurodegenerative disorders. The present study focuses on the role of one of the two sphingosine kinases, Sphk2 and its metabolite sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Our study indicated a marked down regulation of Sphk2 expression in the substantia nigra region of the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model and in the cellular PD model. Localization studies indicated that Sphk2 was predominantly present in mitochondria, proposing for its potential role in mitochondrial functions. Since mitochondrial dysfunction has been described to be the major pathological event in PD, the present study focused on the role of Sphk2/S1P signaling in promoting mitochondrial functions in the MPTP-induced mouse model of PD and in 1-methyl-4 phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-treated MN9D cells. Our study demonstrated that inhibition of Sphk2 decreased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) and its downstream targets nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) which are the key genes regulating mitochondrial function. In addition, there was also a significant reduction in the total cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD 2) with an associated increase in levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the absence of Sphk2. Interestingly, it was found that treating the cells with exogenous S1P along with MPP+ exerted a neuroprotective effect by activation of p-CREB, PGC-1α and NRF-1 in the MN9D cells. Moreover, the level of ATP was unaffected in the MPP+-treated cells in the presence of S1P. It was also observed that levels of ROS were significantly decreased in the MPP+-treated cells in the presence of exogenous S1P. Our study also demonstrated that S1P exerted its protective effect through the S1P1 receptor. Taken together, these results show that Sphk2/S1P has an important role to play in the survival of the dopaminergic neurons, in the pathogenesis of PD.

AB  - Abstract
Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 1 (HCN1) and 2 (HCN2) are abundantly expressed in primary sensory neurons and contribute to neuronal excitability and pathological pain. We studied the expression of HCN1 and HCN2 in the rat trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons and axons in the dental pulp, and the changes in their expression following inflammation, using light- and electron-microscopic immunocytochemistry and quantitative analysis.

HCN1 and HCN2 were expressed predominantly in large-sized, neurofilament 200-immunopositive (+) or parvalbumin+ soma in the TG whereas they were expressed mostly in unmyelinated and small myelinated axons in the sensory root. The expression was particularly strong along the plasma membrane in the soma. In the dental pulp, majority of HCN1+ and HCN2+ axons coexpressed calcitonin gene-related peptide. They were expressed mainly in the peripheral pulp and pulp horn where the axons branch extensively in the dental pulp. The expression of HCN1 and HCN2 in TG neurons increased significantly in rats with experimentally induced inflammation of the dental pulp.

Our findings support the notion that HCN1 and HCN2 are expressed mainly by both the soma of mechanosensitive neurons in the TG and peripheral axons of nociceptive neurons in the sensory root, and may play a role in the mechanisms of inflammatory pain from the dental pulp.

AB  - Abstract
This study compared the timing of appearance of three components of age-related hearing loss that determine the pattern and severity of presbycusis: the functional and structural pathologies of sensory cells and neurons and changes in gap detection (GD), the latter as an indicator of auditory temporal processing. Using UM-HET4 mice, genetically heterogeneous mice derived from four inbred strains, we studied the integrity of inner and outer hair cells by position along the cochlear spiral, inner hair cell–auditory nerve connections, spiral ganglion neurons (SGN), and determined auditory thresholds, as well as pre-pulse and gap inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex (ASR). Comparisons were made between mice of 5–7, 22–24 and 27–29 months of age. There was individual variability among mice in the onset and extent of age-related auditory pathology.

At 22–24 months of age a moderate to large loss of outer hair cells was restricted to the apical third of the cochlea and threshold shifts in the auditory brain stem response were minimal. There was also a large and significant loss of inner hair cell–auditory nerve connections and a significant reduction in GD. The expression of Ntf3 in the cochlea was significantly reduced. At 27–29 months of age there was no further change in the mean number of synaptic connections per inner hair cell or in GD, but a moderate to large loss of outer hair cells was found across all cochlear turns as well as significantly increased ABR threshold shifts at 4, 12, 24 and 48 kHz.

A statistical analysis of correlations on an individual animal basis revealed that neither the hair cell loss nor the ABR threshold shifts correlated with loss of GD or with the loss of connections, consistent with independent pathological mechanisms.

In this study, a novel TRI (triple reuptake inhibitors) antidepressant candidate RO-05 (4-[1-[1-(benzoyloxy)cyclohexyl]-2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-phenyl benzoate) was investigated in TST (tail suspension test), FST (forced swimming test) and CMS (chronic mild stress) model. Results showed RO-05 significantly decreased the immobility time in FST and TST at 4.5-, 9-, 18-mg/kg in rats and 9-, 18-, 36-mg/kg in mice. Chronic administration of 18-mg/kg RO-05 improved the behavioral index, anhedonia and normalized the hyperactivity of HPA (hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis) of CMS rats. We further investigated the possible mechanisms of RO-05 in the CMS model. Eighteen milligrams per kilogram of RO-05 chronic administration significantly reversed the increase of mRNA and protein expression of FKBP5 in the CMS rat hippocampus, which facilitated the activation of GR- (glucocorticoid receptor) and GR-responsive gene Foxo1 expression. RO-05 also elevated the expression of BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) in CMS rat hippocampus. In summary, our results indicated that RO-05 is a promising antidepressant candidate. The possible antidepressant mechanisms of RO-05 were the modulation of FKBP5 expression, GR activation, corresponding inhibition of HPA axis hyperactivity, and the increase of BDNF expression.

AB  - Abstract
The strength of synaptic transmission between a neuron and multiple postsynaptic partners can vary considerably. We have studied synaptic heterogeneity using the glutamatergic Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ), which contains multiple synaptic connections of varying strengths between a motor axon and muscle fiber. In larval NMJs, there is a gradient of synaptic transmission from weak proximal to strong distal boutons. We imaged synaptic transmission with the postsynaptically targeted fluorescent calcium sensor SynapCam, to investigate the molecular pathways that determine synaptic strength and set up this gradient. We discovered that mutations in the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway disrupt production of strong distal boutons. We find that strong connections contain unbundled microtubules in the boutons, suggesting a role for microtubule organization in transmission strength. The spastin mutation, which disorganizes microtubules, disrupted the transmission gradient, supporting this interpretation. We propose that the BMP pathway, shown previously to function in the homeostatic regulation of synaptic growth, also boosts synaptic transmission in a spatially selective manner that depends on the microtubule system.

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is activated by oxidative stress and plays an important role in traumatic brain injury (TBI). The objective of this study was to investigate whether PARP activation participated in the blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption and edema formation in a mouse model of controlled cortical impact (CCI). N-(6-oxo-5,6-dihydrophenanthridin-2-yl)-N,N-dimethylacetamide (PJ34) (10 mg/kg), a selective PARP inhibitor, was administered intraperitoneally at 5 min and 8 h after experimental CCI. After 6 h and 24 h of CCI, the permeability of the cortical BBB was determined after Evans Blue administration. The water content of the brain was also measured. Treatment with PJ34 markedly attenuated the permeability of the BBB and decreased the brain edema at 6 h and 24 h after CCI. Our data showed the up-regulation of nuclear factor-κB in cytosolic fractions and nuclear fractions in the injured cortex, and these changes were reversed by PJ34. Moreover, PJ34 significantly lessened the activities of myeloperoxidase and the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9, enhanced the levels of occludin, laminin, collagen IV and integrin β1, reduced neurological deficits, decreased the contusion volume, and attenuated the necrotic and apoptotic neuronal cell death. These data suggest the protective effects of PJ34 on BBB integrity and cell death during acute TBI.

AB  - Abstract
We previously showed that isovaline is a peripheral analgesic which acts in vivo and in brain slices as an atypical metabotropic GABAB agonist. Peripheral inhibitory group II and III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) belong to the same family C as GABAB receptors; therefore, we hypothesized that isovaline’s analgesic effects could include their activation. We examined the effects of R-isovaline on mechanical allodynia produced by prostaglandin E2 in the mouse paw. Subcutaneous R-isovaline produced dose-dependent antiallodynia restricted to the injected hindlimb. This antiallodynia was blocked by co-injection with a selective group II mGluR antagonist, LY341495, but not a group III mGluR antagonist (MAP-4). The antiallodynic effect of R-isovaline was potentiated by co-administration of a group II mGluR-positive allosteric modulator, LY487379. Injection of a group II mGluR agonist (LY354740) produced an antiallodynic effect which was completely reversed by group II antagonism, but was not affected by group III or GABAB (CGP35348) antagonism. Similarly, group II mGluR antagonism did not alter the antiallodynia produced by the prototypical GABAB agonist, baclofen. Hence, there was no apparent crosstalk between group II mGluRs and GABAB receptors. Previous studies have demonstrated that peripheral GABAB receptor activation by isovaline produces antiallodynia. In addition, the present results indicate that activation of peripheral group II mGluRs by R-isovaline produces antiallodynia.

Simvastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor commonly used in the clinic to treat hypercholesterolemia. In addition, simvastatin has been shown to cross the blood–brain barrier and pleiotropic effects of simvastatin have been reported including anti-inflammatory properties, enhancement of neurite outgrowth, and memory enhancement properties. However, little has been reported on the effects of simvastatin on basal synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. Here we report that simvastatin increases the fEPSP, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated fEPSP using extracellular recordings in the dendritic region of the CA1 of hippocampal slices taken from 8-week-old C57Black6J mice. In addition, we found that simvastatin perfusion causes a change in the input/output curve and a decrease of the paired-pulse facilitation ratio, indicating respectively an increase of the neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release. We have also observed that acute application of simvastatin increased the amplitude of the compound action potential in the CA1 region. Notably, using LY294002, we have demonstrated that this effect was PI3K dependent and was occluded if the animals had previously received a diet supplemented with simvastatin. We have finally shown that the simvastatin-mediated increase of the compound action potential amplitude was also present in hippocampal slices from aged mice.

AB  - Abstract
Background and purpose: In vivo imaging of inflammatory processes is a valuable tool in stroke research. We here investigated the combination of two imaging modalities in the chronic phase after cerebral ischemia: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using intravenously applied ultra small supraparamagnetic iron oxide particles (USPIO), and positron emission tomography (PET) with the tracer [11C]PK11195. Methods: Rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) by the macrosphere model and monitored by MRI and PET for 28 or 56 days, followed by immunohistochemical endpoint analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first study providing USPIO-MRI data in the chronic phase up to 8 weeks after stroke. Results: Phagocytes with internalized USPIOs induced MRI-T2∗ signal alterations in the brain. Combined analysis with [11C]PK11195-PET allowed quantification of phagocytic activity and other neuroinflammatory processes. From 4 weeks after induction of ischemia, inflammation was dominated by phagocytes. Immunohistochemistry revealed colocalization of Iba1+ microglia with [11C]PK11195 and ED1/CD68 with USPIOs. USPIO-related iron was distinguished from alternatively deposited iron by assessing MRI before and after USPIO application. Tissue affected by non-phagocytic inflammation during the first week mostly remained in a viably vital but remodeled state after 4 or 8 weeks, while phagocytic activity was associated with severe injury and necrosis accordingly. Conclusions: We conclude that the combined approach of USPIO-MRI and [11C]PK11195-PET allows to observe post-stroke inflammatory processes in the living animal in an intraindividual and longitudinal fashion, predicting long-term tissue fate. The non-invasive imaging methods do not affect the immune system and have been applied to human subjects before. Translation into clinical applications is therefore feasible.

AB  - Abstract
Migration of postmitotic neurons in the developing cortex along radial glial fiber is essential for the formation of cortical layers. Several neurological diseases are caused by defects in neuronal migration, underlining the importance of this process for brain function. Multiple molecules are involved in this process. However, the precise mechanisms are largely unknown. In the present study, we examined the expression of Src in the developing cortex and investigated the role of Src in neuronal migration and its cellular and molecular mechanisms. Our results showed that Src was strongly expressed in the cerebral cortex during corticogenesis and mainly targeted to the leading processes of migrating neurons. Overexpression of wildtype Src (Src-WT) and its mutants, constitutively active Src (Src-CA) and dominant negative Src (Src-DN) in the mouse brain by in utero electroporation perturbed neuronal migration through affecting the adhesion properties and cytoskeletal dynamics of migrating neurons. Overexpression of Src-WT and Src-CA induced aggregation and branching of migrating neurons, whereas overexpression of Src-DN led to abnormal elongation of the leading processes of migrating neurons. Furthermore, we showed that Src activates the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and cofilin by regulating their phosphorylation levels. We conclude that Src controls neuronal migration by regulating adhesion properties and F-actin dynamics of migrating neurons.

AB  - AbstractObjective
To measure changes in amplitudes of vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) elicited from neck, upper and lower limb muscles during a quiet standing task with increased postural threat achieved by manipulating surface height. Methods: Twenty eight subjects were tested while standing on a platform raised to 0.8 m and 3.2 m from the ground. Surface electromyography was recorded from the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid (SCM), biceps brachii (BB), flexor carpi radialis (FCR), soleus (SOL) and medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscles. Stimulation was with air-conducted short tone bursts (4 ms). After controlling for background muscle activity, VEMP amplitudes were compared between heights and correlated with changes in state anxiety, fear and arousal. Results: VEMP amplitude significantly increased in SCM (9%) and SOL (12.7%) with increased surface height (p &lt; 0.05). These modest increases in SCM VEMP amplitude were significantly correlated with anxiety (Rho = 0.57, p = 0.004) and confidence (Rho = −0.38, p = 0.047) and those for SOL were significantly correlated with anxiety (Rho = 0.33, p = 0.049) and fear (Rho = 0.36, p = 0.037). Conclusion: Postural threat significantly increased vestibulospinal reflex (VSR) gains. Results demonstrate that VEMPs can be used to test different VSR pathways simultaneously during stance. Since fear and anxiety are prevalent with vestibular disorders, they should be considered as potential contributing factors for clinical vestibular outcome measures.

AB  - Abstract
“Metaplasticity” is defined as an alteration of synaptic plasticity properties or mechanisms by a priming event without actual changes in synaptic strength. For example, visual discrimination training of rats leads to a facilitation of the subsequent induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) between the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the primary visual cortex (V1). Here, rats received visual discrimination training in a modified water maze, with one eye occluded during training to create monocular viewing conditions; 63% of rats acquired the task under these conditions. Following training, in vivo electrophysiology was used to examine LTP of field postsynaptic potentials (fPSPs) in V1 elicited by LGN stimulation. Rats that had successfully learned the task showed significantly greater LTP in the “trained V1” (contralateral to the open, trained eye) relative to the “untrained” hemisphere. Rats that underwent training but failed to acquire the task did not show this lateralized plasticity enhancement and had similar levels of LTP in both cerebral hemispheres. Cortical application of the NMDA receptor–GluN2B subunit antagonist Ro 25-6981 (2 mM) reversed the training-induced LTP facilitation without affecting LTP in the untrained V1. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings of V1 (layers II/III) pyramidal cells in vitro demonstrated that pharmacologically isolated NMDA currents exhibit a greater sensitivity to GluN2B blockade in the trained relative to the untrained V1. Together, these experiments reveal a surprising degree of anatomical (only in the hemisphere contralateral to the trained eye) and behavioral specificity (only in rats that mastered the task) for the effect of visual training to enhance LTP in V1. Further, cortical GluN2B subunits appear to be directly involved in this metaplastic facilitation of thalamocortical plasticity, suggesting that NMDA subunit composition or functioning is, at least in part, regulated by the exposure to behaviorally significant stimuli in an animal’s sensory environment.

AB  - Abstract
Increasing evidence has suggested that microglia dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of depression. Both classical activation (M1 activation) and alternative activation (M2 activation) may be involved in the process. M1-activated microglia secrete various pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic mediators, which may contribute to the development of depression, while M2-activated microglia promote tissue reconstruction by releasing anti-inflammatory cytokines involved in the process of depression. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first-line treatments for depression, and their effects on immune system modulation have recently gained attention. Several studies have suggested that SSRIs affect the M1 activation of microglia, but results have varied. In addition, little is known about the effect of SSRIs on M2 activation in depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of fluoxetine and S-citalopram, two widely used SSRIs in clinical, on both the M1 and M2 activation of microglia (the murine BV2 cell line and mouse primary microglia cell). The indexes of activation were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot. The present results showed that both fluoxetine and S-citalopram significantly down-regulated the indexes of M1 activation and up-regulated the M2 activation indexes on mRNA and protein levels either in cell line or primary cells. Taken together, the results suggested that fluoxetine and S-citalopram modulated the immune system by inhibiting M1 activation and by improving M2 activation of microglia and that the immune system modulation may partially mediate the therapeutic effects of antidepressant drugs-SSRIs.

AB  - Abstract
Motor commands issued by the CNS are based upon memories of past experiences with similar objects, the current state of the hand and arm postures, and sensory input. Thus widespread somatosensory information is available to form precise representations of hand shape on which to base motor commands to match a desired posture or movement. The aim of this study was to examine the extent to which somatosensory information reflecting external influences on independent finger movement is incorporated into the perception of hand shape driving the motor command. To address this issue, a matching task was performed while pairs of fingers in the grasping hand were constrained to move in tandem when grasping familiar objects. The hypothesis was that motor commands would be driven by comparison of the online sensory information from the matching hand to a desired somatosensory state determined by the current somatosensory input from the grasping hand. The results demonstrated that multi-muscle patterns of activation and hand postures were altered with respect to the external constraint on independent finger movement. A secondary aim of this study was to examine the influence of sensory information on the structure of the multi-muscle patterns. The hypothesis was that the same synergies (patterns of activation across muscles) would be used to complete the task but would be rescaled with respect to condition. The results demonstrated that rescaling the patterns of multi-muscle activity from the unconstrained condition could not equivalently represent those from the constrained conditions. Thus it appears that external restriction of independent finger movement was signaled by somatosensory feedback and incorporated into the desired state driving the motor command resulting in selective activation of groups of muscles.

Oxidative stress is believed to be a major factor for the onset of Parkinson’s disease (PD). In this study, we have investigated oxidative status in transgenic Drosophila model of PD. Our results revealed elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) in A30P and A53T α-synuclein PD model flies compared to control. We have demonstrated for the first time the ameliorating potential of natural antioxidants characterized from the roots of Dh in A30P and A53T α-synuclein PD model flies. Feeding of transgenic flies with aqueous Dh root extract for 21 days significantly improved their climbing ability and circadian rhythm of locomotor activity which was associated with reduction in levels of ROS and LPO and enhancement in the activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Dh protected against paraquat (PQ) sensitivity in α-synuclein transgenic flies and delayed the onset of PD-like symptoms which appears to be mediated by suppression of oxidative stress.

AB  - Abstract
Recent data have shown that preservation of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) after traumatic nerve injury helps to improve functional recovery with surgical repair via matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3) blockade. As such, we sought to explore additional pathways that may augment this response. Wnt3a has been shown to inhibit acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering via β-catenin-dependent signaling in the development of the NMJ. Therefore, we hypothesized that Wnt3a and β-catenin are associated with NMJ destabilization following traumatic denervation. A critical size nerve defect was created by excising a 10-mm segment of the sciatic nerve in mice. Denervated muscles were then harvested at multiple time points for immunofluorescence staining, quantitative real-time PCR, and western blot analysis for Wnt3a and β-catenin levels. Moreover, a novel Wnt/β-catenin transgenic reporter mouse line was utilized to support our hypothesis of Wnt activation after traumatic nerve injury. The expression of Wnt3a mRNA was significantly increased by 2 weeks post-injury and remained upregulated for 2 months. Additionally, β-catenin was activated at 2 months post-injury relative to controls. Correspondingly, immunohistochemical analysis of denervated transgenic mouse line TCF/Lef:H2B-GFP muscles demonstrated that the number of GFP-positive cells was increased at the motor endplate band. These collective data support that post-synaptic AChRs destabilize after denervation by a process that involves the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. As such, this pathway serves as a potential therapeutic target to prevent the motor endplate degeneration that occurs following traumatic nerve injury.

AB  - Abstract
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an extremely devastating neurodegenerative disease with an obscure etiology. The amino acid β-N-methyl-l-alanine (BMAA) produced by globally widespread phytoplankton has been implicated in the etiology of human motor neuron diseases. BMAA was recently proven to be present in Baltic Sea food webs, ranging from plankton to larger Baltic Sea organisms, some serving as important food items (fish) for humans. To test whether exposure to BMAA in a Baltic Sea setting is reflected in humans, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from individuals suffering from ALS were analyzed, together with sex- and age-matched individuals not inflicted with ALS. Ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), in conjunction with diagnostic transitions revealed BMAA in three (12%) of the totally 25 Swedish individuals tested, with no preference for those suffering from ALS. The three BMAA-positive samples were all retrieved from the CSF, while BMAA was not detected in the blood. The data show that BMAA, potentially originating from Baltic Sea phytoplankton, may reach the human central nervous system, but does not lend support to the notion that BMAA is resident specifically in ALS-patients. However, while dietary exposure to BMAA may be intermittent and, if so, difficult to detect, our data provide the first demonstration of BMAA in the central nervous system of human individuals ante mortem quantified with UHPLC–MS/MS, and therefore calls for extended research efforts.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic exposure to the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) is known to alter plasticity within hippocampal and amygdalar circuits that mediate fear learning and memory. The purpose of this experiment was to clarify the effects of chronic CORT on Pavlovian fear conditioning, which is dependent on intact hippocampal and amygdalar activity. In particular, we assessed whether the effect of chronic CORT on fear learning and memory is influenced by two factors—the dose of CORT and the order in which rats are tested for freezing to context versus tone cues. Male Long–Evans rats received low-dose CORT (5 mg/kg), high-dose CORT (40 mg/kg), or vehicle injections once daily for 21 days. On day 22, the rats were trained in a fear-conditioning paradigm. On days 23 and 24, the rats were tested for the retrieval of fear memories to context and tone cues in a counterbalanced way—half the rats received context testing on day 23 and then tone testing on day 24 and half the rats received tone testing on day 23 followed by context testing on day 24. Our results revealed dose-dependent effects of CORT on memory retrieval: Rats injected with high-dose CORT froze significantly more than control rats to both context and tone cues regardless of what testing day these cues were presented. However, rats injected with low-dose CORT froze significantly more than control rats to tone cues only. We also found an order effect in that the effects of CORT on freezing were greater on the second day of testing, regardless of whether that testing was to context or tones cues. This order effect may be due to a lack of extinction in the CORT rats. Overall, these results suggest a relationship between stress intensity and testing conditions that should be taken into account when assessing the effect of stress on fear memories.

AB  - Abstract
Interleukin-23/interleukin-23 receptor (IL-23/IL-23R) has been implicated in many inflammatory diseases. Previous research mainly focused on its ability to induce IL-17 production from T cells. However, few studies have investigated its role in cerebral ischemic injury. The aim of our study was to explore the potential effect of IL-23 on cells of the neurovascular unit (NVU) under an oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) condition and the role of IL-23R in IL-23-mediated effect. OGD of primary cells of the NVU and permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) were used to produce experimental stroke in vitro and in vivo, respectively. IL-23 and IL-23R were detected by immunohistochemistry and western blot in pMCAO mice. Metabolic viability of cultured cells was assessed by MTT assay. The cell-associated proteins (Bcl-2, AQP4 and ET-1) were determined by western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immunofluorescence staining and western blot were used to detect the IL-23R expression. The results showed that the expression of IL-23/IL-23R was elevated in pMCAO mice. IL-23 could aggravate neuron damage, astrocyte swelling, and further impair the integrity of blood–brain barrier induced by OGD. In addition, the effect of IL-23 on cells of the NVU is mediated by IL-23R and is likely IL-23R-expression-level dependent. However, there are no such biological properties for the IL-23p19 subunit alone. Our study provides the first evidence that IL-23 has a toxic effect on cells of the NVU under OGD stress, which is mediated by IL-23R. These results not only help us better understand the role of IL-23/IL-23R in brain ischemia, but also provide a potential therapeutic target in stroke.

AB  - Abstract
Corticomuscular coherence (CMC) relates to synchronization between activity in the motor cortex and the muscle activity. The strength of CMC can be affected by motor behavior. In a proof-of-principle study, we examined whether independent of motor output parameters, healthy subjects are able to voluntarily modulate CMC in a neurofeedback paradigm.

Subjects received visual online feedback of their instantaneous CMC strength, which was calculated between an optimized spatial projection of multichannel electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) in an individually defined target frequency range. The neurofeedback training consisted of either increasing or decreasing CMC strength using a self-chosen mental strategy while performing a simple motor task. Evaluation of instantaneous coherence showed that CMC strength was significantly larger when subjects had to increase than when to decrease CMC; this difference between the two task conditions did not depend on motor performance. The exclusion of confounding factors such as motor performance, attention and task complexity in study design provides evidence that subjects were able to voluntarily modify CMC independent of motor output parameters. Additional analysis further strengthened the assumption that the subjects’ response was specifically shaped by the neurofeedback.

In perspective, we suggest that CMC-based neurofeedback could provide a therapeutic approach in clinical conditions, such as motor stroke, where CMC is altered.

AB  - Abstract
Besides motor disturbances, other symptoms found in the early stage of Parkinson’s disease (PD) are deficits in both learning and memory. The nigro-striatal–cortical pathway is affected in this pathology, with this neuronal circuit involved in cognitive processes such as spatial working memory (SWM). However, cognitive dysfunction appears even when the patients are receiving l-DOPA treatment. There is evidence that the dopamine metabolism formed by l-DOPA generates free radicals such as nitric oxide, which may cause damage through the nitrosative stress (NS). The aim of this study was to evaluate both the effects of chronic l-DOPA administration on SWM and the production of NS in rats using an intra-nigral lesion caused by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Post-lesion, the animals were administered orally with l-DOPA/Carbidopa (100-mg/kg) for 20 days. An SWM task in a Morris water maze was conducted post-treatment. Nitrite levels and immunoreactivity of 3-Nitrotyrosine (3-NT), Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS), Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP), and Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) were evaluated in the substantia nigra pars compacta, the dorsal striatum and the medial prefrontal cortex. Our results show that chronic l-DOPA administration in rats with intra-nigral 6-OHDA-lesion caused significant increases in SWM deficit, nitrite levels and the immunoreactivity of 3-NT, iNOS and GFAP in the nigro-striatal–cortical pathway. These facts suggest that as l-DOPA can induce NS in rats with dopaminergic intra-nigral lesion, it could play a key role in the impairment of the SWM, and thus can be considered as a toxic mechanism that induces cognitive deficit in PD patients.

AB  - Abstract
Oxytocin (OT) plays an important role in pain modulation and antinociception in the central nervous system. However, little is known about its peripheral effects. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of OT on the electrical properties of neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and the underlying mechanisms. DRG neurons from adult rats were acutely dissociated and cultured. Intracellular Ca2+ was determined by fluorescent microscopy using an indicator dye. The electrical properties of DRG neurons were tested by patch-clamp recording. The oxytocin receptor (OTR) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) on DRG neurons were assessed with immunofluorescence assays. OTR co-localized with nNOS in most of Isolectin B4 (IB4)-binding cultured DRG neurons in rats. OT decreased the excitability, increased the outward current, and evoked the membrane hyperpolarization in cultured DRG neurons. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), the donor of nitric oxide (NO), exerted similar effects as OT on the membrane potential of cultured DRG neurons. OT increased the production of NO in DRGs and cultured DRG neurons. Pre-treatment of the OTR antagonist atosiban or the selective nNOS inhibitor N-Propyl-l-arginine (NPLA) significantly attenuated the hyperpolarization effect evoked by OT. OT produced a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ in DRG neurons that responds to capsaicin, which can be attenuated by atosiban, but not by NPLA. OT-evoked membrane hyperpolarization and increase of outward current were distinctly attenuated by glibenclamide, a blocker of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channel. OT might be an endogenous antinociceptive agent and the peripheral antinociceptive effects of OT are mediated by activation of the Ca2+/nNOS/NO/KATP pathway in DRG neurons.

AB  - Abstract
Altered expression of neuronal cytoskeletal proteins are known to play an important role in hyper-excitability of neurons in patients and animal models of epilepsy. Our previous work showed that cell division cycle 42 GTP-binding protein (Cdc42), a small GTPase of the Rho-subfamily, is significantly increased in the brain tissue of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and in the brain tissues of the epileptic model of rats. However, whether inhibition of Cdc42 can modify epileptic seizures has not been investigated. In this study, using a pilocarpine-induced epileptic model, we found that pretreatment with ML141, a specific inhibitor of Cdc42, reduces seizure severity. Whole-cell patch-clamp recording on CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices from pilocarpine-induced epileptic model demonstrated that ML141 significantly inhibits the frequency of action potentials (APs), increases the amplitude and frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs), and increases the amplitude of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs). However, ML141 did not have an impact on the miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). Our results are the first to indicate that Cdc42 plays an important role in the onset and progression of epileptic-seizures by regulating synaptic inhibition.

AB  - Abstract
We have previously reported that presynaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline have been found in lipoprotein lipase (LPL) deficient mice, but the mechanism remains to be elucidated. Accumulating evidence supported that α-synuclein (α-syn) and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) are required for normal synaptic and cognitive function. In this study, we found that α-syn aggregated and the expression of UCHL1 decreased in the brain of LPL deficient mice. Reduction of UCHL1 was resulted from nuclear retention of DNA cytosine-5-methyltransferase 1 in LPL knockout mice. Reverse changes were found in cultured cells overexpressing LPL. Furthermore, deficiency of LPL increased ubiquitination of α-syn. These results indicated that aggregation of α-syn and reduction of UCHL1 expression in LPL-deficient mice may affect synaptic function.

Previous studies have established the importance of the fronto-parietal brain network in the information processing of reasoning. At the level of cortical source analysis, this eletroencepalogram (EEG) study investigates the functional reorganization of the theta-band (4–8 Hz) neurocognitive network of mathematically gifted adolescents during deductive reasoning. Depending on the dense increase of long-range phase synchronizations in the reasoning process, math-gifted adolescents show more significant adaptive reorganization and enhanced “workspace” configuration in the theta network as compared with average-ability control subjects. The salient areas are mainly located in the anterior cortical vertices of the fronto-parietal network. Further correlation analyses have shown that the enhanced workspace configuration with respect to the global topological metrics of the theta network in math-gifted subjects is correlated with the intensive frontal midline theta (fm theta) response that is related to strong neural effort for cognitive events. These results suggest that by investing more cognitive resources math-gifted adolescents temporally mobilize an enhanced task-related global neuronal workspace, which is manifested as a highly integrated fronto-parietal information processing network during the reasoning process.

AB  - Abstract
Cyclic AMP signaling is critical for activity-dependent refinement of neuronal circuits. Global disruption of adenylyl cyclase 1 (AC1), the major calcium/calmodulin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase in the brain, impairs formation of whisker-related discrete neural modules (the barrels) in cortical layer 4 in mice. Since AC1 is expressed both in the thalamus and the neocortex, the question of whether pre- or postsynaptic (or both) AC1 plays a role in barrel formation has emerged. Previously, we generated cortex-specific AC1 knockout (Cx-AC1KO) mice and found that these animals develop histologically normal barrels, suggesting a potentially more prominent role for thalamic AC1 in barrel formation. To determine this, we generated three new lines of mice: one in which AC1 is disrupted in nearly half of the thalamic ventrobasal nucleus cells in addition to the cortical excitatory neurons (Cx/pTh-AC1KO mouse), and another in which AC1 is disrupted in the thalamus but not in the cortex or brainstem nuclei of the somatosensory system (Th-AC1KO mouse). Cx/pTh-AC1KO mice show severe deficits in barrel formation. Th-AC1KO mice show even more severe disruption in barrel patterning. In these two lines, single thalamocortical (TC) axon labeling revealed a larger lateral extent of TC axons in layer 4 compared to controls. In the third line, all calcium-stimulated adenylyl cyclases (both AC1 and AC8) are deleted in cortical excitatory neurons. These mice have normal barrels. Taken together, these results indicate that thalamic AC1 plays a major role in patterning and refinement of the mouse TC circuitry.

AB  - Abstract
Astrocytes synthesize and release endozepines, a family of regulatory neuropeptides, including diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) and its processing fragments such as the octadecaneuropeptide (ODN). At the molecular level, ODN interacts with two types of receptors, i.e. it acts as an inverse agonist of the central-type benzodiazepine receptor (CBR), and as an agonist of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). ODN exerts a wide range of biological effects mediated through these two receptors and, in particular, it regulates astrocyte activity through an autocrine/paracrine mechanism involving the metabotropic receptor. More recently, it has been shown that Müller glial cells secrete phosphorylated DBI and that bisphosphorylated ODN ([bisphospho-Thr3,9]ODN, bpODN) has a stronger affinity for CBR than ODN. The aim of the present study was thus to investigate whether bpODN is released by mouse cortical astrocytes and to compare its potency to ODN. Using a radioimmunoassay and mass spectrometry analysis we have shown that bpODN as well as ODN were released in cultured astrocyte supernatants. Both bpODN and ODN increased astrocyte calcium event frequency but in a very different range of concentration. Indeed, ODN stimulatory effect decreased at concentrations over 10−10 M whereas bpODN increased the calcium event frequency at similar doses. In vivo effects of bpODN and ODN were analyzed in two behavioral paradigms involving either the metabotropic receptor (anorexia) or the CBR (anxiety). As previously described, ODN (100 ng, icv) induced a significant reduction of food intake. Similar effect was achieved with bpODN but at a 10 times higher dose (1000 ng, icv). Similarly, and contrasting with our hypothesis, bpODN was also 10 times less potent than ODN to induce anxiety-related behavior in the elevated zero maze test. Thus, the present data do not support that phosphorylation of ODN is involved in receptor selectivity but indicate that it rather weakens ODN activity.

AB  - Abstract
The modulation of the neural output to forelimb and hindlimb muscles when the left and right sides step at different speeds from one another in quadrupeds was assessed by obtaining electromyography (EMG) in seven intact adult cats during split-belt locomotion. To determine if changes in EMG during split-belt locomotion were modulated according to the speed of the belt the limb was stepping on, values were compared to those obtained during tied-belt locomotion (equal left–right speeds) at matched speeds. Cats were chronically implanted for EMG, which was obtained from six muscles: biceps brachii, triceps brachii, flexor carpi ulnaris, sartorius, vastus lateralis and medial gastrocnemius. During tied-belt locomotion, cats stepped from 0.4 to 1.0 m/s in 0.1 m/s increments whereas during split-belt locomotion, cats stepped with left–right speed differences of 0.1 to 0.4 m/s in 0.1 m/s increments. During tied-belt locomotion, EMG burst durations and mean EMG amplitudes of all muscles respectively decreased and increased with increasing speed. During split-belt locomotion, there was a clear differential modulation of the EMG patterns between flexors and extensors and between the slow and fast sides. Changes in the EMG pattern of some muscles could be explained by the speed of the belt the limb was stepping on, while in other muscles there were clear dissociations from tied-belt values at matched speeds. Therefore, results show that EMG patterns during split-belt locomotion are modulated to meet task requirements partly via signals related to the stepping speed of the homonymous limb and from the other limbs.

AB  - Abstract
Modulation of corticostriatal synaptic activity by dopamine is required for normal sensorimotor behaviors. After loss of nigrostriatal dopamine axons in Parkinson’s disease, l-3,4-dihydroxyphenlalanine (l-DOPA) and dopamine D2-like receptor agonists are used as replacement therapy, although these drugs also trigger sensitized sensorimotor responses including dyskinesias and impulse control disorders. In mice, we lesioned dopamine projections to the left dorsal striatum and assayed unilateral sensorimotor deficits with the corridor test as well as presynaptic corticostriatal activity with the synaptic vesicle probe, FM1–43. Sham-lesioned mice acquired food equivalently on both sides, while D2 receptor activation filtered the less active corticostriatal terminals, a response that required coincident co-activation of mGlu-R5 metabotropic glutamate and CB1 endocannabinoid receptors. Lesioned mice did not acquire food from their right, but overused that side following treatment with l-DOPA. Synaptic filtering on the lesioned side was abolished by either l-DOPA or a D2 receptor agonist, but when combined with a CB1 receptor antagonist, l-DOPA or D2 agonists normalized both synaptic filtering and behavior. Thus, high-pass filtering of corticostriatal synapses by the coordinated activation of D2, mGlu-R5, and CB1 receptors is required for normal sensorimotor response to environmental cues.

AB  - Abstract
Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have suggested that different cerebral regions preferentially process human voice and music. Yet, little is known on the temporal course of the brain processes that decode the category of sounds and how the expertise in one sound category can impact these processes. To address this question, we recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) of 15 musicians and 18 non-musicians while they were listening to short musical excerpts (piano and violin) and vocal stimuli (speech and non-linguistic vocalizations). The task of the participants was to detect noise targets embedded within the stream of sounds. Event-related potentials revealed an early differentiation of sound category, within the first 100 ms after the onset of the sound, with mostly increased responses to musical sounds. Importantly, this effect was modulated by the musical background of participants, as musicians were more responsive to music sounds than non-musicians, consistent with the notion that musical training increases sensitivity to music. In late temporal windows, brain responses were enhanced in response to vocal stimuli, but musicians were still more responsive to music. These results shed new light on the temporal course of neural dynamics of auditory processing and reveal how it is impacted by the stimulus category and the expertise of participants.

AB  - Abstract
Prenatal stress (PNS) is a significant risk factor for the development of psychopathology in adulthood such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia and addiction. Animal models of PNS resemble many of the effects of PNS on humans and provide a means to study the accumulated effects of PNS over several generations on brain function. Here, we examined how mild PNS delivered during the third week in utero over four consecutive generations affects behavioral flexibility and functional signaling among cortical and limbic structures. These multi-generational prenatally stressed (MGPNS) rats were not impaired on an odor-cued reversal learning task as compared to control animals. Unilateral field potential (FP) recordings from the medial prefrontal cortex, basolateral amygdala, ventral hippocampus, and striatal territories revealed widespread differences in brain signaling between these groups during the odor sampling phase of the task. The FP power was significantly lower in most structures across most frequency bands in MGPNS animals, and the relative increase in power from baseline during the task was lower for the beta band (12–30 Hz) in MGPNS animals as compared to controls. The coherence of FPs between brain regions, however, was much higher in MGPNS animals among all structures and for most frequency bands. We propose that this pattern of changes in brain signaling reflects a simplification of network processing, which is consistent with reports of reduced spine density and dendritic complexity in the brains of animals receiving PNS. Our data support the proposal that recurrent ancestral stress leads to adaptations in the brain, and that these may confer adaptive behavior in some circumstances as compared to single-generation PNS.

AB  - Abstract
Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is an incurable, dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disease of the cerebellum caused by a polyglutamine-repeat expansion in the protein ataxin-1 (ATXN1). While analysis of human autopsy material indicates significant glial pathology in SCA1, previous research has focused on characterizing neuronal dysfunction. In this study, we characterized astrocytic and microglial response in SCA1 using a comprehensive array of mouse models. We have discovered that astrocytes and microglia are activated very early in SCA1 pathogenesis even when mutant ATXN1 expression was limited to Purkinje neurons. Glial activation occurred in the absence of neuronal death, suggesting that glial activation results from signals emanating from dysfunctional neurons. Finally, in all different models examined glial activation closely correlated with disease progression, supporting the development of glial-based biomarkers to follow disease progression.

AB  - Abstract
Fetal striatal transplantation has emerged as a new therapeutic strategy in Huntington’s disease (HD). Hypoxia is one of the microenvironmental stress conditions to which fetal tissue is exposed as soon as it is isolated and transplanted into the diseased host brain. Mechanisms that support neuroblast survival and replenishment of damaged cells within the HD brain in the hypoxic condition have yet to be fully elucidated. This study is aimed at investigating the molecular pathways associated with the hypoxic condition in human fetal striatal neuroblasts (human striatal precursor (HSP) cells), using the hypoxia-mimetic agent cobalt chloride (CoCl2). We analyzed the effect of CoCl2 on HSP cell proliferation and on the expression of hypoxia-related proteins, such as hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Moreover, we evaluated fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2; 50 ng/ml) and endothelin-1 (ET-1; 100 nM) proliferative/survival effects in HSP cells in normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Dose–response experiments using increasing concentrations of CoCl2 (50–750 μM) showed that the HSP cell growth was unaffected after 24 h, while it increased at 48 h, with the maximal effect observed at 400 μM. In contrast, cell survival was impaired at 72 h. Hypoxic conditions determined HIF-1α protein accumulation and increased gene and protein expression of VEGF, while FGF2 and ET-1 significantly stimulated HSP cell proliferation both in normoxic and hypoxic conditions, thus counteracting the apoptotic CoCl2 effect at 72 h. The incubation with selective receptor (FGFR1, endothelin receptor A (ETA) and endothelin receptor B (ETB)) inhibitors abolished the FGF2 and ET-1 neuroprotective effect. In particular, ET-1 stimulated HSP cell survival through ETA in normoxic conditions and through ETB during hypoxia. Accordingly, ETA expression was down-regulated, while ETB expression was up-regulated by CoCl2 treatment. Overall, our results support the idea that HSP cells possess the machinery for their adaptation to hypoxic conditions and that neurotrophic factors, such as FGF2 and ET-1, may sustain neurogenesis and long-term survival through complex receptor-mediated mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract
Neonatal cerebral hypoxia–ischemia (HI) is a major cause of neurological disorders and the most common cause of death and permanent disability worldwide, affecting 1–2/1000 live term births and up to 60% of preterm births. The Levine–Rice is the main experimental HI model; however, critical variables such as the age of animals, sex and hemisphere damaged still receive little attention in experimental design. We here investigated the influence of sex and hemisphere injured on the functional outcomes and tissue damage following early (hypoxia–ischemia performed at postnatal day 3 (HIP3)) and late (hypoxia–ischemia performed at postnatalday 7 (HIP7)) HI injury in rats. Male and female 3- (P3) or 7-day-old (P7) Wistar rats had their right or left common carotid artery occluded and exposed to 8% O2 for 1.5 h. Sham animals had their carotids exposed but not occluded nor submitted to the hypoxic atmosphere. Behavioral impairments were assessed in the open field arena, in the Morris water maze and in the inhibitory avoidance task; volumetric extent of tissue damage was assessed using cresyl violet staining at adult age, after completing behavioral assessment. The overall results demonstrate that: (1) HI performed at the two distinct ages cause different behavioral impairments and histological damage in adult rats (2) behavioral deficits following neonatal HIP3 and HIP7 are task-specific and dependent on sex and hemisphere injured (3) HIP7 animals presented the expected motor and cognitive deficits (4) HIP3 animals displayed discrete but significant cognitive impairments in the left hemisphere-injured females (5) HI brain injury and its consequences are determined by animal’s sex and the damaged hemisphere, markedly in HIP3-injured animals.

AB  - Abstract
Understanding the molecular mechanisms that promote stress resilience might open up new therapeutic avenues to prevent stress-related disorders. We recently characterized a stress and glucocorticoid-regulated gene, down-regulated in renal cell carcinoma – DRR1 (Fam107A). DRR1 is expressed in the mouse brain; it is up-regulated by stress and glucocorticoids and modulates neuronal actin dynamics. In the adult mouse, DRR1 was shown to facilitate specific behaviors which might be protective against some of the deleterious consequences of stress exposure: in the hippocampal CA3 region, DRR1 improved cognitive performance whereas in the septum, it specifically increased social behavior. Therefore DRR1 was suggested as a candidate protein promoting stress-resilience.

Fam107B (family with sequence similarity 107, member B) is the unique paralog of DRR1, and both share high sequence similarities, predicted glucocorticoid response elements, heat-shock induction and tumor suppressor properties. So far, the role of Fam107B in the central nervous system was not studied. The aim of the present investigation, therefore, was to analyze whether Fam107B and DRR1 display comparable mRNA expression patterns in the brain and whether both are modulated by stress and glucocorticoids.

Spatio-temporal mapping of Fam107B mRNA expression in the embryonic and adult mouse brain, by means of in situ hybridization, showed that Fam107B was expressed during embryogenesis and in the adulthood, with particularly high and specific expression in the forming telencephalon suggestive of an involvement in corticogenesis. In the adult mouse, expression was restricted to neurogenic niches, like the dentate gyrus. In contrast to DRR1, Fam107B mRNA expression failed to be modulated by glucocorticoids and social stress in the adult mouse.

In summary, Fam107B and DRR1 show different spatio-temporal expression patterns in the central nervous system, suggesting at least partially different functional roles in the brain, and where the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-induced regulation appears to be a unique property of DRR1.

AB  - Abstract
Research on motor imagery and action observation has become increasingly important in recent years particularly because of its potential benefits for movement rehabilitation and the optimization of athletic performance (Munzert et al., 2009). Motor execution, motor imagery, and action observation have been shown to rely largely on a similar neural network in motor and motor-related cortical areas (Jeannerod, 2001). Given that motor imagery is a covert stage of an action and its characteristics, it has been assumed that modifying the motor task in terms of, for example, effort will impact neural activity. With this background, the present study examined how different force requirements influence corticospinal excitability (CSE) and intracortical facilitation during motor imagery and action observation of a repetitive movement (dynamic force production). Participants were instructed to kinesthetically imagine or observe an abduction/adduction movement of the right index finger that differed in terms of force requirements. Trials were carried out with single- or paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. Surface electromyography was recorded from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and the abductor digiti minimi (ADM). As expected, results showed a significant main effect on mean peak-to-peak motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes in FDI but no differences in MEP amplitudes in ADM muscle. Participants’ mean peak-to-peak MEPs increased when the force requirements (movement effort) of the imagined or observed action were increased. This reveals an impact of the imagined and observed force requirements of repetitive movements on CSE. It is concluded that this effect might be due to stronger motor neuron recruitment for motor imagery and action observation with an additional load. That would imply that the modification of motor parameters in movements such as force requirements modulates CSE.

AB  - Abstract
Neurons and astrocytes, the two major cell populations in the adult brain, are characterized by their own mode of intercellular communication – the synapses and the gap junctions (GJ), respectively. In addition, there is increasing evidence for dynamic and metabolic neuroglial interactions resulting in the modulation of synaptic transmission at the so-called “tripartite synapse”. Based on this, we have investigated at the ultrastructural level how excitatory synapses (ES) and astroglial GJ are spatially distributed in layer IV of the barrel cortex of the adult mouse. We used specific antibodies for connexin (Cx) 30 and 43 to identify astroglial GJ, these two proteins are known to be present in the majority of astroglial GJ in the cerebral cortex. In electron-microscopic images, we measured the distance between two ES, between two GJ and between a GJ and its nearest ES. We found a ratio of two GJ per three ES in the hollow and septal areas. Taking into account the size of an astrocyte domain, the high density of GJ suggests the occurrence of reflexive type, i.e. GJ between processes of the same astrocyte. Interestingly, the distance between an ES and an astroglial GJ was found to be significantly lower than that between either two synapses or between two GJ. These observations indicate that the two modes of cell-to-cell communication are not randomly distributed in layer IV of the barrel cortex. Consequently, this feature may provide the morphological support for the recently reported functional interactions between neuronal circuits and astroglial networks.

AB  - Abstract
Ontogenetic life and stress can have different effects on the nerve growth factor (NGF) and its tyrosine kinase receptor A (TrkA) in the structures of the limbic system. This study aimed to explore the influence of two different stressors, acute and chronic exposure to forced swim (FS) stress or high-light open-field (HL-OF) stress, on cells containing NGF and TrkA. Immunofluorescence staining was used to reveal the density of NGF and TrkA immunoreactive (ir) cells in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus or hippocampal subfields CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) in adult (postnatal day 90; P90) and aged (P720) rats. Data revealed that neither acute nor chronic FS caused any alteration in NGF-ir and TrkA-ir cells in any of the structures investigated in P90 and P720 rats. However, a significant increase in NGF-ir was detected in the CA1 and CA3 after acute but not after chronic HL-OF in both age groups. The TrkA-ir remained unchanged after exposure to HL-OF in the PVN and hippocampus. Despite lack of change in the density of NGF-ir and TrkA-ir cells between P90 and P720 non-stressed rats, a significant age-related decrease in NGF-ir and TrkA-ir cells in the PVN of FS- and HL-OF-stressed rats was noted. However, in the hippocampus, an age-related decrease in NGF-ir or TrkA-ir cells was observed in all rats except acute FS-stressed rats. The changes are possibly associated with involutional aging processes caused by insufficient control of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis functioning in P720 rats and may contribute to disturbances in NGF signaling.

AB  - Abstract
To improve the assessment of awareness in patients with disorders of consciousness, recent protocols using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) have been developed, and led some specialized coma centers to use this method on a routine basis. Recently, promising results have also been observed with electroencephalography (EEG), a less expensive and widely available technique. However, since the spatiotemporal nature of the recorded signal differs between both EEG and fMRI, the question of whether one method could substitute or should complement the other method is a matter of debate. In this study, we compared the neural processes of two well-known EEG and fMRI mental imagery protocols to define the relative place of each method in the assessment of awareness. A group of 20 healthy volunteers performed both EEG and fMRI command-following and communication tasks. Distinct command following was found with both EEG and fMRI for five subjects, only with fMRI for 12 subjects, and only with EEG for one subject. In the communication task, neither EEG nor fMRI alone gave satisfactory results and no reliable communication could be established in approximately 1/3rd of the participants. If fMRI showed the best performance to detect volitional reactions in mental imagery tasks, our results provide evidence that the use of EEG must not be underestimated since a better detection was found with this method for at least one subject. More than being used as a substitute, EEG should complement fMRI to improve the detection of sign of awareness, and to reduce the risks of misjudgments.

AB  - Abstract
Recent studies indicate that over-activation of Cdk5 is a crucial pro-death signal and Cdk5 activity inhibition provides neuroprotection in animal stroke models. However, Cdk5 inhibitors are reported to affect physiological functions of Cdk5 and lead to serious side effects. Therefore, targeting Cdk5 or its activators without affecting physiological functions of Cdk5 is a therapeutic strategy for ischemic brain injury. In this study, we examined Cdk5 activity in a rat hypoxia/ischemia (HI) injury model. Cdk5 expression was not changed after HI injury, but Cdk5 activity significantly increased, which was demonstrated by the increased phorsphorylation—phosphorylation of Tau and glucocorticoid receptor (GR), two downstream signals of Cdk5. We further showed that the levels of Cdk5 activators p35 and p39 decreased after HI injury, while p25, which is converted from p35 and has a higher activator activity on Cdk5, increased markedly after HI injury. P5, a 24-residue mimetic peptide of p35, was reported to specifically inhibit the p25/Cdk5 signal pathway in an Alzheimer’s disease model. P5-TAT, which can cross the blood–brain barrier and cell membrane facilitated by TAT protein, was used in our study. We found that p5-TAT treatment did not change the levels of p35, p39, and p25, but reduced the phorsphorylation of Tau and GR, suggesting the inhibition of the p25/Cdk5 by the peptide p5-TAT. This was supported by the fact that p5 interacted with Cdk5, but not with Cdk5 activators. In addition, p5-TAT reduced cleaved caspase-3 level, a marker of neuronal apoptosis. We further demonstrated that p5-TAT pre-treatment reduced cerebral infarct volume; even when p5-TAT was delayed to be administered at 24 h after HI injury, p5-TAT still promoted long-term functional recovery. Therefore, Cdk5 inhibition by the small peptide p5-TAT or its derivatives is a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ischemic brain injury including hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and stroke.

AB  - Abstract
PTEN serves as an intrinsic brake on neurite outgrowth, but the regulatory mechanism that governs its action is not clear. In the present study, miR-29a was found to increase neurite outgrowth by decreasing PTEN expression. Results showed that miR-92a-1, miR-29a, miR-92b, and miR-29c expression levels increased during nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced differentiation of PC12 cells. Based on in silico analysis of possible miR-29a targets, PTEN mRNA may be a binding site for miR-29a. A protein expression assay and luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-29a could directly target the 3′-UTRs (untranslated regions) of PTEN mRNA and down-regulate the expression of PTEN. PC12 cells infected with lentiviral pLKO-miR-29a showed far higher levels of miR-29a and Akt phosphorylation level than those infected with control. This promoted neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. Collectively, these results indicate that miR-29a is an important regulator of neurite outgrowth via targeting PTEN and that it may be a promising therapeutic target for neural disease.

AB  - Abstract
Intestinal inflammation causes initial axonal degeneration and neuronal death, as well as the proliferation of intestinal smooth muscle cells (ISMC), but subsequent axonal outgrowth leads to re-innervation. We recently showed that expression of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), the critical neurotrophin for the post-natal enteric nervous system (ENS) is upregulated in ISMC by inflammatory cytokines, leading us to explore the relationship between ISMC growth and GDNF expression. In co-cultures of myenteric neurons and ISMC, GDNF or fetal calf serum (FCS) was equally effective in supporting neuronal survival, with neurons forming extensive axonal networks among the ISMC. However, only GDNF was effective in low-density cultures where neurons lacked contact with ISMC. In early-passage cultures of colonic circular smooth muscle cells (CSMC), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blotting showed that proliferation was associated with expression of GDNF, and the successful survival of neonatal neurons co-cultured on CSMC was blocked by vandetanib or siGDNF. In tri-nitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis, immunocytochemistry showed the selective expression of GDNF in proliferating CSMC, suggesting that smooth muscle proliferation supports the ENS in vivo as well as in vitro. However, high-passage CSMC expressed significantly less GDNF and failed to support neuronal survival, while expressing reduced amounts of smooth muscle marker proteins. We conclude that in the inflamed intestine, smooth muscle proliferation supports the ENS, and thus its own re-innervation, by expression of GDNF. In chronic inflammation, a compromised smooth muscle phenotype may lead to progressive neural damage. Intestinal stricture formation in human disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), may be an endpoint of failure of this homeostatic mechanism.

AB  - Abstract
To probe the mechanism underlying the auditory behavior-related response patterns of inferior collicular neurons to constant frequency–frequency modulation (CF–FM) stimulus in Hipposideros pratti, we studied the role of post-spike hyperpolarization (PSH) in the formation of response patterns. Neurons obtained by in vivo extracellular (N = 145) and intracellular (N = 171) recordings could be consistently classified into single-on (SO) and double-on (DO) neurons. Using intracellular recording, we found that both SO and DO neurons have a PSH with different durations. Statistical analysis showed that most SO neurons had a longer PSH duration than DO neurons (p &lt; 0.01). These data suggested that the PSH directly participated in the formation of SO and DO neurons, and the PSH elicited by the CF component was the main synaptic mechanism underlying the SO and DO response patterns. The possible biological significance of these findings relevant to bat echolocation is discussed.

AB  - Abstract
In animal models, environmental enrichment (EE) has been found to be an efficient treatment for alleviating the consequences of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI). However the potential for this therapeutic strategy and the mechanisms involved are not yet clear. The aim of present study is to investigate behavioral performance in the ox-maze test and Na+,K+-ATPase, catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities in the hippocampus of rats that suffered neonatal HI and were stimulated in an enriched environment. Seven-day-old rats were submitted to the HI procedure and divided into four groups: control maintained in standard environment (CTSE), control submitted to EE (CTEE), HI in standard environment (HISE) and HI in EE (HIEE). Animals were stimulated with EE for 9 weeks (1 h/day for 6 days/week) and then behavioral and biochemical parameters were evaluated. Present results indicate learning and memory in the ox-maze task were impaired in HI rats and this effect was recovered after EE. Hypoxic–ischemic event did not alter the Na+,K+-ATPase activity in the right hippocampus (ipsilateral to arterial occlusion). However, on the contralateral hemisphere, HI caused a decrease in this enzyme activity that was recovered by EE. The activities of GPx and CAT were not changed by HI in any group evaluated. In conclusion, EE was effective in recovering learning and memory impairment in the ox-maze task and Na+,K+-ATPase activity in the hippocampus caused by HI. The present data provide further support for the therapeutic potential of environmental stimulation after neonatal HI in rats.

Pain patients who are nicotine dependent report a significantly increased incidence and severity of pain intensity. The goal of this study was to determine the effects of prolonged nicotine administration on inflammatory proteins implicated in the development of peripheral and central sensitization of the trigeminal system. Behavioral, immunohistochemical, and microarray studies were utilized to investigate the effects of nicotine administered daily for 14 days via an Alzet® osmotic pump in Sprague Dawley rats. Systemic nicotine administration caused a significant increase in nocifensive withdrawals to mechanical stimulation of trigeminal neurons. Nicotine stimulated expression of the pro-inflammatory signal transduction proteins phosphorylated-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), phosphorylated-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK), and protein kinase A (PKA) in the spinal trigeminal nucleus. Nicotine also promoted elevations in the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a biomarker of activated astrocytes, and the microglia biomarker ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1). Similarly, levels of eleven cytokines were significantly elevated with the largest increase in expression of TNF-α. Levels of PKA, p-ERK, and p-JNK in trigeminal ganglion neurons were increased by nicotine. Our findings demonstrate that prolonged systemic administration of nicotine promotes sustained behavioral and cellular changes in the expression of key proteins in the spinal trigeminal nucleus and trigeminal ganglion implicated in the development and maintenance of peripheral and central sensitization.

Sleep perturbations including fragmented sleep with frequent night-time awakenings and daytime naps are common in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and these daily disruptions are a major factor for institutionalization. The objective of this study was to investigate if sleep–wake patterns are altered in 5XFAD mice, a well-characterized double transgenic mouse model of AD which exhibits an early onset of robust AD pathology and memory deficits. These mice have five distinct human mutations in two genes, the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Presenilin1 (PS1) engineered into two transgenes driven by a neuron-specific promoter (Thy1), and thus develop severe amyloid deposition by 4 months of age. Age-matched (4–6.5 months old) male and female 5XFAD mice were monitored and compared to wild-type littermate controls for multiple sleep traits using a non-invasive, high throughput, automated piezoelectric system which detects breathing and gross body movements to characterize sleep and wake. Sleep–wake patterns were recorded continuously under baseline conditions (undisturbed) for 3 days and after sleep deprivation of 4 h, which in mice produces a significant sleep debt and challenge to sleep homeostasis. Under baseline conditions, 5XFAD mice exhibited shorter bout lengths (14% lower values for males and 26% for females) as compared to controls (p &lt; 0.001). In females, the 5XFAD mice also showed 12% less total sleep than WT (p &lt; 0.01). Bout length reductions were greater during the night (the active phase for mice) than during the day, which does not model the human condition of disrupted sleep at night (the inactive period). However, the overall decrease in bout length suggests increased fragmentation and disruption in sleep consolidation that may be relevant to human sleep. The 5XFAD mice may serve as a useful model for testing therapeutic strategies to improve sleep consolidation in AD patients.

Working memory (WM) is a core element of temporal information processing, but little is known about the internal representation and neuronal underpinnings of the duration maintenance in WM. The neural oscillations during maintenance of duration in WM were examined using electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. The EEG results showed that theta amplitude was not modulated by the length of duration retained in WM, while alpha amplitude decreased in a 4-s duration condition compared with 1-s, 2-s, and 3-s duration conditions. The amplitude of alpha power positively correlated with accuracy for the 3-s duration condition. The results suggest that alpha activity is involved in duration maintenance in WM. Our study provides electrophysiological evidence that different internal representations are retained in WM for durations below and above about 3 s.

AB  - Abstract
Iron homeostasis is essential for the integrity of brain monoaminergic functions and its deregulation might be involved in neurological movement disorders such as the restless legs syndrome (RLS). Although iron metabolism breakdown concomitantly appears with monoaminergic system dysfunction in iron-deficient rodents and in RLS patients, the direct consequences of peripheral iron deficiency in the central nervous system (CNS) of non-human primates have received little attention. Here, we evaluated the peripheral iron-depletion impact on brain monoamine levels in macaque monkeys. After documenting circadian variations of iron and iron-related proteins (hemoglobin, ferritin and transferrin) in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of normal macaques, repeated blood withdrawals (RBW) were used to reduce peripheral iron-related parameter levels. Decreased serum iron levels were paradoxically associated with increased CSF iron concentrations. Despite limited consequences on tissue monoamine contents (dopamine – DA, 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid – DOPAC, homovanillic acid, L-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine – L-DOPA, 5–8 hydroxytryptamine – 5-HT, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid – 5-HIAA and noradrenaline) measured with post-mortem chromatography, we found distinct and region-dependent relationships of these tissue concentrations with CSF iron and/or serum iron and/or blood hemoglobin. Additionally, striatal extracellular DA, DOPAC and 5-HIAA levels evaluated by in vivo microdialysis showed a substantial increase, suggesting an overall increase in both DA and 5-HT tones. Finally, a trending increase in general locomotor activity, measured by actimetry, was observed in the most serum iron-depleted macaques. Taken together, our data are compatible with an increase in nigrostriatal DAergic function in the event of iron deficiency and point to a specific alteration of the 5-HT/DA interaction in the CNS that is possibly involved in the etiology of RLS.

AB  - Abstract
Donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor, is a representative symptomatic therapy for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent studies have reported the anti-inflammatory effects of donepezil. However, limited studies that investigate its anti-inflammatory effect in AD have been reported. Considering the role of proinflammatory molecules and microglial activation in the pathogenesis of AD, the current study aimed to elucidate the effects of donepezil on microglial activation induced by amyloid deposition in transgenic mice. Our results showed that chronic treatment with donepezil significantly improved the cognitive function in the novel object recognition test and Morris water maze test in amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin-1 (PS1) transgenic mice. We further demonstrated that these cognitive enhancements were related to the anti-inflammatory effect of donepezil. We found that donepezil could inhibit the expression of CD68, a specific marker of microglial activation, and reduce the release of proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β. Immunohistochemistry and Congo red co-staining revealed that congophilic amyloid and activated microglia around plaques were also reduced by donepezil treatment. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis showed that donepezil decreased insoluble Aβ40/Aβ42 and soluble Aβ40 levels. Moreover, donepezil reversed the impaired expression of insulin-degrading enzyme in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Our findings indicated that donepezil improves cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice by a mechanism that may be associated with its inhibition of microglial activation and release of proinflammatory cytokines.

AB  - Abstract
Recent research suggests an involvement of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene products (e.g., beta-endorphin) in modulating cocaine-induced reward and addiction-like behaviors in rodents. In this study, we investigated whether chronic “binge” cocaine and its withdrawal altered POMC gene expression in the brain of rats. Male Fischer rats were treated with two different chronic (14-day) “binge” pattern cocaine administration regimens (three injections at 1-h intervals, i.p.): steady-dose (45 mg/kg/day) and escalating-dose (90 mg/kg on the last day). Although there was no POMC mRNA alteration after chronic steady-dose cocaine, a significant decrease in POMC mRNA levels in the hypothalamus was found after chronic escalating-dose cocaine. In contrast, after acute (1-day) withdrawal from chronic “binge” escalating-dose regimen, but not steady-dose regimen, there were increased hypothalamic POMC mRNA levels that persisted into 14 days of protracted withdrawal. To study the role of the endogenous opioid systems in the cocaine withdrawal effects, we administered a single naloxone injection (1 mg/kg) that caused elevated POMC mRNA levels observed 24 h later in cocaine naïve rats, but it did not lead to further increases in cocaine-withdrawn rats. Our results suggest that during withdrawal from chronic “binge” escalating-dose cocaine: (1) there was a persistent increase in hypothalamic POMC gene expression; and (2) hyposensitivity of the POMC gene expression to naloxone indicates altered opioidergic tone at or above the hypothalamic level.

AB  - Abstract
We tested predictions of a hierarchical scheme on the control of natural movements with referent body configurations. Subjects occupied an initial hand position against a bias force generated by a HapticMaster robot. A smooth force perturbation was applied to the hand consisting of an increase in the bias force, keeping it at a new level for 5 s, and decreasing it back to the bias value. When the force returned to the bias value, the arm stopped at a position different from the initial one interpreted as an involuntary movement. We then asked subjects to make voluntary movements to targets corresponding to the measured end-position of the unintentional movements. No target for hand orientation was used. The joint configuration variance was compared between intentional and unintentional movements within the framework of the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis. Our central hypothesis was that both unintentional and intentional movements would be characterized by structure of joint configuration variance reflecting task-specific stability of salient performance variables, such as hand position and orientation. The analysis confirmed that most variance at the final steady states was compatible with unchanged values of both hand position and orientation following both intentional and unintentional movements. We interpret unintentional movements as consequences of back-coupling between the actual and referent configurations at the task level. The results suggested that both intentional and unintentional movements resulted from shifts of the body referent configuration produced intentionally or as a result of the hypothesized back-coupling. Inter-trial variance signature reflects similar task-specific stability properties of the system following both types of movements, intentional and unintentional.

AB  - Abstract
Inhibitory interneurons with somata in strata radiatum and lacunosum-moleculare (SR/L-M) of hippocampal area CA3 receive excitatory input from pyramidal cells via the recurrent collaterals (RCs), and the dentate gyrus granule cells via the mossy fibers (MFs). Here we demonstrate that Hebbian long-term potentiation (LTP) at RC synapses on SR/L-M interneurons requires the concomitant activation of calcium-impermeable AMPARs (CI-AMPARs) and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). RC LTP was prevented by voltage clamping the postsynaptic cell during high-frequency stimulation (HFS; 3 trains of 100 pulses delivered at 100 Hz every 10 s), with intracellular injections of the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA (20 mM), and with the NMDAR antagonist D-AP5. In separate experiments, RC and MF inputs converging onto the same interneuron were sequentially activated. We found that RC LTP induction was blocked by inhibitors of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII; KN-62, 10 μM or KN-93, 10 μM) but MF LTP was CaMKII independent. Conversely, the application of the protein kinase A (PKA) activators forskolin/IBMX (50 μM/25 μM) potentiated MF EPSPs but not RC EPSPs. Together these data indicate that the aspiny dendrites of SR/L-M interneurons compartmentalize synapse-specific Ca2+ signaling required for LTP induction at RC and MF synapses. We also show that the two signal transduction cascades converge to activate a common effector, protein kinase C (PKC). Specifically, LTP at RC and MF synapses on the same SR/LM interneuron was blocked by postsynaptic injections of chelerythrine (10 μM). These data indicate that both forms of LTP share a common mechanism involving PKC-dependent signaling modulation.

AB  - Abstract
The functions of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) and the VEGF receptor 3 (VEGFR-3) in the nervous system are not well known. In this study, we examined the role of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 in ischemic preconditioning (IPC)-induced tolerance in the mouse hippocampus. Adult male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to either severe ischemia (SI) induced by 40 min of bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) with or without IPC (5-min BCCAO) or IPC only. Cerebral blood flow was measured during ischemic periods using laser Doppler flowmetry. Neuronal damage was assessed histologically, and VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 expression levels were assessed through immunostaining. Fluoro-Jade B-labeled cells were abundant in the CA1 area 7 days after SI without IPC (sham + SI group), whereas cells were rarely labeled in mice subjected to IPC followed by SI (IPC + SI group). Similarly, the number of neuronal nuclei (NeuN)-positive cells in the CA1 area was significantly lower in the sham + SI group than in the IPC + SI group. Interestingly, we found that sublethal IPC treatment induced prominent VEGF-C expression in the CA1 pyramidal neurons and VEGFR-3 expression in the stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosum moleculare after 3 days of reperfusion that were sustained for 7 days. Moreover, VEGF-C immunoreactivity was also markedly increased, whereas VEGFR-3 expression was sustained in tolerance-acquired CA1 neurons after SI. Application of a VEGFR-3 inhibitor, SAR131675, abolished the IPC-induced neuroprotection in a dose-dependent manner in the mouse hippocampus. These results suggest that VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 signaling is associated with IPC-induced hippocampal tolerance to lethal ischemia.

AB  - Abstract
Previous studies have demonstrated that the red nucleus (RN) participates in the modulation of neuropathic pain and plays both a facilitated role by pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and an inhibitory role through the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. In this study, we sought to investigate the expressions and roles of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, as well as its type 1 receptor (TGF-β-R1) in the RN in normal and neuropathic pain rats. Immunohistochemistry showed that TGF-β and TGF-β-R1 were constitutively expressed in the RN of normal rats, and co-localized with neurons and all three glial cell types, astrocytes, microglia and oligodendrocytes. Following spared nerve injury (SNI), the expression levels of TGF-β and TGF-β-R1 were significantly down-regulated in the RN contralateral (but not ipsilateral) to the nerve injury side of rats at one week and reached the lowest level at two weeks after SNI, and both of them were co-localized with neurons and oligodendrocytes but not with astrocytes and microglia. Microinjection of different doses of anti-TGF-β antibody (250, 125, 50 ng) into the unilateral RN of normal rats dose-dependently decreased the mechanical withdrawal threshold of contralateral (but not ipsilateral) hind paw and induced significant mechanical hypersensitivity, which was similar to mechanical allodynia induced by peripheral nerve injury. In contrast, microinjection of different doses of recombinant rat TGF-β1 (500, 250, 100 ng) into the RN contralateral to the nerve injury side of SNI rats dose-dependently increased the paw withdrawal threshold and significantly alleviated mechanical allodynia induced by SNI. These results suggest that TGF-β in the RN participates in nociceptive processing and plays antinociceptive effects under normal physiological condition and in the development of neuropathic pain induced by SNI.

Studies demonstrated that chronic high-dose homocysteine administration induced learning and memory impairment in animals. Atractylenolide III (Aen-III), a neuroprotective constituent of Atractylodis macrocephalae Koidz, was isolated in our previous study. In this study, we investigated potential benefits of Aen-III in preventing learning and memory impairment following chronic high-dose homocysteine administration in rats. Results showed that administration of Aen-III significantly ameliorated learning and memory impairment induced by chronic high-dose homocysteine administration in rats, decreased homocysteine-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and restored homocysteine-induced decrease of phosphorylated protein kinase C expression level. Moreover, Aen-III protected primary cultured neurons from apoptotic death induced by homocysteine treatment. This study provides the first evidence for the neuroprotective effect of Aen-III in preventing learning and impairment induced by chronic administration of homocysteine. Aen-III may have therapeutic potential in treating homocysteine-mediated cognitive impairment and neuronal injury.

AB  - Abstract
Melanin-concentrating hormone [MCH] is a neuropeptide that modulates several behaviors, such as feeding and reward. Because the hedonic and rewarding features of a food also influence feeding behavior, the nucleus accumbens [Acb] has been highlighted as a key area integrating these roles. Functional data confirm that MCH acts on a subdivision of the Acb; however, considering the importance of finding anatomical and neurochemical data that correlate the previously demonstrated function of MCH, we delineated this investigation based on the following points: (1) Is there a pattern of innervation by MCH fibers regarding the subregions within the Acb? (2) Specifically, which hypothalamic nuclei synthesize MCH and innervate the Acb? (3) Finally, what are the neurochemical identities of the accumbal neurons innervated by MCH inputs? We examined the MCH immunoreactivity [MCH-ir] in the Acb in rat brains using the peroxidase technique. Additionally, after injecting retrograde neuronal tracer [Fluoro-Gold® – FG®] into subdivisions of the Acb [shell or core], we mapped single- or double-labeled cells. Moreover, using a double immunoperoxidase protocol, we investigated the MCH-ir fibers for gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA]-ir and choline acetyltransferase [ChAT]-ir cells in the shell subdivision of the Acb [AcbSh]. We found that the MCH-ir fibers preferentially innervate the medial AcbSh, particularly the septal pole. This innervation originated from the incerto-hypothalamic area [IHy], internuclear area, lateral hypothalamic area, perifornical area, periventricular nucleus and posterior hypothalamus. Moreover, the IHy has the highest relationship between double/single retrogradely labeled cells [n = 5.33 ± 0.66/16 ± 0.93, i.e. 33.33%] in the whole hypothalamus. Furthermore, our data suggest that MCH-ir fibers are in apposition to GABAergic and cholinergic cells in the AcbSh. Therefore, we provide anatomical support to the ongoing functional studies investigating the relation among the hypothalamus, MCH transmission into the Acb and the involvement of known neuronal phenotypes within the AcbSh.

AB  - Abstract
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are distributed widely in the central nervous system and play important roles in higher brain functions, including learning, memory, and recognition. However, functions of the cholinergic system in spinal motoneurons remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the actions of presynaptic and postsynaptic nAChRs in spinal ventral horn neurons by performing whole-cell patch-clamp recordings on lumbar slices from male rats. The application of nicotine or acetylcholine generated slow inward currents and increased the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs). Slow inward currents by acetylcholine or nicotine were not inhibited by tetrodotoxin (TTX) or glutamate receptor antagonists. In the presence of TTX, the frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were also increased by acetylcholine or nicotine. A selective α4β2 nicotinic receptor antagonist, dihydro-β-erythroidine hydrobromide (DhβE), significantly decreased nicotine-induced inward currents without affecting the enhancement of sEPSCs and mEPSCs. In addition, a selective α7 nicotinic receptor antagonist, methyllycaconitine, did not affect either nicotine-induced inward currents or the enhancement of sEPSCs and mEPSCs. These results suggest that α4β2 AChRs are localized at postsynaptic sites in the spinal ventral horn, non-α4β2 and non-α7 nAChRs are located presynaptically, and nAChRs enhance excitatory synaptic transmission in the spinal ventral horn.

AB  - Abstract
Ocular dominance plasticity is activity dependent, changes in response to eye competition, and is transitory during developmental stages. Lipid rafts have modulatory functions in cellular, physiological, and behavioral processes. Although many of these modulatory roles are mediated by flotillin-1, a lipid raft-associated protein, the ontogenetic changes in the cellular and subcellular distribution patterns of flotillin-1 are unclear. I investigated the developmental pattern of the distribution of flotillin-1 in the rat visual cortex with immunohistochemistry at both light and electron microscopic levels. An affinity-purified anti-flotillin-1 antibody reacted with a single band of about 40–50 kDa in total proteins prepared from the rat visual cortex. Flotillin-1 levels transiently increased on postnatal days 21–35. Flotillin-1 immunoreactivity at 3 weeks of age was broadly distributed though all visual cortical layers, but it exhibited a relatively higher density in layers II/III and V/VI. Flotillin-1 immunoreactivity at 3 months of age was significantly decreased compared with that at 3 weeks of age. Strong flotillin-1 immunoreactivity was observed in both neuronal perikarya and processes at 3 weeks of age. Double-labeling experiments with anti-microtubule-associated protein 2, anti-neurofilament, anti-synaptophysin, anti-vesicular glutamate transporter 1, anti-vesicular glutamate transporter 2, anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein, and flotillin-1 mainly labeled the somata of excitatory neurons and corticocortical synapses. Some flotillin-1 was distributed in excitatory neuron axons, thalamocortical synapses, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglial cells. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed numerous regions of flotillin-1 immunoreactivity near the rough endoplasmic reticulum in neurons and presynaptic regions at 3 weeks of age.

These findings illustrate early developmental changes in the cellular and subcellular localization of flotillin-1 protein in the rat visual cortex. Moreover, the ultrastructural distribution of flotillin-1 immunoreactivity suggested that flotillin-1 was transported mainly into presynaptic terminals where it exerts effects at the presynaptic sites of excitatory and inhibitory neurons.

AB  - Abstract
Mood disorders are a severe health burden but molecular mechanisms underlying mood dysfunction remain poorly understood. Here, we show that wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (Wip1) negatively responds to the stress-induced negative mood-related behaviors. Specifically, we show that Wip1 protein but not its mRNA level was downregulated in the hippocampus but not in the neocortex after 4 weeks of chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) in mice. Moreover, the CUMS-responsive WIP1 downregulation in the hippocampus was restored by chronic treatment of fluoxetine (i.p. 20 mg/kg) along with the CUMS procedure. In addition, Wip1 knockout mice displayed decreased exploratory behaviors as well as increased anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors in mice without impaired motor activities under the non-CUMS condition. Furthermore, the Wip1 deficiency-responsive anxiety-like but not depression-like behaviors were further elevated in mice under CUMS. Although limitations like male-alone sampling and multiply behavioral testing exist, the present study suggests a potential protective function of Wip1 in mood stabilization.

AB  - Abstract
Mice develop weight-bearing locomotion within the first 2–3 weeks of birth, a period during which motoneurons (MNs) and interneurons (INs) that control locomotor activities undergo rapid maturation. In this study, we investigate the maturation of two subpopulations of V3 INs in the mouse spinal cord during this period. To do this, we conducted whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of tdTomato fluorescent protein-expressing spinal V3 INs from Sim1Cre/+;tdTom mice at post-natal day (P) 0, P4, P9 and P14 and compared their properties to those at P21. Combining electrophysiology with computational analyses, we show that dorsal and ventral V3 subpopulations are physiologically distinct at birth, but the electrophysiological properties of V3 INs change significantly during the first three post-natal weeks. We further reveal that there are multiple developmental phases of both V3 subpopulations during the maturation process. The different developmental trajectories of physiological properties also coincide with changes in an animal’s locomotor behavior. These properties likely reflect the differential functions of V3 subpopulations in maturing spinal locomotor circuits.

AB  - Abstract
Serotonin (5-HT) is a key regulator of mood and sexual behaviors. 5-HT reuptake inhibitors have been used as antidepressants. Really interesting new gene (RING) finger proteins have been associated with 5-HT regulation but their role remains largely unknown. Some RING finger proteins are involved in the serotonergic system, therefore, we speculate that the gene expression of RING finger protein38 (rnf38) is regulated by the serotonergic system. In the present study, we aimed to identify the full length sequence of medaka (Oryzias latipes) rnf38 mRNA and investigate its association with the serotonergic system using an antidepressant, citalopram (CIT). We identified the full length rnf38 cDNA, which consisted of 2726 nucleotides spanning 12 exons and the deduced protein sequence consisting of 518 amino acid residues including a RING finger domain, a KIT motif and a coiled-coil domain. Medaka exposed to 10−7 M of CIT showed anxiety-like behavior. The expressions of 5-HT-related genes, pet1, solute carrier family 6, member 4A (slc6a4) and tryptophan hydroxylase (tph2) were significantly low (P &lt; 0.05) in the hindbrain. On the other hand, rnf38 gene was significantly high (P &lt; 0.05) in the telencephalon and the hypothalamus. This shows that 5-HT synthesis and transport in the hindbrain is suppressed by CIT, which induces rnf38 gene expression in the forebrain where 5-HT neurons project. Thus, the expression of rnf38 is negatively regulated by the serotonergic system.

AB  - Abstract
When comparing motor performance of the dominant and nondominant hands, older adults tend to be less asymmetric compared to young adults. This has suggested decreased motor lateralization and functional compensation within the aging brain. The current study further addressed this question by testing whether motor asymmetry was reduced in a sample of 44 healthy right-handed adults ages 65–89. We hypothesized that the older the age, the less the motor asymmetry, and that ‘old old’ participants (age 80+) would have less motor asymmetry than ‘young old’ participants (age 65–79). Using two naturalistic tasks that selectively biased the dominant or nondominant hands, we compared asymmetries in performance (measured as a ratio) across chronological age. Results showed preserved motor asymmetry across ages in both tasks, with no difference in asymmetry ratios in the ‘old old’ compared to the ‘young old.’ In the context of previous work, our findings suggest that the aging brain may also be characterized by additional measures besides chronological age.

AB  - Abstract
Whether visceral organ cross-sensitization is involved in endometriosis-associated pain remains elusive. Previous studies have shown that visceral noxious stimuli may trigger a cascade of signal transductions in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) via the spinal dorsal column (DC) pathway and the RVM plays a critical role in the descending control of visceral nociception. In the current study, we hypothesized that the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation in the RVM by noxious visceral inputs from ectopic growths via the DC was involved in the development of pelvic organ cross-sensitization in established endometriosis. A rat model of experimental endometriosis was established. To examine ectopic growths-to-colon cross-sensitization, graded colorectal distention (CRD) was performed and abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) scores were recorded in female rats at 8 weeks after the uterine or fat (control) auto-transplantation. Western blot study was carried out to examine the phosphorylated form and the total level of p38 MAPK protein in the RVM. Our results showed that lesions of bilateral DCs immediately following uterine or fat auto-transplantation in female rats significantly attenuated the later development of ectopic growths-to-colon cross-sensitization and the increased p38 MAPK activation in the RVM, as compared to sham DC lesions. Furthermore, intra-RVM microinjection of a p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB 203580), but not vehicle, in female rats with established endometriosis significantly attenuated ectopic growths-to-colon cross-sensitization and the increased activation of p38 MAPK in the RVM. These findings suggest that the noxious inputs from ectopic growths may activate p38 MAPK in the RVM via the DC, which may contribute to the development of ectopic growths-to-colon cross-sensitization in established endometriosis.

AB  - Abstract
Calcium ion accumulation into the cytosol of the hippocampus and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) are main reasons in etiology of epilepsy. Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) channel is a cation-permeable calcium channel found in the DRG and hippocampus. Although previous studies implicate TRPV1 channels in the generation of epilepsy, suppression of ongoing seizures by TRPV1 antagonists has not yet been investigated. We tested the effects of TRPV1-specific antagonists, capsazepine (CPZ) and 5′-iodoresiniferatoxin (IRTX) on the modulation of calcium accumulation, apoptosis and anticonvulsant properties in the hippocampus and DRG of pentylentetrazol (PTZ) and capsaicin (CAP) administrated rats.

Forty rats were divided into five groups as follows; control, PTZ, CAP + PTZ, IRTX, and IRTX + PTZ. Fura-2 and patch-clamp experiments were performed on neurons dissected from treated animals by CAP and CPZ. PTZ and CAP + PTZ administrations increased intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations, TRPV1 current densities, apoptosis, caspase 3 and 9 values although the values were reduced by IRTX and CPZ treatments. Latency time was extended by application CPZ and IRTX although CAP produced acceleration of epileptic seizures.

Taken together, these results support a role for TRPV1 channels in the inhibition of apoptosis, epileptic seizures and calcium accumulation, indicating that TRPV1 inhibition may possibly be a novel target in the DRG and hippocampus for prevention of epileptic seizures and peripheral pain.

AB  - Abstract
Modulation of actin and microtubule (MT) dynamics in neurons is implicated in guidance cue-dependent axon outgrowth, branching and pathfinding. Although the role of MTs in axon guidance has been well known, how extracellular guidance signals engage MT behavior in axon branching remains unclear. Previously, we have shown that TUBB3, the most dynamic β-tubulin isoform in neurons, directly binds to deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) to regulate MT dynamics in Netrin-1-mediated axon guidance. Here, we report that TUBB3 directly interacted with another Netrin-1 receptor Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM) and Netrin-1 increased this interaction in primary neurons. MT dynamics were required for Netrin-1-promoted association of DSCAM with TUBB3. Knockdown of either DSCAM or DCC or addition of a function blocking anti-DCC antibody mutually blocked Netrin-1-induced interactions, suggesting that DSCAM interdependently coordinated with DCC in Netrin-1-induced binding to TUBB3. Both DSCAM and DCC were partially colocalized with TUBB3 in the axon branch and the axon branching point of primary neurons and Netrin-1 increased these colocalizations. Netrin-1 induced the interaction of endogenous DSCAM with polymerized TUBB3 in primary neurons and Src family kinases (SFKs) were required for regulating this binding. Knockdown of DSCAM only, DCC only or both was sufficient to block Netrin-1-induced axon branching of E15 mouse cortical neurons. Knocking down TUBB3 inhibited Netrin-1 induced axon branching as well. These results suggest that DSCAM collaborates with DCC to regulate MT dynamics via direct binding to dynamic TUBB3 in Netrin-1-induced axon branching.

AB  - Abstract
Humans and other animals show a remarkable capacity for resilience following traumatic, stressful events. Resilience is thought to be an active process related to coping with stress, although the cellular and molecular mechanisms that support active coping and stress resistance remain poorly understood. In this review, we focus on the neurobiological mechanisms by which environmental and social experiences promote stress resistance. In male Syrian hamsters, exposure to a brief social defeat stressor leads to increased avoidance of novel opponents, which we call conditioned defeat. Also, hamsters that have achieved dominant social status show reduced conditioned defeat as well as cellular and molecular changes in the neural circuits controlling the conditioned defeat response. We propose that experience-dependent neural plasticity occurs in the prelimbic (PL) cortex, infralimbic (IL) cortex, and ventral medial amygdala (vMeA) during the maintenance of dominance relationships, and that adaptations in these neural circuits support stress resistance in dominant individuals. Overall, behavioral treatments that promote success in competitive interactions may represent valuable interventions for instilling resilience.

AB  - Abstract
The ability to selectively control the differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) into cholinergic neurons in vivo would be an important step toward cell replacement therapy. First, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-NSCs were induced to differentiate into cholinergic neuron-like cells (CNLs) with retinoic acid (RA) pre-induction followed by nerve growth factor (NGF) induction. Then, these CNLs were transplanted into bilateral hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Behavioral parameters showed by Morris water maze (MWM) tests and the percentages of GFP-labeled cholinergic neurons of CNL transplanted mice were compared with those of controls. Brain levels of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) mRNA and proteins were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting, ChAT activity and acetylcholine (ACh) concentration were also evaluated by ChAT activity and ACh concentration assay kits. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that 80.3 ± 1.5% NSCs differentiated into CNLs after RA pre-induction followed by NGF induction in vitro. Three months after transplantation, 82.4 ± 6.3% CNLs differentiated into cholinergic neurons in vivo. APP/PS1 mice transplanted with CNLs showed a significant improvement in learning and memory ability compared with control groups at different time points. Furthermore, CNLs transplantation dramatically increased in the expressions of ChAT mRNA and protein, as well ChAT activity and ACh concentration in APP/PS1 mice. Our findings support the prospect of using NSC-derived CNLs in developing therapies for Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

AB  - Abstract
Repeated stress can elicit symptoms of depression and anxiety. The amygdala is a significant contributor to the expression of emotion and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a major target for the effects of stress on emotion. The adolescent time period may be particularly susceptible to the effects of stress on emotion. While repeated stress has been demonstrated to modify the morphology of BLA neurons in adult rats, little is known about its effects on BLA neurons during adolescence. This study tests the effects of repeated stress during adolescence on BLA neuronal morphology, and whether these are similar to the effects of stress during adulthood. The BLA includes the basal (BA) and lateral (LAT) nuclei, which are differentially responsive to stress in adults. Therefore, effects of stress during adolescence were compared between the BA and LAT nuclei. Morphological features of reconstructed BLA neurons were examined using Golgi–Cox-stained tissue from control or repeated restraint stress-exposed rats. We found subtle dendritic growth coupled with loss of spines after repeated stress during adolescence. The magnitude and dendritic location of these differences varied between the BA and LAT nuclei in strong contrast to the stress-induced increases in spine number seen in adults. These results demonstrate that repeated stress during adolescence has markedly different effects on BLA neuronal morphology, and the extent of these changes is BLA nucleus-dependent. Moreover, altered neuroanatomy was associated with age-dependent effects of repeated stress on generalization of fear, and may point to the necessity for different approaches to target stress-induced changes in adolescents.

AB  - Abstract
Injury potential, which refers to a direct current voltage between intact and injured nerve ends, is mainly caused by injury-induced Ca2+ influx. Our previous studies revealed that injury potential increased with the onset and severity of spinal cord injury (SCI), and an application of applied electric field stimulation (EFS) with the cathode distal to the lesion could delay and attenuate injury potential formation. As Ca2+ influx is also considered as a major trigger for secondary injury after SCI, we hypothesize that EFS would protect an injured spinal cord from secondary injury and consequently improve functional and pathological outcomes. In this study, rats were divided into three groups: (1) sham group, laminectomy only; (2) control group, subjected to SCI only; and (3) EFS group, received EFS immediately post-injury with the injury potential modulated to 0 ± 0.5 mV by EFS. Functional recovery of the hind limbs was assessed using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor scale. Results revealed that EFS-treated rats exhibited significantly better locomotor function recovery. Luxol fast blue staining was performed to assess the spared myelin area. Immunofluorescence was used to observe the number of myelinated nerve fibers. Ultrastructural analysis was performed to evaluate the size of myelinated nerve fibers. Findings showed that the EFS group rats exhibited significantly less myelin loss and had larger and more myelinated nerve fibers than the control group rats in dorsal corticospinal tract (dCST) 8 weeks after SCI. Furthermore, we found that EFS inhibited the activation of calpain and caspase-3, as well as the expression of Bax, as detected by Western blot analysis. Moreover, EFS decreased cellular apoptosis, as measured by TUNEL, within 4 weeks post-injury. Results suggest that early EFS could significantly reduce spinal cord degeneration and improve functional and historical recovery. Furthermore, these neuroprotective effects may be related to the inhibition of secondary apoptotic responses after SCI. These findings support further investigation of the future clinical application of EFS after SCI.

AB  - Abstract
It is believed that phase synchronization facilitates neural communication and neural plasticity throughout the hippocampal–cortical network, and further supports cognition and memory. The pathway from the ventral hippocampus to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is thought to play a significant role in emotional memory processing. Therefore, the information transmission on the pathway was hypothesized to be disrupted in the depressive state, which could be related to its impaired synaptic plasticity. In this study, local field potentials (LFPs) from both ventral CA1 (vCA1) and mPFC were recorded in both normal and chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) model rats under urethane anesthesia. LFPs of all rats were recorded before and after the long-term potentiation (LTP) induced on the vCA1–mPFC pathway in order to figure out the correlation of oscillatory synchronization of LFPs and synaptic plasticity. Our results showed the vCA1-to-mPFC unidirectional phase coupling of the theta rhythm, rather than the power of either region, was significantly enhanced by LTP induction, with less enhancement in the CUS model rats compared to that in the normal rats. In addition, theta phase coupling was positively correlated with synaptic plasticity on vCA1–mPFC pathway. Moreover, the theta-slow gamma phase–amplitude coupling in vCA1 was long-term enhanced after high frequency stimulation. These results suggest that the impaired synaptic plasticity in vCA1–mPFC pathway could be reflected by the attenuated theta phase coupling and theta–gamma cross frequency coupling of LFPs in the depression state.

AB  - Abstract
Caffeine works through a variety of complex mechanisms to exert an often bidirectional set of functional and structural neurological changes in vertebrates. We investigated the effects of chronic caffeine exposure on functional recovery of the dorsal light reflex (DLR) in hemilabyrinthectomized common goldfish, Carassius auratus. In this lesion model, the unilateral removal of the vestibular organs results in a temporary loss of gravitationally modulated postural control which is quantifiable via the DLR. We compared the functional recovery over 24 days of post-surgery goldfish continuously held in a caffeine solution of 2.5 mg/L (n = 10), 5.0 mg/L (n = 10), 10.0 mg/L (n = 11), or 0.0 mg/L control (n = 9). Comparison to a sham surgery group (n = 11) indicated statistically significant changes in the DLR of all hemilabyrinthectomized fish on day 1. The control group recovered over the study period and approached, but did not reach sham surgery DLR. Although the caffeine-treated fishes appeared to initiate some postural recovery within the first 2 weeks, beginning on day 10, all caffeine groups diverged from the control group with a deterioration of postural control. All three caffeine groups were significantly deficient in comparison with the control on days 10–24. These results suggest that caffeine exposure can at first be benign, but that high dosage or prolonged exposure hinders functional recovery.

Using ERP adaptation paradigms, studies have shown that the N170 adaptation effect is a stable phenomenon for both faces and words. However, the N170 adaptation effect for repeated identity remains unclear, so we have addressed this with two experiments. In Experiment 1, we investigated the face-related N170 repeated adaptation effect in a short interstimulus interval (ISI) and found that the N170 response elicited by faces was smaller when preceded by a same face adaptor than by another face adaptor. Experiment 2 addressed whether this repeated N170 adaptation effect generalizes to words. For the first time, the results indicated that the N170 response elicited by words was larger with a different word as an adaptor relative to the same word as an adaptor. Our results demonstrate that the face-related N170 response is sensitive to visual face features and extend the characteristics of N170 with the sensitivity to repeated items to other familiar objects of expertise (i.e. words). The results also suggest that there are some common characteristics between faces and words in the early perceptual processing.

AB  - Abstract
Diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) is a devastating complication of diabetes. The underlying pathogenesis of DPN is still elusive and an effective treatment devoid of side effects presents a challenge. There is evidence that in type-1 and -2 diabetes, metabolic and morphological changes lead to peripheral nerve damage and altered central nociceptive transmission, which may contribute to neuropathic pain symptoms. We characterized the electrophysiological response properties of spinal wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons in three diabetic models. The streptozotocin (STZ) model was used as a drug-induced model of type-1 diabetes, and the BioBreeding/Worcester (BB/Wor) and Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat models were used for genetic DPN models. Data were compared to the respective control group (BB/Wor diabetic-resistant, Zucker lean (ZL) and saline-injected Wistar rat). Response properties of WDR neurons to mechanical stimulation and spontaneous activity were assessed. We found abnormal response properties of spinal WDR neurons in all diabetic rats but not controls. Profound differences between models were observed. In BB/Wor diabetic rats evoked responses were increased, while in ZDF rats spontaneous activity was increased and in STZ rats mainly after discharges were increased. The abnormal response properties of neurons might indicate differential pathological, diabetes-induced, changes in spinal neuronal transmission. This study shows for the first time that specific electrophysiological response properties are characteristic for certain models of DPN and that these might reflect the diverse and complex symptomatology of DPN in the clinic.

AB  - Abstract
Yerba-mate (Ilex paraguariensis St. Hil.) is the most used beverage in Latin America with approximately 426 thousand of tons consumed per year. Considering the broad use of this plant, we aimed to investigate the anxiety-like and stimulant activity of both the hydroethanolic (HE) and aqueous (AE) extracts from leaves of I. paraguariensis. Swiss mice were treated with I. paraguariensis HE or AE chronically or acutely, respectively, followed by evaluation in the elevated plus-maze (EPM; anxiety-like paradigm), open field (OF; locomotor activity) or the step-down avoidance task (memory assessment). Following behavioral protocols the brains were collected for evaluation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity ex vivo. Chronic treatment with HE induced an anxiolytic-like effect and increased motor activity besides augmented AChE activity. Additionally, acute treatment with AE prevented the scopolamine-induced memory deficit in the step-down avoidance task. Overall, our results indicate the importance of the I. paraguariensis-induced CNS effects, since it is a widely used nutraceutical. We have reported anxiolytic, stimulant and neuroprotective effects for this plant species. These effects are potentially modulated by the cholinergic system as well as by caffeine.

AB  - Abstract
Epilepsy can be defined as the abnormal activities of neurons. The occurrence, propagation and termination of epileptic seizures rely on the networks of neuronal cells that are connected through both synaptic- and non-synaptic interactions. These complicated interactions contain the modified functions of normal neurons and glias as well as the mediation of excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms with feedback homeostasis. Numerous spread patterns are detected in disparate networks of ictal activities. The cortical–thalamic–cortical loop is present during a general spike wave seizure. The thalamic reticular nucleus (nRT) is the major inhibitory input traversing the region, and the dentate gyrus (DG) controls CA3 excitability. The imbalance between γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic inhibition and glutamatergic excitation is the main disorder in epilepsy. Adjustable negative feedback that mediates both inhibitory and excitatory components affects neuronal networks through neurotransmission fluctuation, receptor and transmitter signaling, and through concomitant influences on ion concentrations and field effects. Within a limited dynamic range, neurons slowly adapt to input levels and have a high sensitivity to synaptic changes. The stability of the adapting network depends on the ratio of the adaptation rates of both the excitatory and inhibitory populations. Thus, therapeutic strategies with multiple effects on seizures are required for the treatment of epilepsy, and the therapeutic functions on networks are reviewed here. Based on the high-energy burst theory of epileptic activity, we propose a potential antiepileptic therapeutic strategy to transfer the high energy and extra electricity out of the foci.

AB  - Abstract
Since the discovery that long-term memory is dependent on protein synthesis, several transcription factors have been found to participate in the transcriptional activity needed for its consolidation. Among them, NF-kappa B is a constitutive transcription factor whose nuclear activity has proven to be necessary for the consolidation of inhibitory avoidance in mice. This transcription factor has a wide distribution in the nervous system, with a well-reported presence in dendrites and synaptic terminals. Here we report changes in synaptosomal NF-kappa B localization and activity, during long-term memory consolidation. Activity comparison of synaptosomal and nuclear NF-kappa B, indicates different dynamics for both localizations. In this study we identify two pools of synaptosomal NF-kappa B, one obtained with the synaptoplasm (free fraction) and the second bound to the synaptosomal membranes. During the early steps of consolidation the first pool is activated, as the membrane associated transcription factor fraction increases and concomitantly the free fraction decreases. These results suggest that the activation of synaptic NF-kappa B and its translocation to membranes are part of the consolidation of long-term memory in mice.

AB  - Abstract
Local circuits within the striatum of the basal ganglia include a small number of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic fast-spiking interneurons (FSI). The number of these cells is reduced in disorders of behavioral control, but it is unknown whether this is accompanied by altered electrophysiological properties. The genetically hypertensive (GH) rat strain exhibits impulsiveness and hyperactivity. We investigated if resting-state FSI activity is affected in this strain using extracellular recordings. We also examined the effect of systemic amphetamine (AMPH), a stimulant drug used in the treatment of these particular behavioral deficits. Putative FSI (pFSI) were encountered less often in GH rats compared to the Wistar control strain. pFSI in GH rats also exhibited a higher mean firing rate, higher intraburst firing rate, lower interburst interval, and shorter bursts compared to controls. AMPH increased the mean overall firing rate of Wistar rat pFSI but did not significantly alter the firing properties of this subtype in GH rats. These differences in the resting-state electrophysiological activity of pFSI in GH rats point to them as a cell type of particular interest in understanding striatal functioning across different strains.

AB  - Abstract
A GABA-site agonist gaboxadol (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol) at 3 mg/kg induces strong anxiolytic response in a transgenic Thy1α6 mouse line ectopically expressing the GABAA receptor α6 subunit gene under the Thy-1.2 promoter. Now, we compared brain activation patterns between Thy1α6 and wild-type mice to identify brain structures potentially mediating this anxiolytic response. Acutely efficient anxiolytics such as benzodiazepines typically depress most brain regions while activating specifically neurons within the central extended amygdala. Gaboxadol treatment (3 mg/kg, i.p., 2 h) induced a significant increase in c-Fos expression selectively in many Thy1α6 brain regions including the limbic cortex, anterior olfactory nucleus, septal area and central and basolateral nuclei of amygdala. It failed to activate the lateral part of mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MDL) in the Thy1α6 mice that was activated in the wild-type mice. Detailed mapping of the α6 subunit mRNA by in situ hybridization revealed expression in the middle layers of the isocortex, olfactory areas, hippocampal formation and basolateral nucleus of amygdala (BLA) in the Thy1α6 forebrain. The ligand autoradiographies (t-butylbicyclophosphoro[35S]thionate ([35S]TBPS) and [3H]Ro 15-4513) revealed high levels of pharmacologically active extrasynaptic α6β and α6βγ2 GABAA receptors in these same areas. However, c-Fos induction by gaboxadol treatment in Thy1α6 brain was not restricted to areas highly expressing the α6-containing GABAA receptors suggesting that indirect pathways lead to the paradoxically widespread activation. Interestingly, the activation pattern by gaboxadol at the dose that is anxiolytic in Thy1α6 mice resembled closely that observed after various fear- and stress-provoking challenges. However, our results are consistent with a recent observation that optogenetic activation of specific neuronal pathways in the extended amygdala mediates anxiolytic responses. Our results suggest that the widespread neuronal inhibition as typically associated with benzodiazepines is not the exclusive mechanism of anxiolysis.

AB  - Abstract
Proteomic profiles of the thalamus and the correlation between the rats’ performance on a spatial learning task and differential protein expression were assessed in the thiamine deficiency (TD) rat model of Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome. Two-dimensional gel-electrophoresis detected 320 spots and a significant increase or decrease in seven proteins. Four proteins were correlated to rat behavioral performance in the Morris Water Maze. One of the four proteins was identified by mass spectrometry as Voltage-Dependent Anion Channels (VDACs). The association of VDAC is evident in trials in which the rats’ performance was worst, in which the VDAC protein was reduced, as confirmed by Western blot. No difference was observed on the mRNA of Vdac genes, indicating that the decreased VDAC expression may be related to a post-transcriptional process. The results show that TD neurodegeneration involves changes in thalamic proteins and suggest that VDAC protein activity might play an important role in an initial stage of the spatial learning process.

AB  - Abstract
Neuropathic pain is a severe clinical problem, often appearing as a co-symptom of many diseases or manifesting as a result of damage to the nervous system. Many drugs and agents are currently used for the treatment of neuropathic pain, such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). The aims of this paper were to test the effects of two classic TCAs, doxepin and amitriptyline, in naïve animals and in a model of neuropathic pain and to determine the role of cytokine activation in the effects of these drugs. All experiments were carried out with Albino-Swiss mice using behavioral tests (von Frey test and the cold plate test) and biochemical analyses (qRT-PCR and Western blot). In the mice subjected to chronic constriction injury (CCI), doxepin and amitriptyline attenuated the symptoms of neuropathic pain and diminished the CCI-induced increase in the levels of spinal interleukin (IL)-6 and -1β mRNA, but not the protein levels of these cytokines, measured on day 12. Unexpectedly, chronic administration of doxepin or amitriptyline for 12 days produced allodynia and hyperalgesia in naïve mice. The treatment with these drugs did not influence the spinal levels of IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA, however, the protein levels of these pronociceptive factors were increased. The administration of ondansetron (5-HT3 receptor antagonist) significantly weakened the allodynia and hyperalgesia induced by both antidepressants in naïve mice; in contrast, yohimbine (α2-adrenergic receptors antagonist) did not influence these effects. Allodynia and hyperalgesia induced in naïve animals by amitriptyline and doxepin may be associated with an increase in the levels of pronociceptive cytokines resulting from 5-HT3-induced hypersensitivity. Our results provide new and important information about the possible side effects of antidepressants. Further investigation of these mechanisms may help to guide decisions about the use of classic TCAs for therapy.

AB  - Abstract
Neurobiological and genetic mechanisms underlying increased intake of and preference for nutritive sugars over non-nutritive sweeteners are not fully understood. We examined the roles of subnuclei of the amygdala in the shift in preference for a nutritive sugar. Food-deprived mice alternately received caloric sucrose (1.0 M) on odd-numbered training days and a non-caloric artificial sweetener (2.5 mM saccharin) on even-numbered training days. During training, mice with sham lesions of the basolateral (BLA) or central (CeA) nucleus of the amygdala increased their intake of 1.0 M sucrose, but not saccharin. Trained mice with sham lesions showed a significant shift in preference toward less concentrated sucrose (0.075 M) over the saccharin in a two-bottle choice test, although the mice showed an equivalent preference for these sweeteners before training. No increased intake of or preference for sucrose before and after the alternating training was observed in non-food-deprived mice. Excitotoxic lesions centered in the BLA impaired the increase in 1.0 M sucrose intake and shift in preference toward 0.075 M sucrose over saccharin. Microlesions with iontophoretic excitotoxin injections into the CeA did not block the training-dependent changes. These results suggest that food-deprived animals selectively shift their preference for a caloric sugar over a non-caloric sweetener through the alternate consumption of caloric and non-caloric sweet substances. The present data also suggest that the BLA, but not CeA, plays a role in the selective shift in sweetener preference.

AB  - Abstract
In the spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model of neuropathic pain, as in other pain models, abnormal spontaneous activity of myelinated sensory neurons occurs early and is essential for establishing pain behaviors and other pathologies. Sympathetic sprouting into the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) is observed after SNL, and sympathectomy reduces pain behavior. Sprouting and spontaneous activity may be mutually reinforcing: blocking neuronal activity reduces sympathetic sprouting, and sympathetic spouts functionally increase spontaneous activity in vitro. However, most studies in this field have used nonspecific methods to block spontaneous activity, methods that also block evoked and normal activity. In this study, we injected small inhibitory (si) RNA directed against the NaV1.6 sodium channel isoform into the DRG before SNL. This isoform can mediate high-frequency repetitive firing, like that seen in spontaneously active neurons. Local knockdown of NaV1.6 markedly reduced mechanical pain behaviors induced by SNL, reduced sympathetic sprouting into the ligated sensory ganglion, and blocked abnormal spontaneous activity and other measures of hyperexcitability in myelinated neurons in the ligated sensory ganglion. Immunohistochemical experiments showed that sympathetic sprouting preferentially targeted NaV1.6-positive neurons. Under these experimental conditions, NaV1.6 knockdown did not prevent or strongly alter single evoked action potentials, unlike previous less specific methods used to block spontaneous activity. NaV1.6 knockdown also reduced pain behaviors in another pain model, chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve, provided the model was modified so that the lesion site was relatively close to the siRNA-injected lumbar DRGs. The results highlight the relative importance of abnormal spontaneous activity in establishing both pain behaviors and sympathetic sprouting, and suggest that the NaV1.6 isoform may have value as a therapeutic target.

AB  - Abstract
In rodents, chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure (CIE) produces alcohol dependence, alters the structure and activity of pyramidal neurons and decreases the number of oligodendroglial progenitors in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). In this study, adult Wistar rats were exposed to seven weeks of CIE and were withdrawn from CIE for 21 days (protracted abstinence; PA). Tissue enriched in the mPFC was processed for Western blot analysis and Golgi–Cox staining to investigate the long-lasting effects of CIE on the structure of mPFC neurons and the levels of myelin-associated proteins. PA increased dendritic arborization within apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons. These changes occurred concurrently with hypophosphorylation of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor 2B (NR2B) at Tyr-1472. PA increased myelin basic protein (MBP) levels which occurred concurrently with hypophosphorylation of the premyelinating oligodendrocyte bHLH transcription factor Olig2 in the mPFC. Given that PA is associated with increased sensitivity to stress and hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation, and stress alters oligodendrocyte expression as a function of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation, the levels of total GR and phosphorylated GR were also evaluated. PA produced hypophosphorylation of the GR at Ser-232 without affecting expression of total protein. These findings demonstrate persistent and compensatory effects of ethanol in the mPFC long after cessation of CIE, including enhanced myelin production and impaired GR function. Collectively, these results suggest a novel relationship between oligodendrocytes and GR in the mPFC, in which stress may alter frontal cortex function in alcohol dependent subjects by promoting hypermyelination, thereby altering the cellular composition and white matter structure in the mPFC.

AB  - Abstract
Extensive pharmacological evidence supports the idea that glutamate plays a key role in both acute and chronic pain. In the present study, we investigated the implication of the excitatory amino acid in physiological nociception by using mutant mice deficient in phosphate-activated glutaminase type 1 (GLS1), the enzyme that synthesizes glutamate in central glutamatergic neurons. Because homozygous GLS1−/− mutants die shortly after birth, assays for assessing mechanical, thermal and chemical (formalin) nociception were performed on heterozygous GLS1+/− mutants, which present a clear-cut decrease in glutamate synthesis in central neurons. As compared to paired wild-type mice, adult male GLS1+/− mutants showed decreased responsiveness to mechanical (von Frey filament and tail-pressure, but not tail-clip, tests) and thermal (Hargreaves’ plantar, tail-immersion and hot-plate tests) nociceptive stimuli. Genotype-related differences were also found in the formalin test for which GLS1+/− mice exhibited marked decreases in the nociceptive responses (hindlimb lift, lick and flinch) during both phase 1 (0–5 min) and phase 2 (16–45 min) after formalin injection. On the other hand, acute treatment with memantine (1 mg/kg i.p.), an uncompetitive antagonist at NMDA glutamate receptors, reduced nociception responses in wild-type but not GLS1+/− mice. Conversely, antinociceptive response to acute administration of a low dose (1 mg/kg s.c.) of morphine was significantly larger in GLS1+/− mutants versus wild-type mice. Our findings indicate that genetically driven hypoactivity of central glutamatergic neurotransmission renders mice hyposensitive to nociceptive stimulations, and promotes morphine antinociception, further emphasizing the critical role of glutamate in physiological nociception and its opioid-mediated control.

Ginseng serves as a potential candidate for the treatment of aging-related memory decline or memory loss. However, the related mechanism is not fully understood. In this study, we applied an intraperitoneal injection of ginsenoside Rg1, an active compound from ginseng in middle-aged mice and detected memory improvement and the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that a period of 30-day administration of ginsenoside Rg1 enhanced long-term memory in the middle-aged animals. Consistent with the memory improvement, ginsenoside Rg1 administration facilitated weak theta-burst stimulation (TBS)-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in acute hippocampal slices from middle-aged animals. Ginsenoside Rg1 administration increased the dendritic apical spine numbers and area in the CA1 region. In addition, ginsenoside Rg1 administration up-regulated the expression of hippocampal p-AKT, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), proBDNF and glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1), but not p-ERK. Interestingly, the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) inhibitor (bpV) mimicked the ginsenoside Rg1 effects, including increasing p-AKT expression, promoting hippocampal basal synaptic transmission, LTP and memory. Taken together, our data suggest that ginsenoside Rg1 treatment improves memory in middle-aged mice possibly through regulating the PI3K/AKT pathway, altering apical spines and facilitating hippocampal LTP.

AB  - Abstract
Given the detection of aggregated deposits in chronic mental diseases (CMD), the disturbance of proteostasis in those diseases is receiving increasing attention. The study of aggregated proteins can contribute to our understanding of the chronic and progressive condition of such diseases. Dysbindin, encoded by the schizophrenia susceptibility gene DTNBP1, has been reported to co-aggregate with DISC1. However, there has been no evidence to date on the aggregation tendency of dysbindin. Therefore, we investigated the isoform-specific aggregation of dysbindin. We found that dysbindin-1B aggregated into cell-invasive deposits in mice. Because of the efficient propagation of dysbindin-1B, we further studied the mechanism of propagation and identified it as exosome-mediated transmission of the aggregates. In addition, aggregates of dysbindin-1B were toxic. Through exosome-mediated propagation, the deposits of dysbindin-1B exerted toxic effects on recipient neurons a long distance away from the initial aggregation site in mice brain. The rapid long distance propagation of neurotoxic deposits of dysbindin-1B in affected neuronal circuitry indicates a possible mechanism for the progressive deterioration of neurons and cognitive function in CMD.

AB  - Abstract
Epilepsy is a disease of neuronal hyper-synchrony that can involve both neocortical and hippocampal brain regions. While much is known about the network properties of the hippocampus little is known of how epileptic neocortical hyper-synchrony develops. We aimed at characterizing the properties of epileptic discharges of a neocortical epileptic focus.

We established a multi-electrode-array method to record the spatial patterns of epileptiform potentials in acute adult rat brain slices evoked by 4-Aminopyridine in the absence of magnesium.

Locations of discharges mapped to two anatomical regions over the somatosensory cortex and over the lateral convexity separated by a gap at a location matching the dysgranular zone. Focal epileptiform discharges were recorded in superficial and deep neocortical layers but over superficial layers, they exhibited larger surface areas. They were often independent even when closely spaced to one another but they became progressively coupled resulting in larger zones of coherent discharge.

The gradual coupling of multiple, independent, closely spaced, spatially restricted, focal discharges between deep and superficial neocortical layers represents a possible mechanism of the development of an epileptogenic zone.

AB  - Abstract
Nicotine has been shown to attenuate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) through inhibiting inflammation in microglial populations during the disease course. In this study, we investigated whether nicotine modified the regenerative process in EAE by examining nestin-expressing neural stem cells (NSCs) in the spinal cord, which is the primary area of demyelination and inflammation in EAE. Our results show that the endogenous neurogenic responses in the spinal cord after EAE are limited and delayed: while nestin expression is increased, the proliferation of ependymal cells is inhibited compared to healthy animals. Nicotine application significantly reduced nestin expression and partially allowed for the proliferation of ependymal cells. We found that reduction of ependymal cell proliferation correlated with inflammation in the same area, which was relieved by the administration of nicotine. Further, increased numbers of oligodendrocytes (OLs) were observed after nicotine treatment. These findings give a new insight into the mechanism of how nicotine functions to attenuate EAE.

AB  - Abstract
The lethal disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the loss of somatic motor neurons. However, not all motor neurons are equally vulnerable to disease; certain groups are spared, including those in the oculomotor nucleus controlling eye movement. The reasons for this differential vulnerability remain unknown. Here we have identified a protein signature for resistant oculomotor motor neurons and vulnerable hypoglossal and spinal motor neurons in mouse and man and in health and ALS with the aim of understanding motor neuron resistance. Several proteins with implications for motor neuron resistance, including GABAA receptor α1, guanylate cyclase soluble subunit alpha-3 and parvalbumin were persistently expressed in oculomotor neurons in man and mouse. Vulnerable motor neurons displayed higher protein levels of dynein, peripherin and GABAA receptor α2, which play roles in retrograde transport and excitability, respectively. These were dynamically regulated during disease and thus could place motor neurons at an increased risk. From our analysis is it evident that oculomotor motor neurons have a distinct protein signature compared to vulnerable motor neurons in brain stem and spinal cord, which could in part explain their resistance to degeneration in ALS. Our comparison of human and mouse shows the relative conservation of signals across species and infers that transgenic SOD1G93A mice could be used to predict mechanisms of neuronal vulnerability in man.

AB  - Abstract
The primary visual cortex (V1) is the first step in visual information processing and its function may be modulated by acetylcholine through nicotinic receptors (nAChRs). Since our previous work demonstrated that visual acuity and cortical spatial resolution limit were significantly reduced in α7 knock-out (KO) mice in the absence of retinal alterations, we decided to characterize the contribution of homomeric α7 nicotinic receptors (α7nAChRs) to visual information processing at the cortical level. We evaluated long-term forms of synaptic plasticity in occipital slices containing V1 from α7 KO mice and in wild-type (WT) slices perfused with nAChRs selective blocking agents. In α7 KO mice slices, electrophysiological recordings demonstrated the absence of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in layer II/III after the stimulation of different intracortical pathways (layer IV or II/III). Furthermore, the acute and selective blockade of α7nAChRs in slices from WT mice with either α-bungarotoxin or methyllycaconitine did not alter the expression of LTP and LTD. Conversely, the perfusion with the unspecific nAChRs antagonist mecamylamine impaired LTP and LTD. Our results suggest the presence of impaired synaptic plasticity in the V1 of α7 KO mice and indicate a different contribution of nAChRs to visual cortex function.

AB  - Abstract
We recently developed ultra-sensitive ethanol receptors (USERs) as a novel tool for investigation of single receptor subunit populations sensitized to extremely low ethanol concentrations that do not affect other receptors in the nervous system. To this end, we found that mutations within the extracellular Loop 2 region of glycine receptors (GlyRs) and γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs) can significantly increase receptor sensitivity to micro-molar concentrations of ethanol resulting in up to a 100-fold increase in ethanol sensitivity relative to wild-type (WT) receptors. The current study investigated: (1) Whether structural manipulations of Loop 2 in α1 GlyRs could similarly increase receptor sensitivity to other anesthetics; and (2) If mutations exclusive to the C-terminal end of Loop 2 are sufficient to impart these changes. We expressed α1 GlyR USERs in Xenopus oocytes and tested the effects of three classes of anesthetics, isoflurane (volatile), propofol (intravenous), and lidocaine (local), known to enhance glycine-induced chloride currents using two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology. Loop 2 mutations produced a significant 10-fold increase in isoflurane and lidocaine sensitivity, but no increase in propofol sensitivity compared to WT α1 GlyRs. Interestingly, we also found that structural manipulations in the C-terminal end of Loop 2 were sufficient and selective for α1 GlyR modulation by ethanol, isoflurane, and lidocaine. These studies are the first to report the extracellular region of α1 GlyRs as a site of lidocaine action. Overall, the findings suggest that Loop 2 of α1 GlyRs is a key region that mediates isoflurane and lidocaine modulation. Moreover, the results identify important amino acids in Loop 2 that regulate isoflurane, lidocaine, and ethanol action. Collectively, these data indicate the commonality of the sites for isoflurane, lidocaine, and ethanol action, and the structural requirements for allosteric modulation on α1 GlyRs within the extracellular Loop 2 region.

AB  - Abstract
The cholinergic pathways, which originate in the basal forebrain and are responsible for the control of different cognitive processes including learning and memory, are also regulated by some neuropeptides. One of these neuropeptides, galanin (GAL), is involved in both neurotrophic and neuroprotective actions. The present study has evaluated in rats the effects on cognition induced by a subchronic treatment with GAL by analyzing the passive avoidance response, and the modulation of muscarinic cholinergic receptor densities and activities. [3H]-N-methyl-scopolamine, [3H]-oxotremorine, and [3H]-pirenzepine were used to quantify the density of muscarinic receptors (MRs) and the stimulation of the binding of guanosine 5′-(γ-[35S]thio)triphosphate by the muscarinic agonist, carbachol, to determine their functionality.

Some cognitive deficits that were induced by the administration of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) (i.c.v. aCSF 2 μl/min, once a day for 6 days) were not observed in the animals also treated with GAL (i.c.v. 1.5 mmol in aCSF, 2 μl/min, once a day for 6 days). GAL modulates the changes in M1 and M2 MR densities observed in the rats treated with aCSF, and also increased their activity mediated by Gi/o proteins in specific areas of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. The subchronic administration of the vehicle was also accompanied by an increased number of positive fibers and cells for GAL around the cortical tract of the cannula used, but that was not the case in GAL-treated rats. In addition, the increase of GAL receptor density in the ventral hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in the aCSF group was avoided when GAL was administered. The number of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-positive neurons was decreased in the nucleus basalis of Meynert of both GAL- and aCSF-treated animals. In summary, GAL improves memory-related abilities probably through the modulation of MR density and/or efficacy in hippocampal areas.

AB  - Abstract
Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug which has been reported to lessen the ischemic transcriptional effects in some of the glutamatergic system genes as well as to decrease the infarct volume in in vivo assays. In this study, we show how the presence of meloxicam decreases cell mortality in assays of oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) in rat organotypic hippocampal slices culture. Mortality was measured using propidium iodide. Transcript levels of some glutamatergic system genes, including vesicular and membrane glutamate transporters (VGLUT1, VGLUT2, GLAST-1A, GLT-1, and EAAC-1) and some glutamatergic receptor subunits (NMDA receptor, GluN1, GluN2A and GluN2B subunits and AMPA receptor, GluA1 and GluA2 subunits) were measured by real-time PCR (qPCR). The transcription of vesicular glutamate transporters and glutamatergic receptor subunits, but not membrane glutamate transporters, was modified by the presence of meloxicam. The study demonstrates the neuroprotective role of meloxicam in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures and shows how meloxicam is able to selectively increase or decrease the OGD-induced changes in the expression of the different glutamatergic system genes studied here. We suggest that the neuroprotective role of meloxicam could be due to a modification in the balance of the expression of some glutamatergic receptor subunits, leading to a different stoichiometry of receptors such as NMDA or AMPA. Thus, meloxicam would decrease the excitotoxicity induced by OGD.

AB  - Abstract
Genome-wide association studies have suggested a role for a genetic variation in the presynaptic gene PCLO in major depressive disorder (MDD). As with many complex traits, the PCLO variant has a small contribution to the overall heritability and the association does not always replicate. One variant (rs2522833, p.Ser4814Ala) is of particular interest given that it is a common, nonsynonymous exon variant near a calcium-sensing part of PCLO. It has been suggested that the molecular effects of such variations penetrate to a variable extent in the population due to phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity at the population level. More robust effects may be exposed by studying such variations in isolation, in a more homogeneous context. We tested this idea by modeling PCLO variation in a mouse knock-in model expressing the PcloSA/SA variant. In the highly homogeneous background of inbred mice, two functional effects of the SA-variation were observed at the cellular level: increased synaptic Piccolo levels, and 30% increased excitatory synaptic transmission in cultured neurons. Other aspects of Piccolo function were unaltered: calcium-dependent phospholipid binding, synapse formation in vitro, and synaptic accumulation of synaptic vesicles. Moreover, anxiety, cognition and depressive-like behavior were normal in PcloSA/SA mice. We conclude that the PCLO p.Ser4814Ala missense variant produces mild cellular phenotypes, which do not translate into behavioral phenotypes. We propose a model explaining how (subtle) cellular phenotypes do not penetrate to the mouse behavioral level but, due to genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity and non-linearity, can produce association signals in human population studies.

AB  - Abstract
The brain continues to develop through adolescence when excessive alcohol consumption is prevalent in humans. We hypothesized that binge drinking doses of ethanol during adolescence will cause changes in brain ethanol responses that persist into adulthood. To test this hypothesis Wistar rats were treated with an adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE; 5 g/kg, i.g. 2 days on–2 days off; P25–P54) model of underage drinking followed by 25 days of abstinence during maturation to young adulthood (P80). Using markers of neuronal activation c-Fos, EGR1, and phophorylated extracellar signal regulated kinase (pERK1/2), adult responses to a moderate and binge drinking ethanol challenge, e.g., 2 or 4 g/kg, were determined. Adult rats showed dose dependent increases in neuronal activation markers in multiple brain regions during ethanol challenge. Brain regional responses correlated are consistent with anatomical connections. AIE led to marked decreases in adult ethanol PFC (prefrontal cortex) and blunted responses in the amygdala. Binge drinking doses led to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) activation that correlated with the ventral tegmental area (VTA) activation. In contrast to other brain regions, AIE enhanced the adult NAc response to binge drinking doses. These studies suggest that adolescent alcohol exposure causes long-lasting changes in brain responses to alcohol that persist into adulthood.

AB  - Abstract
The medial parabrachial nucleus (MPB) and external part of the medial parabrachial nucleus (MPBE) relay gustatory, oral mechanosensory and other visceral information in the rat brain and reportedly project not only to the parvicellular part of the posteromedial ventral thalamic nucleus (VPMpc) but also to the ventrocaudal part of the intralaminar thalamic nuclei. Generally, the intralaminar thalamic nuclei project topographically to the caudate putamen (CPu); however, it is unclear where the ventrocaudal part of the intralaminar thalamic nuclei projects within the CPu. Thus, we visualized neural pathways from the MPB and MPBE to the CPu via the ventrocaudal part of the intralaminar thalamic nuclei using an anterograde tracer, biotinylated dextran amine, and a retrograde tracer, cholera toxin B subunit. We found that the MPB and MPBE sent a relatively stronger input to the ventrocaudal part of the intralaminar thalamic nuclei such as the oval paracentral thalamic nucleus (OPC), central medial thalamic nucleus (CM) and parafascicular thalamic nucleus (PF) and retroreuniens area (RRe) as compared to the VPMpc. In turn, these thalamic nuclei projected to the ventral part of the CPu with the topographical arrangement as follows: the OPC to the ventrocentral part of the CPu; ventrolateral part of the PF to the ventrolateral part of the CPu; and the caudal part of the CM, ventromedial part of the PF and RRe to the ventromedial part of the CPu. Further, we found that the VPMpc rather projected to the interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure than the CPu. The ventral part of the CPu is reported to be involved in jaw movement as well as food and water intake functions. Therefore, these parabrachio-thalamo-striatal pathways that we demonstrated here suggest that gustatory and oral mechanosensory information affects feeding behavior within the ventral part of the CPu.

AB  - Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative motor disorder in the world. The main causes of neurodegeneration in PD are mitochondrial impairment and oxidative stress promoted by dopamine (DA) metabolism in the cytosol. Protein l-isoaspartyl (d-aspartyl) methyltransferase (PIMT) is a protein repair enzyme with anti-apoptotic properties. We previously reported that PIMT was downregulated at both gene and protein levels by DA-induced oxidative stresses in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the anti-apoptotic function of PIMT toward DA-induced cell death to better understand its specific neuroprotective role. Overexpression of wild-type PIMT, in contrast to its inactive mutant, protected SH-SY5Y cells from cell death and caspase 3 activation upon DA treatments. The intrinsic pathway of apoptosis as measured by caspase 9 activity was triggered by reactive oxygen species produced from DA metabolism, and overexpression of wild-type PIMT completely prevented caspase 9 activity stimulated by DA. In addition, cells overexpressing wild-type PIMT produced significantly less reactive oxygen species despite DA treatment compared to cells that do not overexpress PIMT. Together, these data indicate that DA-associated PIMT downregulation is an important event contributing to neuronal cell death. More importantly, the PIMT anti-apoptotic capacity seems to be dependent on its involvement in the cellular antioxidant machinery.

AB  - Abstract
We recently reported that apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-deficient mice with a mutation in the fibrillin-1 gene (ApoE−/−Fbn1C1039G+/−) develop accelerated atherosclerosis with enhanced inflammation, atherosclerotic plaque rupture, myocardial infarction and sudden death. In the brain, fibrillin-1 functions as an attachment protein in the basement membrane, providing structural support to the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Here, we investigated whether fibrillin-1 impairment affects the permeability of the BBB proper and the blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB), and whether this leads to the accelerated accumulation of lipids (xanthomas) in the brain. ApoE−/− (n = 61) and ApoE−/−Fbn1C1039G+/− (n = 73) mice were fed a Western-type diet (WD). After 14 weeks WD, a significantly higher permeability of the BBB was observed in ApoE−/−Fbn1C1039G+/− mice compared to age-matched ApoE−/− mice. This was accompanied by leukocyte infiltration, enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases and transforming growth factor-β, and by decreased expression of tight junction proteins claudin-5 and occludin. After 20 weeks WD, 83% of ApoE−/−Fbn1C1039G+/− mice showed xanthomas in the brain, compared to 23% of their ApoE−/− littermates. Xanthomas were mainly located in fibrillin-1-rich regions, such as the choroid plexus and the neocortex. Our findings demonstrate that dysfunctional fibrillin-1 impairs BBB/BCSFB integrity, facilitating peripheral leukocyte infiltration, which further degrades the BBB/BCSFB. As a consequence, lipoproteins can enter the brain, resulting in accelerated formation of xanthomas.

AB  - Abstract
Methamphetamine (METH) is a psychostimulant that disrupts monoaminergic neurotransmission to evoke profound behavioral and physiological effects. Rapidly distributing to forebrain regions to increase synaptic concentrations of three monoamines (dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA)), the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is important in METH-altered behavioral and psychological profiles. Activation of the ventral mPFC can modify physiological variables, however, METH-evoked autonomic changes from this region are unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize the respiratory, metabolic and cardiovascular effects of microinjection of METH, DA, 5-HT and NA into the ventral mPFC in urethane-anesthetized Sprague–Dawley rats. METH and NA microinjection evoked dose-related increases in heart rate, interscapular brown adipose tissue temperature and expired CO2, a pattern of response characteristic of non-shivering thermogenesis. NA and 5-HT microinjection elicited pressor and depressor responses, respectively, with matching baroreflex adjustments in sympathetic nerve activity while METH and DA evoked no change in vasomotor outflow. Low doses of METH and DA may evoke respiratory depression. These data suggest that METH’s actions in the ventral mPFC, likely via adrenergic receptors, evoke non-shivering thermogenesis which may contribute to the increased body temperature and tachycardia seen in those that abuse METH.

AB  - AbstractObjectives
Compared to other senses, temporal perception of odors seems fairly slow. In addition it has been shown in previous studies that even not consciously perceived odors could influence our behavior. Aim of the current study therefore was to study the interstimulus interval (ISI) length, which is necessary between two repetitive stimuli to be able to perceive them separately. The additional aim focused on observing central odor processing of not perceived odorous stimuli. Materials and methods: The study was divided into three parts. In each part healthy, normosmic volunteers were included. In part I and II stimulus pairs (CO2, H2S, orange and phenyl ethyl alcohol (PEA)) were presented to the subjects via a computer-controlled olfactometer with short ISI of 0.6–9 s. The decision whether one or two stimuli were perceived was recorded. In addition the influence of odor valence, trigeminallity and concentrations was observed. In part III olfactory event-related potentials (OERPs) to perceived and not-perceived odors were recorded. Results: The two stimuli of a stimulus pair were perceived separately more often with increasing ISI length. This increase was significant until an ISI between the stimuli of 4 s. Odor intensity, pleasantness, trigeminallity and sex had no major influence on this. In addition we were able to observe that OERPs are less often detected in response to not perceived olfactory stimuli. However, the presence of OERP in response to not perceived stimuli in more than half of the cases indicated that even not perceived stimuli are centrally processed.

AB  - Abstract
Clinical and preclinical research suggest that activation of the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system is involved in mediating the rewarding actions of drugs of abuse, as well as promoting drug-seeking behavior. Inhibition of DA D1 receptors in the nucleus accumbens (Acb) can reduce ethanol (EtOH)-seeking behavior of non-selective rats triggered by environmental context. However, to date, there has been no research on the effects of D1 receptor agents on EtOH- seeking behavior of high alcohol-preferring (P) rats following prolonged abstinence. The objective of the present study was to examine the effects of microinjecting the D1 antagonist SCH 23390 or the D1 agonist A-77636 into the Acb shell or Acb core on spontaneous recovery of EtOH-seeking behavior. After 10 weeks of concurrent access to EtOH and water, P rats underwent seven extinction sessions (EtOH and water withheld), followed by 2 weeks in their home cages without access to EtOH or operant sessions. In the 2nd week of the home cage phase, rats were bilaterally implanted with guide cannula aimed at the Acb shell or Acb core; rats were allowed 7 days to recover before EtOH-seeking was assessed by the Pavlovian Spontaneous Recovery (PSR) model. Administration of SCH23390 (1 μg/side) into the Acb shell inhibited responding on the EtOH lever, whereas administration of A-77636 (0.125 μg/side) increased responding on the EtOH lever. Microinfusion of D1 receptor agents into the Acb core did not alter responding on the EtOH lever. Responses on the water lever were not altered by any of the treatments. The results suggest that activation of D1 receptors within the Acb shell, but not Acb core, are involved in mediating PSR of EtOH-seeking behavior of P rats.

AB  - Abstract
The hypocretin signaling is thought to play a critical role in maintaining wakefulness via stimulating the subcortical arousal pathways. Although the cortical areas, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), receive dense hypocretinergic fibers and express its receptors, it remains unclear whether the hypocretins can directly regulate the neural activity of the mPFC in vivo. In the present study, using multiple-channel single-unit recording study, we found that infusion of the SB-334867, a blocker for the Hcrtr1, beside the recording sites within the mPFC substantially exerted an inhibitory effect on the putative pyramidal neuron (PPN) activity in naturally behaving rats. In addition, functional blockade of the Hcrtr1 also selectively reduced the power of the gamma oscillations. The PPN activity and the power of the neural oscillations were not affected after microinjection of the TCS-OX2-29, a blocker for the Hcrtr2, within the mPFC. Together, these data indicate that endogenous hypocretins acting on the Hcrtr1 are required for the normal neural activity in the mPFC in vivo, and thus might directly contribute cortical arousal and mPFC-dependent cognitive processes.

AB  - Abstract
We investigated the role of the autonomic nervous system to cardiovascular responses to obstructive apnea in awake, unrestrained rats, and measured expression of Fos induced by apnea in the brainstem. We implanted a tracheal balloon contained in a rigid tube to allow the induction of apnea without inducing pain in the trachea. During bouts of 15 s of apnea, heart rate fell from 371 ± 8 to 161 ± 11 bpm (mean ± SEM, n = 15, p &lt; 0.01) and arterial pressure increased from 115 ± 2 to 131 ± 4 mmHg (p &lt; 0.01). Bradycardia was due to parasympathetic activity because it was blocked by the muscarinic antagonist, methylatropine. The pressor response was due to vasoconstriction caused by sympathetic activation because it was blocked by the α1 antagonist, prazosin. Apnea induced Fos expression in several brainstem areas involved in cardiorespiratory control such as the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), ventrolateral medulla (VLM), and pons. Ligation of the carotid body artery reduced apnea-induced bradycardia, blocked heart rate responses to i.v. injection of cyanide, reduced Fos expression in the caudal NTS, and increased Fos expression in the rostral VLM. In conclusion, apnea activates neurons in regions that process signals from baroreceptors, chemoreceptors, pulmonary receptors, and regions responsible for autonomic and respiratory activity both in the presence and absence of carotid chemoreceptors.

AB  - Abstract
The striatum is a major target of cerebral cortical output. The cortico-striatal projection has been well described, however, the neurochemical changes that occur in the striatum after prolonged cortical hyperactivation remain to be investigated. In this study, extracellular levels of glutamate, GABA, and alanine levels were measured in the dorsal striatum using microdialysis in anesthetized mice at resting condition and during 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-induced cortical seizures. After topical application of 4-AP on the primary motor cortex that induced cortical seizures, the extracellular level of striatal GABA increased by 40% in 60 min. By contrast, the extracellular level of striatal glutamate decreased by 20%. Moreover, the surface amounts of striatal glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST) and glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1), the major astrocytic high-affinity glutamate transporters, tended to increase by cortical seizures in 60 min, suggesting a recruitment of the glutamate transporters from internal stores. 4-AP also resulted in a steady increase of alanine levels which are thought to reflect glutamate and pyruvate metabolism in neurons and astrocytes. These observations possibly delineate adaptive changes of striatal metabolism by severe cortical seizures.

AB  - Abstract
Exposure to an altered osmotic environment during a pre/postnatal period can differentially program the fluid intake and excretion pattern profile in a way that persists until adulthood. However, knowledge about the programing effects on the underlying brain neurochemical circuits of thirst and hydroelectrolyte balance, and its relation with behavioral outputs, is limited. We evaluated whether early voluntary intake of hypertonic NaCl solution may program adult offspring fluid balance, plasma vasopressin, neural activity, and brain vasopressin and angiotensinergic receptor type 1a (AT1a)-receptor gene expression. The manipulation (M) period covered dams from 1 week before conception until offspring turned 1-month-old. The experimental groups were (i) Free access to hypertonic NaCl solution (0.45 M NaCl), food (0.18% NaCl) and water [M-Na]; and (ii) Free access to food and water only [M-Ctrol]. Male offspring (2-month-old) were subjected to iv infusion (0.15 ml/min) of hypertonic (1.5 M NaCl), isotonic (0.15 M NaCl) or sham infusion during 20 min. Cumulative water intake (140 min) and drinking latency to the first lick were recorded from the start of the infusion. Our results indicate that, after systemic sodium overload, the M-Na group had increased water intake, and diminished neuronal activity (Fos-immunoreactivity) in the subfornical organ (SFO) and nucleus of the solitary tract. They also showed reduced relative vasopressin (AVP)-mRNA and AT1a-mRNA expression at the supraoptic nucleus and SFO, respectively. The data indicate that the availability of a rich source of sodium during the pre/postnatal period induces a long-term effect on drinking, neural activity, and brain gene expression implicated in the control of hydroelectrolyte balance.

AB  - Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent and malignant primary brain tumor. Conventional therapy of surgical removal, radiation and chemotherapy is largely palliative. Major vault protein (MVP), the main component of the vault organelle has been associated with multidrug resistance by reducing cellular accumulation of chemotherapeutic agents. With regard to cancer, MVP has been shown to be overexpressed in drug resistance development and malignant progression.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the MVP gene dosage levels in 113 archival samples from GBM and its correlation with patients’ survival and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene dosages. Fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed polysomy of chromosome 7 in 76.1% of the GBMs and EGFR amplification in a 64.6% of the tumors. Genetic status of EGFR, PTEN and MVP copies was determined by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) technique. 31% of the tumors showed the EGFR is variant III mutation (EGFRvIII) mutation and 74.3% of them presented amplification of MVP gene. Amplification of EGFR and MVP was found in a 63.7% and 56.6% of the GBM, respectively. An inverse correlation between MVP and PTEN dosage values was observed. Besides, an inverse relationship between the survival of the patients treated with chemotherapy and the levels of MVP copies was determined. In conclusion, our study reveals an important role of MVP, together with EGFRvIII and PTEN, in the progression of GBM and proposes it as a novel and interesting target for new treatment approaches.

AB  - Abstract
l-Dopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) are a serious side effect of dopamine replacement therapy for Parkinson’s disease. The mechanisms that underlie LIDs are currently unclear. However, preclinical studies indicate that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play a role, suggesting that drugs targeting these receptors may be of therapeutic benefit. To further understand the involvement of α6β2∗ nAChRs in LIDs, we used gain-of-function α6∗ nAChR (α6L9S) mice that exhibit a 20-fold enhanced sensitivity to nAChR agonists. Wildtype (WT) and α6L9S mice were lesioned by unilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, 3 μg/ml) into the medial forebrain bundle. Three to 4 wk later, they were administered l-dopa (3 mg/kg) plus benserazide (15 mg/kg) until stably dyskinetic. l-dopa-induced abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) were similar in α6L9S and WT mice. WT mice were then given nicotine in the drinking water in gradually increasing doses to a final 300 μg/ml, which resulted in a 40% decline AIMs. By contrast, there was no decrease in AIMs in α6L9S mice at a maximally tolerated nicotine dose of 20 μg/ml. However, the nAChR antagonist mecamylamine (1 mg/kg ip 30 min before l-dopa) reduced l-dopa-induced AIMs in both α6L9S and WT mice. Thus, both a nAChR agonist and antagonist decreased AIMs in WT mice, but only the antagonist was effective in α6L9S mice. Since nicotine appears to reduce LIDs via desensitization, hypersensitive α6β2∗ nAChRs may desensitize less readily. The present data show that α6β2∗ nAChRs are key regulators of LIDs, and may be useful therapeutic targets for their management in Parkinson’s disease.

AB  - Abstract
A hallmark of peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP) is chronic spontaneous pain and/or hypersensitivity to normally painful stimuli (hyperalgesia) or normally nonpainful stimuli (allodynia).This pain results partly from abnormal hyperexcitability of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. We have previously shown, using a modified version of the lumbar 5 (L5)-spinal nerve ligation model of PNP (mSNA model involving L5-spinal nerve axotomy plus loose ligation of the lumbar 4 (L4)-spinal nerve with neuroinflammation-inducing chromic-gut), that L4 DRG neurons exhibit increased spontaneous activity, the key characteristic of neuronal hyperexcitability. The underlying ionic and molecular mechanisms of the hyperexcitability of L4 DRG neurons are incompletely understood, but could result from changes in expression and/or function of ion channels including hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, which are active near the neuron’s resting membrane potential, and which produce an excitatory inward current that depolarizes the membrane potential toward the threshold of action potential generation. Therefore, in the present study we used the mSNA model to investigate whether: (a) expression of HCN1–HCN3 channels is altered in L4 DRG neurons which, in the mSNA model, are essential for transmission of the evoked pain, and which contribute to chronic spontaneous pain, and (b) local (intraplantar) blockade of these HCN channels, with a specific blocker, ZD7288, attenuates chronic spontaneous pain and/or evoked pain in mSNA rats. We found 7 days after mSNA: (1) a significant increase in HCN2-immunoreactivity in small (&lt;30 μm) DRG neurons (predominantly IB4-negative neurons), and in the proportion of small neurons expressing HCN2 (putative nociceptors); (2) no significant change in HCN1- or HCN3-immunoreactivity in all cell types; and (3) attenuation, with ZD7288 (100 μM intraplantar), of chronic spontaneous pain behavior (spontaneous foot lifting) and mechanical, but not, heat hypersensitivity. The results suggest that peripheral HCN channels contribute to mechanisms of spinal nerve injury-induced PNP, and that HCN channels, possibly HCN2, represent a novel target for PNP treatment.

AB  - Abstract
Voltage-dependent sodium channels are membrane proteins essential for cell excitability. They are composed by a pore-forming α-subunit, encoded in mammals by up to nine different genes, and four different ancillary β-subunits. The expression pattern of the α subunit isoforms confers the distinctive functional and pharmacological properties to different excitable tissues. β-Subunits are important modulators of channel function and expression. Mutation C121W of the β1-subunit causes an autosomal dominant epileptic syndrome without cardiac symptoms. In neuroectoderm GH3 and cardiac H9C2 cells, the over-expression of β1 subunit augments α subunit mRNA and protein levels as well as sodium current density. Interestingly, the introduction of the epileptogenic C121W-β1 subunit produces additional changes in the α-subunit expression pattern of H9C2 cells, leaving unaltered the sodium channel isoform composition of GH3 cells. The challenge of the present work was to identify those genes that were differentially expressed in response to WT- or C121W-β1 subunit over-expression in the two rat cell lines under analysis. Hence, we analyzed the total mRNA extracted from control-untransfected and from WT- and C121W-β1-transfected GH3 and H9C2 cells by DNA-microarray. We found that, in agreement with their different embryonal origin, the over-expression of WT- and C121W-β1 subunits modifies the expression of different gene sets in GH3 and H9C2 cells. Focusing on the effects of the C121W mutation, we found that it causes the modification of 214 genes, most of them were down-regulated (202) in GH3 cells; on the contrary, it determined the up-regulation of only five genes in H9C2 cells. Interestingly, most genes modified by the C121W β1 subunit are involved in pivotal processes of the cell such as cellular communication and protein expression. Our results confirm the important role of the sodium channel β1 subunit in the control of NaCh gene expression, and highlight once more the tissue-specific effect of the C121W mutation.

AB  - Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway. In addition to deficits in voluntary movement, PD involves a disturbance of breathing regulation. However, the cause and nature of this disturbance are not well understood. Here, we investigated breathing at rest and in response to hypercapnia (7% CO2) or hypoxia (8% O2), as well as neuroanatomical changes in brainstem regions essential for breathing, in a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of PD. Bilateral injections of 6-OHDA (24 μg/μl) into the striatum decreased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH+)-neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), transcription factor phox2b-expressing neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus and neurokinin-1 receptors in the ventral respiratory column. In 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, respiratory rate was reduced at rest, leading to a reduction in minute ventilation. These animals also showed a reduction in the tachypneic response to hypercapnia, but not to hypoxia challenge. These results suggest that the degeneration of TH+ neurons in the SNpc leads to impairment of breathing at rest and in hypercapnic conditions. Our data indicate that respiratory deficits in a 6-OHDA rat model of PD are related to downregulation of neural systems involved in respiratory rhythm generation. The present study suggests a new avenue to better understand the respiratory deficits observed in chronic stages of PD.

Hemoglobin (Hb) is a major constituent of blood and a potent mediator of oxidative or nitrative stress after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Our previous study demonstrated that Hb could induce abundant peroxynitrite (ONOO−) formation in vivo, which may be involved in the blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, however, the drug intervention is absent and also the underlying mechanism. Using an experimental stroke model by injecting Hb into the caudate nucleus of male Sprague–Dawley rats, we assessed the role of ONOO− decomposition catalyst, 5,10,15,20-tetrakis (4-sulfonatophenyl) porphyrinato iron(III) [FeTPPS] in the activation of MMP-9 and Hb-induced neurovascular injuries. 3-Nitrotyrosine (3-NT, as an index of ONOO− formation) and NF-κB expression was measured by western blot (WB) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)/immunofluorescence (IF). Activity of MMP was evaluated by in situ zymography. Neurovascular injury was assessed using zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) by WB and IF, fibronectin (FN) and neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) IHC. Perihematomal cell death was determined by TUNEL assay. Behavioral outcome was measured by modified neurological severity score (mNSS) test. At the injured striata, profuse 3-NT was produced and mainly expressed in neutrophils and microglia/macrophages. 3-NT formation significantly colocalized with nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) expression. In situ zymography showed that gelatinase activity was mostly co-localized with neurons and blood vessel walls and partly with neutrophils and microglia/macrophages. Enhanced 3-NT production, NF-κB induction and MMP-9 activation were obviously reduced after FeTPPS treatment. Hb-induced injury to tight junction protein (ZO-1), basal lamina of FN-immunopositive microvasculature and neural cells was evidently ameliorated by FeTPPS. In addition, apoptotic cell numbers as well as behavioral deficits were also improved. The present study shows that the administration of the ONOO− decomposition catalyst FeTPPS protects against Hb-induced neurovascular injuries and improves neurological function, which possibly in part by suppressing MMP-9 activation.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of mental fatigue on the duration of actual and imagined goal-directed arm movements involving speed–accuracy trade-off. Ten participants performed actual and imagined point-to-point arm movements as accurately and as fast as possible, before and after a 90-min sustained cognitive task inducing mental fatigue, and before and after viewing a neutral control task (documentary movie) that did not induce mental fatigue. Target width and center-to-center target distance were varied, resulting in five different indexes of difficulty. Prior to mental fatigue, actual and imagined movement duration increased with the difficulty of the task, as predicted by Fitts’ law. Mental fatigue task induced a 4.1 ± 0.7% increase in actual movement duration and a 9.6 ± 1.1% increase in imagined movement duration, independently of the index of difficulty. The trial-by-trial evolution of actual and imagined movement duration remained stable with mental fatigue. The control task did not induce any change in actual and imagined movement duration. The results suggested that movement was slowed in the presence of mental fatigue, maybe due to proactive changes occurring during the preparatory state of the movement, to preserve task success.

AB  - Abstract
Previous results have shown that the substance P (SP) N-terminal fragment SP1–7 may attenuate hyperalgesia and produce anti-allodynia in animals using various experimental models for neuropathic pain. The heptapeptide was found to induce its effects through binding to and activating specific sites apart from any known neurokinin or opioid receptor. Furthermore, we have applied a medicinal chemistry program to develop lead compounds mimicking the effect of SP1–7. The present study was designed to evaluate the pharmacological effect of these compounds using the mouse spared nerve injury (SNI) model of chronic neuropathic pain. Also, as no comprehensive screen with the aim to identify the SP1–7 target has yet been performed we screened our lead compound H-Phe-Phe-NH2 toward a panel of drug targets. The extensive target screen, including 111 targets, did not reveal any hit for the binding site among a number of known receptors or enzymes involved in pain modulation. Our animal studies confirmed that SP1–7, but also synthetic analogs thereof, possesses anti-allodynic effects in the mouse SNI model of neuropathic pain. One of the lead compounds, a constrained H-Phe-Phe-NH2 analog, was shown to exhibit a significant anti-allodynic effect.

AB  - Abstract
Neurofilaments (NF) are released into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during multiple sclerosis (MS), but their role outside the axon is still unknown. In vitro NF fractions, as well as tubulin (TUB), increase oligodendrocyte (OL) progenitor proliferation and/or their differentiation depending on the stage of their purification (Fressinaud et al., 2012). However the mechanism by which NF enter these cells, as well as that of synthetic peptides displaying NFL-tubulin-binding site (NFL-TBS.40–63) (Fressinaud and Eyer, 2014), remains elusive. Using rat OL secondary cultures we localized NF, TUB, and NFL-TBS.40–63 by double immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. After treating OL cultures with NF P2 (2nd pellet of the purification), or TRITC-TUB, these proteins were localized in the cytoplasmic processes of myelin basic protein (MBP+) expressing OL. Similarly biotinylated NFL-TBS.40–63 synthetic peptides and KER-TBS.1–24 were detected in OL progenitors, differentiated (CNP+) and MBP+ OL. In addition, NFL-TBS.40–63 colocalized with cholera toxin, a known marker of endocytosis, within the cells. Pretreatment of OL by methyl β cyclodextrin abolishes both cholera toxin and NFL-TBS.40–63 uptake, indicating endocytosis. Clathrin-dependent endocytosis was further confirmed by treatment with dynasore, a dynamin inhibitor, which inhibited the uptake of peptides, as well as NFP2 fractions, by 50%. This study demonstrates that axon cytoskeletal proteins and peptides can be internalized by OL through endocytosis. This process could be involved during demyelination, and the release of axon proteins might promote remyelination.

AB  - Abstract
Fibronectin type III domain containing 5 (Fndc5) has already been distinguished to be involved in neural differentiation. However, cellular events of Fndc5 function are still ambiguous in the nervous system. One approach to shed light on duty of this protein in the nervous system is to find its cross-talks with various signaling pathways with defined characteristics and roles. Identification of the underlying molecular mechanism which controls Fndc5 expression and switches its activity up and down enables us to find out the Fndc5 functional map in the nervous system and other human body systems. Retinoic acid (RA) is a bio-small molecule which exerts its role as a neural inducer in the neurodevelopmental process of neural tube. RA up-regulates the expression of various genes involved in neural differentiation process via two distinct pathways: the genomic and the non-genomic. Our previous study has revealed that RA induces Fndc5 expression during neural differentiation process. In this study we have evaluated our hypothesis about the non-genomic up regulation of Fndc5 expression by RA. Interestingly we have identified that there is an association between ERK signaling pathway and Fndc5 expression. Furthermore, inhibition of this pathway by PD0325901 dramatically reduced Fndc5 mRNA level, while activating the pathway up-regulated Fndc5 transcription. In addition, it has been proven that ERK1/2 modulation via RA has more significant controlling effect on Fndc5 promoter rather than bFGF. This led us to conclude that RA enhances Fndc5 expression through a non-genomic pathway via the ERK signaling pathway.

AB  - Abstract
Neural function within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) regulates normal cognition, attention and impulse control, implicating neuroregulatory abnormalities within this region in mental dysfunction related to schizophrenia, depression and drug abuse. Both serotonin-2A (5-HT2A) and -2C (5-HT2C) receptors are known to be important in neuropsychiatric drug action and are distributed throughout the mPFC. However, their interactive role in serotonergic cortical regulation is poorly understood. While the main signal transduction mechanism for both receptors is stimulation of phosphoinositide production, they can have opposite effects downstream. 5-HT2A versus 5-HT2C receptor activation oppositely regulates behavior and can oppositely affect neurochemical release within the mPFC. These distinct receptor effects could be caused by their differential cellular distribution within the cortex and/or other areas. It is known that both receptors are located on GABAergic and pyramidal cells within the mPFC, but it is not clear whether they are expressed on the same or different cells. The present work employed immunofluorescence with confocal microscopy to examine this in layers V–VI of the prelimbic mPFC. The majority of GABA cells in the deep prelimbic mPFC expressed 5-HT2C receptor immunoreactivity. Furthermore, most cells expressing 5-HT2C receptor immunoreactivity notably co-expressed 5-HT2A receptors. However, 27% of 5-HT2C receptor immunoreactive cells were not GABAergic, indicating that a population of prelimbic pyramidal projection cells could express the 5-HT2C receptor. Indeed, some cells with 5-HT2C and 5-HT2A receptor co-labeling had a pyramidal shape and were expressed in the typical layered fashion of pyramidal cells. This indirectly demonstrates that 5-HT2C and 5-HT2A receptors may be commonly co-expressed on GABAergic cells within the deep layers of the prelimbic mPFC and perhaps co-localized on a small population of local pyramidal projection cells. Thus a complex interplay of cortical 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor mechanisms exists, which if altered, could modulate efferent brain systems implicated in mental illness.

AB  - Abstract
During the execution of the skilled reaching task, naïve rats bring their elbow to the midline of their body to aim at the food target, perform the arpeggio movement to grasp it and supinate the paw to bring the food to their mouth. Red nucleus lesions in the rat interfere with each of these three movement elements of reaching. On the other hand, lesions to the rubrospinal tract, which originate from the magnocellular subdivision of the red nucleus, only interfere with the arpeggio movement. This latter evidence strongly suggests that impairment in aiming and supinating could be under the control of the parvocellular subdivision of the red nucleus. In order to test this hypothesis, rats were trained on the skilled reaching task and then received either complete lesions of the red nucleus or lesions restricted to its parvo- or magnocellular subdivision. In line with previous data, complete excitotoxic lesions of the red nucleus compromised limb aiming, arpeggio and supination. Lesions restricted to the parvocellular division of the red nucleus abolish supination and interfere with aiming, although the latter result did not reach significance. The results are discussed in terms of the distinct connectivity and functional significance of these two architectonic subdivisions of the red nucleus.

AB  - Abstract
We investigated phonological processing in normal readers to answer the question to what extent phonological recoding is active during silent reading and if or how it guides lexico-semantic access. We addressed this issue by looking at pseudohomophone and baseword frequency effects in lexical decisions with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results revealed greater activation in response to pseudohomophones than for well-controlled pseudowords in the left inferior/superior frontal and middle temporal cortex, left insula, and left superior parietal lobule. Furthermore, we observed a baseword frequency effect for pseudohomophones (e.g., FEAL) but not for pseudowords (e.g., FEEP). This baseword frequency effect was qualified by activation differences in bilateral angular and left supramarginal, and bilateral middle temporal gyri for pseudohomophones with low- compared to high-frequency basewords. We propose that lexical decisions to pseudohomophones involves phonology-driven lexico-semantic activation of their basewords and that this is converging neuroimaging evidence for automatically activated phonological representations during silent reading in experienced readers.

AB  - Abstract
Sphingomyelin derivatives like sphingosine have been shown to enhance secretion in a variety of systems, including neuroendocrine and neuronal cells. By studying the mechanisms underlying this effect, we demonstrate here that sphingomyelin rafts co-localize strongly with synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 Kda (SNAP-25) clusters in cultured bovine chromaffin cells and that they appear to be linked in a dynamic manner. In functional terms, when cultured rat chromaffin cells are treated with sphingomyelinase (SMase), producing sphingomyelin derivatives, the secretion elicited by repetitive depolarizations is enhanced. This increase was independent of cell size and it was significant 15 min after initiating stimulation. Interestingly, by evaluating the membrane capacitance we found that the events in control untreated cells corresponded to two populations of microvesicles and granules, and the fusion of both these populations is clearly enhanced after treatment with SMase. Furthermore, SMase does not increase the size of chromaffin granules. Together, these results strongly suggest that SNARE-mediated exocytosis is enhanced by the generation of SMase derivatives, reflecting an increase in the frequency of fusion of both microvesicles and chromaffin granules rather than an increase in the size of these vesicles.

AB  - Abstract
Water accumulation in retinal glial (Müller) and neuronal cells resulting in cellular swelling contributes to the development of retinal edema and neurodegeneration. Intravitreal administration of neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is known to promote survival of retinal neurons. Here, we show that exogenous BDNF inhibits the osmotic swelling of Müller cell somata induced by superfusion of rat retinal slices or freshly isolated cells with a hypoosmotic solution containing barium ions. BDNF also inhibited the osmotic swelling of bipolar cell somata in retinal slices, but failed to inhibit the osmotic soma swelling of freshly isolated bipolar cells. The inhibitory effect of BDNF on Müller cell swelling was mediated by activation of tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) and transactivation of fibroblast growth factor receptors. Exogenous basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) fully inhibited the osmotic swelling of Müller cell somata while it partially inhibited the osmotic swelling of bipolar cell somata. Isolated Müller cells displayed immunoreactivity of truncated TrkB, but not full-length TrkB. Isolated rod bipolar cells displayed immunoreactivities of both TrkB isoforms. Data suggest that the neuroprotective effect of exogenous BDNF in the retina is in part mediated by prevention of the cytotoxic swelling of retinal glial and bipolar cells. While BDNF directly acts on Müller cells by activation of TrkB, BDNF indirectly acts on bipolar cells by inducing glial release of factors like bFGF that inhibit bipolar cell swelling.

AB  - Abstract
The neural substrate of sleep homeostasis is unclear, but both cortical and subcortical structures are thought to be involved in sleep regulation. To test whether prior neuronal activity in the cortex or in subcortical regions drives sleep rebound, we systemically administered atropine (100 mg/kg) to rats, producing a dissociated state with slow-wave cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) but waking behavior (e.g. locomotion). Atropine injections during the light period produced 6 h of slow-wave cortical EEG but also subcortical arousal. Afterward, rats showed a significant increase in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, compared to the same period on a baseline day. Consistent with the behavioral and cortical EEG state produced by systemic atropine, c-Fos expression was low in the cortex but high in multiple subcortical arousal systems. These data suggest that subcortical arousal and behavior are sufficient to drive sleep homeostasis, while a sleep-like pattern of cortical activity is not sufficient to satisfy sleep homeostasis.

AB  - Abstract
Following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) may promote vascular remodeling. Whether HMGB1 supports angiogenesis after ICH is unclear, as are the receptors and downstream signaling pathway(s) involved. We used the rat model of collagenase-induced ICH to determine whether HMGB1 acts via the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) to upregulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent mitogen of endothelial cells and key regulator of normal and abnormal angiogenesis in the late phase of injury. At 3 d after ICH induction, rats were treated with saline, ethyl pyruvate (EP) or N-benzyl-4-chloro-N-cyclohexylbenzamide (FPS-ZM1). ICH induced the movement of HMGB1 from the nucleus into the cytoplasm. Levels of HMGB1 and RAGE in the ipsilateral striatum increased within a few days of induction and continued to rise for 7–14 d afterward. By 14 d after induction, levels of VEGF and vessel density were higher than in the Sham group. Administering EP 3 days after ICH induction prevented much of the stroke-induced increases in vessel density and in expression of HMGB1, RAGE, and VEGF. Administering FPS-ZM1 after ICH blocked much of the stroke-induced increases in vessel density and VEGF expression. Our results suggest that after ICH, HMGB1 may upregulate VEGF in the ipsilateral striatum predominantly via RAGE. Hence, targeting the HMGB1/RAGE signaling pathway may help reduce inappropriate angiogenesis after ICH.

AB  - Abstract
Recent studies have demonstrated that inflammatory and immune mechanisms play important roles in the progression of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-induced white matter lesions (WMLs). As an endogenous neuromodulator in the brain, the extracellular levels of adenosine represent a critical endogenous mechanism for the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. Ecto-5′-nucleotidase (CD73), which dephosphorylates AMP to adenosine, is considered to catalyze the rate-limiting step in the generation of extracellular adenosine. However, the role of CD73 in the development of CCH-induced WMLs remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the expression and activity of CD73 using immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis and measurements of the rate of AMP hydrolysis in a mouse model of CCH via bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) surgery. Moreover, C57BL/6-CD73 knockout (KO) and their wild-type littermates were subjected to BCAS surgery to further investigate the functional roles of CD73 in the WMLs. White matter (WM) changes, astrocyte and microglia proliferation, proinflammatory cytokine levels in the corpus callosum and cognitive function were assessed on the 30th day after BCAS. The results indicated that CD73 expression and activities significantly increased in the corpus callosum on the 30th day after BCAS. Moreover, CD73 deficiency exacerbated CCH-induced WMLs and cognitive impairment. More reactive astrocytes and microglia were observed in the corpus callosum in CD73-KO mice. CD73 deficiency significantly increased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in the BCAS model of CCH. These findings suggest that CD73 plays a protective role in the development of CCH-induced WMLs and cognitive impairment via the regulation of glial cell activation and proinflammatory cytokine expression.

AB  - Abstract
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder for which there is currently no effective treatment. Studies indicate that enhancing autophagy in mouse models of neurodegenerative disease can ameliorate the behavioral symptoms and pathological damage associated with the accumulation of pathological mutant proteins such as mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD1). This study investigated the effects of trehalose treatment on both early and end-stage disease in a transgenic mouse model of ALS via short-term (30 days after administration) and long-term (from 60 days after administration to death) trehalose treatment experiments. Sixty-day-old female SOD1-G93A transgenic mice were treated daily with 2% (w/v) trehalose in their drinking water for 30 days and monitored until they reached a neurological score of four, whereupon they were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Neurological, rotarod performance test and hanging wire test scores were recorded and body weight monitored. After death, the spinal cord was removed to assess the number of motor neurons and to measure the expression of mutant SOD1, LC3-II and p62. Trehalose significantly reduced the levels of mutant SOD1 and p62 and increased LC3-II in the spinal cords of 90-day-old SOD1-G93A transgenic mice. Furthermore, trehalose treatment significantly postponed disease onset, lengthened the time it took to reach a neurological score of 2 and preserved motor function; however, trehalose became less effective at delaying further disease progression as the disease progressed beyond a neurological score of 2 and it failed to extend the survival of SOD1-G93A transgenic mice. Additionally, independent of autophagy, trehalose consistently inhibited microgliosis and astrogliosis throughout the entire duration of the study. In conclusion, trehalose may be a useful add-on therapy in conjunction with other ALS treatment options to alleviate symptoms in early-stage ALS.

AB  - Abstract
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a complex neurobehavioral disorder that is characterized by attention difficulties, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. A non-stimulant drug, atomoxetine (ATX), which is a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, is widely used for ADHD because it exhibits fewer adverse effects compared to conventional psychostimulants. However, little is known about the therapeutic mechanisms of ATX. ATX treatment significantly alleviated hyperactivity of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP)-deficient (PACAP−/−) mice with C57BL/6J and 129S6/SvEvTac hybrid background. ATX also improved impaired novel object recognition memory and prepulse inhibition in PACAP−/− mice with CD1 background. The ATX-induced increases in extracellular noradrenaline and dopamine levels were significantly higher in the prefrontal cortex of PACAP−/− mice compared to wild-type mice with C57BL/6J and 129S6/SvEvTac hybrid background. These results suggest that ATX treatment-induced increases in central monoamine metabolism may be involved in the rescue of ADHD-related abnormalities in PACAP−/− mice. Our current study suggests that PACAP−/− mice are an ideal rodent model with predictive validity for the study of ADHD etiology and drug development. Additionally, the potential effects of differences in genetic background of PACAP−/− mice on behaviors are discussed.

AB  - Abstract
Complex amplitude dynamics of dominant alpha oscillations (8–13 Hz) in the cortex can be captured with long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) in healthy subjects and in various diseases. In patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD), intra-nuclear coherence was demonstrated in dominant beta rhythms (10–30 Hz) in the basal ganglia. However, so far the relation between cortical LRTC (across tens of seconds) and subcortical coherence (millisecond scale) is unknown. We addressed these “multiscale interactions” by simultaneous recordings of surface electroencephalography (EEG) and deep local field potentials (LFP) from the bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) in eight patients with severe PD eligible for deep brain stimulation, who performed a lexical decision task on medication. In the continuous data set LRTC up to 20 s were calculated in the amplitude envelope of 8–13-Hz EEG oscillations (across whole scalp), and subcortical coherence was assessed with measures being insensitive to volume conduction artifacts (imaginary part of coherency; iCOH) in 10–20 and 21–30-Hz oscillations in STN–LFP. We showed a significant positive correlation across patients between cortical LRTC (8–13 Hz) and subcortical iCOH selectively in 10–20-Hz oscillations in the left STN. Our results suggest a relation between neural dynamics in the most dominant rhythms in the cortex and basal ganglia in PD, extending across multiple time scales (milliseconds vs. tens of seconds). Furthermore, the investigation of multiscale interactions might contribute to our understanding of cortical–subcortical neural coupling in PD.

AB  - Abstract
The present work was designed to investigate the presynaptic modulation of soleus Ia afferents with the position and the direction of the displacement of the center of pressure (CoP) during unperturbed upright standing and exaggerated CoP displacements in young adults. Hoffmann (H) reflex was evoked in the soleus by stimulating the tibial nerve at the knee level. Modulation of Ia presynaptic inhibition was assessed by conditioning the H reflex with fibular nerve (D1 inhibition) and femoral nerve (heteronymous facilitation) stimulation. Leg muscle activity was assessed by electromyography (EMG). The results indicate that in unperturbed standing and exaggerated CoP displacements, the H-reflex amplitude was greater during forward than backward CoP direction (p &lt; 0.05). However, the amplitude of the conditioned H reflex (expressed relative to unconditioned H reflex) did not vary with CoP displacement, regardless of the experimental condition. The soleus EMG was greater during forward than backward CoP direction and during anterior than posterior position in both experimental conditions (p &lt; 0.05). The modulation of the unconditioned H reflex with CoP direction was positively associated with the corresponding changes in soleus EMG (r2 &gt; 0.34). The tibialis anterior EMG did not change during unperturbed standing, but was greater for backward than forward CoP direction during exaggerated CoP displacements. In this experimental condition, soleus EMG was negatively associated with tibialis anterior EMG (r2 = 0.81). These results indicate that Ia presynaptic inhibition is not modulated with CoP direction and position, but rather suggest that CoP displacements induced changes in excitability of the soleus motor neuron pool.

AB  - Abstract
Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCN) are selectively vulnerable to damage and loss in a number of neurodegenerative disorders that afflict the elderly, particularly Alzheimer’s disease. The reasons for this selective vulnerability remain poorly understood. Given that intraneuronal accumulation of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) has been shown to exert deleterious effects on neurons, we tested potential accumulation of Aβ within BFCN in rhesus monkeys, which like the human display age-related accumulation of this peptide in plaques. The non-isoform-specific Aβ antibodies 1282 and 6E10 and the specific antibodies to 1–40 amino acid isoform of Aβ (Aβ1–40) and 1–42 amino acid isoform of Aβ (Aβ1–42) species were used in immunohistochemical experiments of basal forebrain in young and aged rhesus monkeys. All four antibodies visualized cortical plaques in the same sections in which BFCN were examined, in aged but not in young animals. The basal forebrain region within which the BFCN are localized was virtually free of plaques. Appreciable Aβ immunoreactivity was present within the nucleus basalis of Meynert–cholinergic cell group 4 (nbM–Ch4), the major component of BFCN, with all antibodies used. Quantitation of optical density indicated significant age-related increases in immunoreactivity in nbM–Ch4 neurons with the Aβ1–40 (p &lt; 0.002) and 1282 (p &lt; 0.03) antibodies. Immunoreactivity for 6E10 displayed a small, non-significant age-related increase in nbM–Ch4 neurons (p &gt; 0.05). No age-related changes were detected in Aβ1–42 immunoreactivity in these neurons. Unlike the BFCN, cortical neurons within the same sections were virtually devoid of Aβ immunoreactivity, particularly with isoform-specific antibodies. Both smooth and granular intraneuronal Aβ immunoreactivity, reminiscent of endosomal/lysosomal packaged peptide, were observed within nbM–Ch4 neurons. In some nbM–Ch4 neurons, 1282 immunoreactivity had the appearance of large peptide aggregates. Significant accumulation and age-related increase of Aβ in BFCN is likely to interfere with the normal functioning of these neurons. It remains to be determined if similar accumulation of Aβ occurs in human BFCN.

AB  - Abstract
Aging is accompanied by a complicated pattern of changes in the brain organization and often by alterations in specific memory functions. One of the brain activities with important role in the process of memory consolidation is thought to be the hippocampus activity of sharp waves and ripple oscillation (SWRs). Using field recordings from the CA1 area of hippocampal slices we compared SWRs as well as single pyramidal cell activity between adult (3–6-month old) and old (24–34-month old) Wistar rats. The slices from old rats displayed ripple oscillation with a significantly less number of ripples and lower frequency compared with those from adult animals. However, the hippocampus from old rats had significantly higher propensity to organized SWRs in long sequences. Furthermore, the bursts recorded from complex spike cells in slices from old compared with adult rats displayed higher number of spikes and longer mean inter-spike interval. Blockade of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors by 3-((R)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) increased the amplitude of both sharp waves and ripples and increased the interval between events of SWRs in both age groups. On the contrary, CPP reduced the probability of occurrence of sequences of SWRs more strongly in slices from adult than old rats. Blockade of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels by nifedipine only enhanced the amplitude of sharp waves in slices from adult rats. CPP increased the postsynaptic excitability and the paired-pulse inhibition in slices from both adult and old rats similarly while nifedipine increased the postsynaptic excitability only in slices from adult rats. We propose that the tendency of the aged hippocampus to generate long sequences of SWR events might represent the consequence of homeostatic mechanisms that adaptively try to compensate the impairment in the ripple oscillation in order to maintain the behavioral outcome efficient in the old individuals. The age-dependent alterations in the firing mode of pyramidal cells might underlie to some extent the changes in ripples that occur in old animals.

AB  - Abstract
The role of the cerebral cortex in maintaining human standing balance remains unclear. Beta corticomuscular coherence (CMC) provides a measure of communication between the sensory-motor cortex and muscle, but past literature has not demonstrated significant beta CMC during human stance. This study evaluated the effects of stance width, vision, and surface compliance on beta CMC during human stance using methods to enhance sensitivity to CMC. Ten healthy, young adults stood for three 60-s trials in each of a wide or narrow stance width while on a firm surface and in narrow stance on a foam surface, each with eyes open or closed. Beta CMC was calculated between contralateral electroencephalographic and electromyographic recordings. Electromyography was recorded from bilateral tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius lateralis muscles. CMC magnitude was defined as the average integrated area of coherence spectrum above a significance threshold. Measures of center-of-pressure (COP) sway were derived from force plates under the subjects’ feet. Results of CMC from four muscles across six stance conditions (a total of 24 combinations) demonstrated significant average CMC magnitude from every subject in 20 combinations and significant average CMC magnitude in nine of 10 subjects in the remaining four combinations. The CMC magnitude was significantly larger in the wide-stance condition than in the narrow-stance condition with eyes open. No significant differences were detected when comparing eyes-open to eyes-closed conditions or when comparing firm- to foam-surface conditions. Correlations between CMC magnitude and COP sway elicited some significant relationships, but there was no consistent direction or pattern of correlation based on muscle or stance condition. Results demonstrate that significant beta CMC is evident during human standing balance, and that beta CMC is responsive to changes in mechanical, but not visual or surface, conditions.

AB  - Abstract
Auditory thalamus (medial geniculate body [MGB]) receives ascending inhibitory GABAergic inputs from inferior colliculus (IC) and descending GABAergic projections from the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) with both inputs postulated to play a role in shaping temporal responses. Previous studies suggested that enhanced processing of temporally rich stimuli occurs at the level of MGB, with our recent study demonstrating enhanced GABA sensitivity in MGB compared to IC. The present study used sinusoidal amplitude-modulated (SAM) stimuli to generate modulation transfer functions (MTFs), to examine the role of GABAergic inhibition in shaping the response properties of MGB single units in anesthetized rats. Rate MTFs (rMTFs) were parsed into “bandpass (BP)”, “mixed (Mixed)”, “highpass (HP)” or “atypical” response types, with most units showing the Mixed response type. GABAA receptor blockade with iontophoretic application of the GABAA receptor (GABAAR) antagonist gabazine (GBZ) selectively altered the response properties of most MGB neurons examined. Mixed and HP units showed significant GABAAR-mediated SAM-evoked rate response changes at higher modulation frequencies (fms), which were also altered by N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor blockade (2R)-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (AP5). BP units, and the lower arm of Mixed units responded to GABAAR blockade with increased responses to SAM stimuli at or near the rate best modulation frequency (rBMF). The ability of GABA circuits to shape responses at higher modulation frequencies is an emergent property of MGB units, not observed at lower levels of the auditory pathway and may reflect activation of MGB NMDA receptors (Rabang and Bartlett, 2011; Rabang et al., 2012). Together, GABAARs exert selective rate control over selected fms, generally without changing the units’ response type. These results showed that coding of modulated stimuli at the level of auditory thalamus is at least, in part, strongly controlled by GABA neurotransmission, in delicate balance with glutamatergic neurotransmission.

AB  - Abstract
Weight-loss dieting often leads to loss of control, rebound weight gain, and is a risk factor for binge pathology. Based on findings that food restriction (FR) upregulates sucrose-induced trafficking of glutamatergic AMPA receptors to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) postsynaptic density (PSD), this study was an initial test of the hypothesis that episodic “breakthrough” intake of forbidden food during dieting interacts with upregulated mechanisms of synaptic plasticity to increase reward-driven feeding. Ad libitum (AL) fed and FR subjects consumed a limited amount of 10% sucrose, or had access to water, every other day for 10 occasions. Beginning three weeks after return of FR rats to AL feeding, when 24-h chow intake and rate of body weight gain had normalized, subjects with a history of sucrose intake during FR consumed more sucrose during a four week intermittent access protocol than the two AL groups and the group that had access to water during FR. In an experiment that substituted noncontingent administration of d-amphetamine for sucrose, FR subjects displayed an enhanced locomotor response during active FR but a blunted response, relative to AL subjects, during recovery from FR. This result suggests that the enduring increase in sucrose consumption is unlikely to be explained by residual enhancing effects of FR on dopamine signaling. In a biochemical experiment which paralleled the sucrose behavioral experiment, rats with a history of sucrose intake during FR displayed increased abundance of pSer845-GluA1, GluA2, and GluA3 in the NAc PSD relative to rats with a history of FR without sucrose access and rats that had been AL throughout, whether they had a history of episodic sucrose intake or not. A history of FR, with or without a history of sucrose intake, was associated with increased abundance of GluA1. A terminal 15-min bout of sucrose intake produced a further increase in pSer845-GluA1 and GluA2 in subjects with a history of sucrose intake during FR. Generally, neither a history of sucrose intake nor a terminal bout of sucrose intake affected AMPA receptor abundance in the NAc PSD of AL subjects. Together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis, but the functional contribution of increased synaptic incorporation of AMPA receptors remains to be established.

AB  - Abstract
Our aim was to analyze the participation of inhibitory and stimulatory signals in the temporal dissociation between sodium depletion (SD) induced by peritoneal dialysis (PD) and the appearance of sodium appetite (SA), particularly 2 h after PD, when the rats are hypovolemic/natremic but SA is not evident. We investigated the effects of bilateral injections of the serotonin (5-HT) receptor antagonist, methysergide, into the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) on hypertonic NaCl and water intake 2 h vs. 24 h after PD. We also studied plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone (ALDO) concentration 2 h vs. 24 h after PD. Additionally, we combined the analysis of brain Fos immunoreactivity (Fos-ir) with the detection of double immunoreactivity in 5HT and oxytocinergic (OT) cells 2 h after PD. Bilateral LPBN injections of methysergide (4 μg/200 nl at each site) increased NaCl intake when tested 2 h after PD compared to controls. We found a significant increase in PRA and ALDO concentration after PD but no differences between 2 and 24 h after PD. We also found for the first time a significant increase 2 h after PD in the number of Fos-ir neurons in the brainstem nuclei that have been shown to be involved in the inhibition of SA.

In summary, the results show that 5HT-mechanisms in the LPBN modulate sodium intake during the delay of SA when the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) is increased. In addition, the activation of brainstem areas previously associated with the satiety phase of SA is in part responsible for the temporal dissociation between SD and behavioral arousal.

AB  - Abstract
Icariin (ICA), a flavonoid extracted from the traditional Chinese herb Herba Epimedii that can freely cross the blood–brain barrier, inhibits neuroinflammation and attenuates oxidative stress damage. Our previous studies demonstrated that icariin exerts an antidepressant-like activity in a social defeat mouse model. However, it is unknown whether icariin is beneficial for the treatment of depression via its modulation of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of icariin on the depression-like behaviors in an unpredictable chronic mild stress (CMS) model of depression in rats. Rats exposed to CMS showed behavioral deficits in physical state, the sucrose preference test (SPT) and the forced swimming test (FST) and exhibited a significant increase in oxidative–nitrosative stress markers, inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway and increased inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression in the hippocampus, which was reversed by chronic treatment with icariin (20 or 40 mg/kg). Interestingly, icariin negatively regulated the activation of the nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome/caspase-1/IL-1β axis in the hippocampus of CMS rats. These results confirm that icariin exerts antidepressant-like effects, which may be mediated, at least in part, by enhanced antioxidant status and anti-inflammatory effects on the brain tissue via the inhibition of NF-κB signaling activation and the NLRP3-inflammasome/caspase-1/IL-1β axis. Our findings provide new information to understand the antidepressant action of icariin, which is targeted to the NLRP3-inflammasom in brain.

AB  - Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in aging people, is found to have a critical link with the deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) in the brain. The inhibition of β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), a key enzyme for Aβ production, is a promising target for AD therapy. In pursuit to find a potent inhibitor of BACE1, we identified galangin, a natural flavonoid, had a significant lowering effect on Aβ levels. Furthermore, a dramatic reduction of BACE1 at mRNA and protein levels was observed after galangin treatment. We further investigated whether epigenetic mechanisms, such as histone acetylation and DNA methylation, were involved in galangin-induced transcriptional regulation of BACE1. Our data show that galangin induces a decrease of acetylated H3 in the BACE1 promoter regions through the up-regulation of endogenous HDAC1-mediated deacetylation, which is independent of DNA methylation status. The above findings suggest a novel mechanism for polyphenols’ neuroprotective effect in neurodegeneration and galangin as a potential drug candidate for AD therapy.

AB  - Abstract
Trigeminal ganglia (TG) contain neuronal cell bodies surrounded by satellite glial cells. Although peripheral injury is well known to induce changes in gene expression within sensory ganglia, detailed mechanisms whereby peripheral injury leads to gene expression within sensory ganglia are not completely understood. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are an important modulator of hyperalgesia, but the role of ROS generated within sensory ganglia is unclear. Since ROS are known to affect transcription processes, ROS generated within sensory ganglia could directly influence gene expression and induce cellular changes at the soma level. In this study, we hypothesized that peripheral inflammation leads to cytokine and chemokine production and ROS generation within TG and that transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM2), a well known oxidative sensor, contributes to ROS-induced gene regulation within TG. The masseter injection of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) resulted in a significantly elevated level of ROS within TG of the inflamed side with a concurrent increase in cytokine expression in TG. Treatment of TG cultures with H2O2 significantly up-regulated mRNA and protein levels of cytokine/chemokine such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2 (CXCL2). TRPM2 was expressed in both neurons and non-neuronal cells in TG, and pretreatment of TG cultures with 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), an inhibitor of TRPM2, or siRNA against TRPM2 attenuated H2O2-induced up-regulation of IL-6 and CXCL2. These results suggested that activation of TRPM2 could play an important role in the modulation of cytokine/chemokine expression within TG under oxidative stress and that such changes may contribute to amplification of nociceptive signals leading to pathological pain conditions.

Statins are a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs and have been suggested therapeutic use for neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Our recent studies revealed a neuronal protective effect of lovastatin (LOV) from N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) excitotoxicity. The neuroprotective mechanism of statins, however, is far unknown. Here we demonstrated that LOV suppressed the aberrant tau phosphorylation both from frontotemporal dementia and Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) mutation and okadaic acid (OA) induction in cultured rat primary neurons. The protective effect of LOV occurred at multiple pathological sites of tau protein, including Tyr181, Tyr231 Ser202/Tyr205, Tyr212/Ser214 and Ser396/Ser404. Further analysis revealed that the potential mechanism of the suppressive effect of LOV resulted from two aspects, activating OA-inhibited protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity and attenuating OA-induced activity of tau kinases CDK5/P25 and CDK2/4, but not glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). These findings give new insights into the molecular mechanism of LOV-mediated neuroprotective effect and provide experimental evidence for its therapeutic use in AD.

AB  - Abstract
Exercise reduces the risk of developing a number of neurological disorders and increases the efficiency of cellular energy production. However, overly strenuous exercise produces oxidative stress. Proper oxygenation is crucial for the health of all tissues, and tight regulation of cellular oxygen is critical to balance O2 levels and redox homeostasis in the brain. Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF)1α and HIF2α are transcription factors regulated by cellular oxygen concentration that initiate gene regulation of vascular development, redox homeostasis, and cell cycle control. HIF1α and HIF2α contribute to important adaptive mechanisms that occur when oxygen and ROS homeostasis become unbalanced. It has been shown that preconditioning by exposure to a stressor prior to a hypoxic event reduces damage that would otherwise occur. Previously we reported that 3 months of exercise protects SNpc dopaminergic (DA) neurons from toxicity caused by Complex I inhibition. Here, we identify the cells in the SNpc that express HIF1α and HIF2α and show that running exercise produces hypoxia in SNpc DA neurons, and alters the expression of HIF1α and HIF2α. In mice carrying a conditional knockout of Hif1α in postnatal neurons we observe that exercise alone produces SNpc TH+ DA neuron loss. Loss of HIF1α also abolishes exercise-induced neuroprotection. In mice lacking Hif2α in postnatal neurons, the number of TH+ DA neurons in the adult SNpc is diminished, but 3 months of exercise rescues this loss. We conclude that HIF1α is necessary for exercise-induced neuroprotection and both HIF1α and HIF2α are necessary for the survival and function of adult SNpc DA neurons.

AB  - Abstract
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is thought to result from a combination of genetics and environmental factors. Several lines of evidence indicate that significant prevalence of anxiety and depression-related disorders in MS patients can influence the progression of the disease. Although we and others have already reported the consequences of prenatal maternal immune activation on anxiety and depression, less is known about the interplay between maternal inflammation, MS and gender. We here investigated the effects of maternal immune activation with Poly I:C during mid-gestation on the progression of clinical symptoms of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE; a mouse model of MS), and then anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors in non-EAE and EAE-induced offspring were evaluated. Stress-induced corticosterone and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels in EAE-induced offspring were also measured. Maternal immune activation increased anxiety and depression in male offspring, but not in females. This immune challenge also resulted in an earlier onset of the EAE clinical signs in male offspring and enhanced the severity of the disease in both male and female offspring. Interestingly, the severity of the disease was associated with increased anxiety/depressive-like behaviors and elevated corticosterone or TNF-α levels in both sexes. Overall, these data suggest that maternal immune activation with Poly I:C during mid-pregnancy increases anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, and the clinical symptoms of EAE in a sex-dependent manner in non-EAE or EAE-induced offspring. Finally, the progression of EAE in offspring seems to be linked to maternal immune activation-induced dysregulation in neuro-immune–endocrine system.

AB  - Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Epidemiological evidence has suggested a link between type 2 diabetes and PD, although the mechanisms remain largely unknown. We applied LC–MS/MS-based pattern analysis to investigate altered proteomes in the SN of db/db mice (db-SN) and high-fat diet mice (HFD-SN), revealing that the level of mitochondrial proteins has changed in the SN of diabetic mice compared to that of control mice. Since mitochondrial proteins were robustly altered in db-SN and HFD-SN, we performed immunoblot analysis to monitor the level of parkin, PINK1 (phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced putative kinase 1) and DJ-1 that were directly involved in mitochondrial dynamics. As a result, PINK1 and DJ-1 level was unchanged, whereas a significant loss of parkin was found in db-SN and HFD-SN, leading to the accumulation of parkin-interacting substrate (PARIS) and the reduction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α). Interestingly, these alterations were reversed by the administration of metformin, one of most frequently prescribed anti-hyperglycemic agents. The slight loss of dopaminergic neurons was found in chronic HFD-SN that was restored by metformin. Taken together, our data suggest that the dysregulation of Parkin–PARIS–PGC-1α pathway by metabolic malregulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of PD and metformin might exert a neuroprotective effect on PD via the restoration of parkin.

AB  - Abstract
Cerebral ischemic injury involves death of multiple cell types at the ischemic sites. As a key regulator of cell death, the p53 gene has been implicated in the regulation of cell loss in stroke. Less focal damage is found in stroke animals pre-treated with a p53 inhibitor or in traditional p53 knockout (ko) mice. However, whether the p53 gene plays a direct role in regulating neuronal cell death is unknown. In this study, in contrast to the global inhibition of p53 function by pharmacological inhibitors and in traditional p53 ko mice, we utilized a neuronal specific conditional ko mouse line (CamcreTRP53 loxP/loxP) to achieve forebrain neuronal specific deletion of p53 and examined the role of the p53 gene in ischemia-induced cell death in neurons. Expression of p53 after stroke is examined using the immunohistochemical method and the outcome of stroke is examined by analysis of infarction size and behavioral deficits caused by stroke. Our data showed that p53 expression is upregulated in the ischemic region in neuronal cells in wildtype (wt) mice but not in CamcreTRP53 loxP/loxP ko mice. Deletion of the p53 gene in forebrain neurons results in a decreased infarction area in ko mice. Locomotor behavior, measured in automated activity chambers, showed that CamcreTRP53 loxP/loxP ko mice have less locomotor deficits compared to wt mice after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). We conclude that manipulation of p53 expression in neurons may lead to unique therapeutic development in stroke.

AB  - Abstract
Our laboratory previously developed a novel neuropathic and inflammatory facial pain model for mice referred to as the Trigeminal Inflammatory Compression (TIC) model. Rather than inducing whole nerve ischemia and neuronal loss, this injury induces only slight peripheral nerve demyelination triggering long-term mechanical allodynia and cold hypersensitivity on the ipsilateral whisker pad. The aim of the present study is to further characterize the phenotype of the TIC injury model using specific behavioral assays (i.e. light–dark box, open field exploratory activity, and elevated plus maze) to explore pain- and anxiety-like behaviors associated with this model. Our findings determined that the TIC injury produces hypersensitivity 100% of the time after surgery that persists at least 21 weeks post injury (until the animals are euthanized). Three receptive field sensitivity pattern variations in mice with TIC injury are specified. Animals with TIC injury begin displaying anxiety-like behavior in the light–dark box preference and open field exploratory tests at week eight post injury as compared to sham and naïve animals. Panic anxiety-like behavior was shown in the elevated plus maze in mice with TIC injury if the test was preceded with acoustic startle. Thus, in addition to mechanical and cold hypersensitivity, the present study identified significant anxiety-like behaviors in mice with TIC injury resembling the clinical symptomatology and psychosocial impairments of patients with chronic facial pain. Overall, the TIC injury model’s chronicity, reproducibility, and reliability in producing pain- and anxiety-like behaviors demonstrate its usefulness as a chronic neuropathic facial pain model.

AB  - Abstract
Aversive experiences in early life are thought to dispose to psychopathologies such as mood or anxiety disorders. In a two-hit stress model, we assessed the effects of juvenile and/or adult stress on the 5-HT-mediated modulation of synaptic inhibition of ventral dentate gyrus granule cells. Combined but not single stress exposure led to a significant reduction in activity and increased anxiety-like behavior. Similarly, the 5-HT1A receptor-mediated inhibition of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) of granule cells was only reduced in single stress exposed animals. This was also true for the number of granule cells responding with a 5-HT3 receptor-dependent burst of miniature IPSCs. 5-HT3 receptors are expressed on cholecystokinin (CCK)+ basket cells in the hippocampus. In fact, we observed a reduction of steady-state mRNA levels of CCK+ basket cell markers after single juvenile or adult stress and partial recovery after combined stress, thus matching the electrophysiological findings. Adaptive changes in 5-HT-mediated modulation of synaptic inhibition and CCK+ basket cells in the DG may help to maintain normal levels of anxiety after single juvenile or adult stress exposure, as indicated by the increased anxiety that accompanies the loss of this regulation upon combined stress.

Converging evidences suggest that mental movement simulation and actual movement production share similar neurocognitive and learning processes. Although a large body of data is available in the literature regarding mental states involving the dominant arm, examinations for the nondominant arm are sparse. Does mental training, through motor-imagery practice, with the dominant arm or the nondominant arm is equally efficient for motor learning? In the current study, we investigated laterality effects in motor learning by motor-imagery practice. Four groups of right-hander adults mentally and physically performed as fast and accurately as possible (speed/accuracy trade-off paradigm) successive reaching movements with their dominant or nondominant arm (physical-training-dominant-arm, mental-training-dominant-arm, physical-training-nondominant-arm, and mental-training-nondominant-arm groups). Movement time was recorded and analyzed before, during, and after the training sessions. We found that physical and mental practice had a positive effect on the motor performance (i.e., decrease in movement time) of both arms through similar learning process (i.e., similar exponential learning curves). However, movement time reduction in the posttest session was significantly higher after physical practice than motor-imagery practice for both arms. More importantly, motor-imagery practice with the dominant arm resulted in larger and more robust improvements in movement speed compared to motor-imagery practice with the nondominant arm. No such improvements were observed in the control group. Our results suggest a superiority of the dominant arm in motor learning by mental practice. We discussed these findings from the perspective of the internal models theory.

AB  - Abstract
Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is a predominantly nuclear, ubiquitously expressed RNA and DNA-binding protein. It recognizes and binds to UG repeats and is involved in pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA stability and microRNA metabolism. TDP-43 is essential in early embryonic development but accumulates in cytoplasmic aggregates in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and tau-negative frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). It is not known yet whether cytoplasmic aggregates of TDP-43 are toxic or protective but they are often associated with a loss of TDP-43 from the nucleus and neurodegeneration may be caused by a loss of normal TDP-43 function or a gain of toxic function. Here we present a proteomic study to analyze the effect of loss of TDP-43 on the proteome. MS data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD001668. Our results indicate that TDP-43 is an important regulator of RNA metabolism and intracellular transport. We show that Ran-binding protein 1 (RanBP1), DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha (Dnmt3a) and chromogranin B (CgB) are downregulated upon TDP-43 knockdown. Subsequently, transportin 1 level is increased as a result of RanBP1 depletion. Improper regulation of these proteins and the subsequent disruption of cellular processes may play a role in the pathogenesis of the TDP-43 proteinopathies ALS and FTLD.

AB  - Abstract
Reconsolidation has been defined as the process of memory stabilization after retrieval involving, among others, gene expression regulation and post-translational modifications. Many of these mechanisms are shared with memory consolidation. Here, we studied hippocampal ERK participation on memory reconsolidation of an inhibitory avoidance task in CF-1 mice. We found a retrieval-induced cytosolic ERK2 activation in the hippocampus (HIP) 15 min after memory reactivation, and an inhibition at 45 min. PD098059, a MEK1/2 (MAPK/ERK kinase) inhibitor, administered in the HIP immediately after retrieval impaired memory in a dose-dependent fashion. However, infusions of the highest dose of PD098059 performed 40 min after retrieval enhanced memory in mice trained with a weaker footshock. These results suggest for the first time that ERK2 is involved in memory reconsolidation in a biphasic fashion. Furthermore, the inhibition of ERK could either impair or enhance mice performance depending on ERK state of activation.

AB  - Abstract
The present study investigated the vestibulospinal system which originates from the spinal vestibular nucleus (SpVe) with both retrograde and anterograde tracer injections. We found that fluoro-gold (FG) labeled neurons were found bilaterally with a contralateral predominance after FG injections into the upper lumbar cord. Anterogradely labeled fibers from the rostral SpVe traveled in the medial part of the ventral funiculus ipsilaterally and the dorsolateral funiculus bilaterally in the cervical cord. They mainly terminated in laminae 5–8, and 10 of the ipsilateral spinal cord. The contralateral side had fewer fibers and they were found in laminae 6–8, and 10. In the thoracic cord, fibers were also found to terminate in bilateral intermediolateral columns. In the lumbar and lower cord, fibers were mainly found in the dorsolateral funiculus bilaterally and they terminated predominantly in laminae 3–7 contralaterally. Anterogradely labeled fibers from the caudal SpVe did not travel in the medial part of the ventral funiculus but in the dorsolateral funiculus bilaterally. They mainly terminated in laminae 3–8 and 10 contralaterally. The present study is the first to describe the termination of vestibulospinal fibers arising from the SpVe in the spinal cord. It will lay the anatomical foundation for those who investigate the physiological role of vestibulospinal fibers and potentially target these fibers during rehabilitation after stroke, spinal cord injury, or vestibular organ injury.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic ethanol consumption is known to downregulate expression of the major glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1), which increases extracellular glutamate concentrations in subregions of the mesocorticolimbic reward pathway. While β-lactam antibiotics were initially identified as potent upregulators of GLT-1 expression, only ceftriaxone has been extensively studied in various drug addiction models. Therefore, in this study, adult male alcohol-preferring (P) rats exposed chronically to ethanol were treated with other β-lactam antibiotics, ampicillin, cefazolin or cefoperazone (100 mg/kg) once daily for five consecutive days to assess their effects on ethanol consumption. The results demonstrated that each compound significantly reduced ethanol intake compared to the saline-treated control group. Importantly, each compound significantly upregulated both GLT-1 and pAKT expressions in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex compared to saline-treated control group. In addition, only cefoperazone significantly inhibited hepatic aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 enzyme activity. Moreover, these β-lactams exerted only a transient effect on sucrose drinking, suggesting specificity for chronically inhibiting ethanol reward in adult male P rats. Cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of ampicillin, cefazolin or cefoperazone have been confirmed using high-performance liquid chromatography. These findings demonstrate that multiple β-lactam antibiotics demonstrate efficacy in reducing alcohol consumption and appear to be potential therapeutic compounds for treating alcohol abuse and/or dependence. In addition, these results suggest that pAKT may be an important player in this effect, possibly through increased transcription of GLT-1.

AB  - Abstract
Working memory (WM) impairment has received attention as a behavioral characteristic of schizophrenia. Neurobiological studies have led to the hypothesis that a deficit in dopamine transmission through D1 receptors in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is associated with WM impairment in schizophrenia. However, empirical approaches that aim to clarify the nature of the impairment and its underlying mechanism are difficult to enact, especially in unmedicated patients. By contrast, computational approaches using biologically plausible models have formed a powerful theoretical framework for the study of WM impairment in schizophrenia. This article attempts to directly connect neurobiological findings to the neuropsychological behaviors present in patients with schizophrenia. Using a biologically plausible prefrontal cortical circuit model, we simulated sustained activity during a simultaneous, multi-target WM task. We subsequently analyzed how dopaminergic modulation via D1 receptor activation alters the capacity and precision of WM and investigated the underlying mechanism. Hypodopaminergic modulation resulted in imprecision and a reduced capacity in WM primarily due to decreased N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) conductance. Increasing NMDA conductance ameliorated both impairments. These results account for the mechanism that underlies WM impairments in schizophrenia and provide a theoretical basis for combination therapy with antipsychotic drugs and drugs that enhance NMDA receptor function, which is expected to be effective for the treatment of WM impairments in these patients.

AB  - Abstract
The amygdalar basolateral nuclear complex (BLC) is a cortex-like structure that receives inputs from many cortical areas. It has long been assumed that cortico-amygdalar projections, as well as inter-areal intracortical connections, arise from cortical pyramidal cells. However, recent studies have shown that GABAergic long-range nonpyramidal neurons (LRNP neurons) in the cortex also contribute to inter-areal connections. The present study combined Fluorogold (FG) retrograde tract tracing with immunohistochemistry for cortical nonpyramidal neuronal markers to determine if cortical LRNP neurons project to the BLC in the rat. Injections of FG into the BLC produced widespread retrograde labeling in the cerebral hemispheres and diencephalon. Triple-labeling for FG, somatostatin (SOM), and neuropeptide Y (NPY) revealed a small number of FG+/SOM+/NPY+ neurons and FG+/SOM+/NPY− neurons in the lateral entorhinal area, amygdalopiriform transition area, and piriform cortex, but not in the prefrontal and insular cortices, or in the diencephalon. In addition, FG+/SOM+/NPY+ neurons were observed in the amygdalostriatal transition area and in a zone surrounding the intercalated nuclei. About half of the SOM+ neurons in the lateral entorhinal area labeled by FG were GABA+. FG+ neurons containing parvalbumin were only seen in the basal forebrain, and no FG+ neurons containing vasoactive intestinal peptide were observed in any brain region. Since LRNP neurons involved in corticocortical connections are critical for synchronous oscillations that allow temporal coordination between distant cortical regions, the LRNP neurons identified in this study may play a role in the synchronous oscillations of the BLC and hippocampal region that are involved in the retrieval of fear memories.

AB  - Abstract
Voltage-gated sodium channel blockers are not traditionally recommended for osteoarthritis (OA) pain therapy, but given the large peripheral drive that follows OA development there is a rationale for their use. Using a rat model of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-induced OA we used in vivo electrophysiology to assess the effects of the Nav1.7- and Nav1.8-selective antagonists, ProTxII and A-803467 respectively, on the evoked activity of spinal dorsal horn neurons in response to electrical, mechanical and thermal stimuli applied to the peripheral receptive field. These studies allow examination of the roles of these channels in suprathreshold stimuli, not amenable to behavioral threshold measures. Spinal administration of ProTxII significantly reduced neuronal responses evoked by mechanical punctate (von Frey (vF) 8–60 g) and noxious thermal (45 and 48 °C) stimuli in MIA rats only. A-803467 significantly inhibited neuronal responses evoked by vF 8–60 g and 48 °C heat after spinal administration; significantly inhibited responses evoked by brush, vFs 26–60 g and 40–48 °C stimuli after systemic administration; significantly inhibited the electrically evoked Aδ-, C-fiber, post-discharge, Input and wind-up responses and the brush, vFs 8–60 g and 45–48 °C evoked neuronal responses after intra plantar injection in the MIA group. In comparison A-803467 effects in the sham group were minimal and included a reduction of the neuronal response evoked by vF 60 g and 45 °C heat stimulation after spinal administration, no effect after systemic administration and an inhibition of the evoked response to 45 °C heat after intra plantar injection only. The observed selective inhibitory effect of ProTxII and A-803467 for the MIA-treated group suggests an increased role of Nav1.7 and 1.8 within nociceptive pathways in the arthritic condition, located at peripheral and central sites. These findings demonstrate the importance of, and add to, the mechanistic understanding of these channels in osteoarthritic pain.

AB  - Abstract
There is evidence that noradrenergic coeruleo-cortical projections are involved in different forms of cognitive flexibility. So far, no studies in humans have investigated the involvement of beta receptors on task-switching performance, a well-established measure of cognitive flexibility. The present study investigated whether the administration of propranolol (a central and peripheral beta-adrenergic antagonist) affected switching costs (i.e., the increase of reaction time in task-switching trials relative to task-repetition trials). Sixteen healthy adult human subjects performed a global–local task-switching paradigm in a double-blind, within-subjects design study investigating the effects of 80 mg of propranolol hydrochloride (a β1 and β2 adrenergic receptor antagonist) vs. an oral dose of microcrystalline cellulose (placebo pill).

The acute administration of propranolol did not affect the size of switching costs compared to the intake of the neutral placebo. Our results, corroborated by Bayesian inference, suggest that beta receptors do not modulate cognitive flexibility as measured by task-switching performance.

AB  - Abstract
We recently indicated that the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protects neurons against hypoxic death via enhancement of tyrosine phosphorylation of Kv1.2, an isoform of the delayed-rectifier potassium channels through activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) signaling pathway. The present study investigated whether VEGF could attenuate ischemia-induced increase of the potassium currents in the hippocampal pyramidal neurons of rats after ischemic injury. Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to induce brain ischemia. The whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used to record the potassium currents of hippocampal neurons in brain slices from the ischemically injured brains of the rats 24 h after MCAO. We detected that transient MCAO caused a significant increase of voltage-gated potassium currents (Kv) and outward delayed-rectifier potassium currents (IK), but not outward transient potassium currents (IA), in the ipsilateral hippocampus compared with the sham. Moreover, we found that VEGF could acutely, reversibly and voltage-dependently inhibit the ischemia-induced IK increase. This inhibitory effect of VEGF could be completely abolished by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3-K. Our data indicate that VEGF attenuates the ischemia-induced increase of IK via activation of the PI3-K signaling pathway.

AB  - Abstract
Cortical spreading depression (SD) is a transient propagating neuronal excitation followed by depression, which is generally accepted as the underlying cause of migraine. The inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor activation not only reduces cortical SD frequency and propagation, but also relieves migraine headache. This study aims to determine the role of major α subtypes of GABAA receptor in mediating SD genesis and propagation using an efficient in vitro chick retinal model. We firstly demonstrated that abundant α2, and to a lesser extent, α5 of GABAA receptor expression in the chick retina, enabled the tissue useful for studying GABAA receptor pharmacology and SD. Marked suppression of SD by SL651498 and TPA023 was observed at 10 μmol L−1 and 50 μmol L−1, respectively, suggesting a critical role of GABAA receptor α subtypes, in particular α2, in modulating retinal SD elicitation and propagation. The negative data on NS11394 at 3 μmol L−1 on SD and the little positive selectivity of TPA023 for α5 did not support that α5 subtype is involved in SD genesis and propagation. Our data provide strong evidence that α2, but not α5 is involved in the early stage of migraine, indicating that α2 subtype is a possible drug target related to migraine with aura.

AB  - Abstract
Agonists of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are currently being considered as therapeutic approaches for managing cognitive deficits in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Present study was designed to evaluate the effect of α7 nAChR selective activation by PHA-543613 (PHA) on beta-amyloid (Aβ)25–35-mediated cognitive deficits in mice.

For this purpose, PHA (1 mg/kg, i.p.), a selective α7 nAChR agonist, and galantamine (Gal) (3 mg/kg, s.c.), an acetylcholine-esterase inhibitor (AChEI) effects on α7 nAChR were tested in Aβ25–35-received (intracerebroventricular, 10 nmol) mice model of AD. Methyllycaconitine (MLA) (1 mg/kg, i.p.), a α7 nAChR antagonist, was used for receptor blockage effects evaluation. Working and reference memory in animals was assessed by the Morris water maze (MWM) task. The mRNA and protein levels of α7 subunit were analyzed by real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively.

PHA and Gal, ameliorate Aβ-impaired working and reference memory. However, Gal had less effect than PHA in this regard. Pretreatment with MLA reverses both Gal and PHA effects in MWM. PHA and Gal treatment prevent Aβ-induced α7 subunit protein reduction, but Gal has lesser effect than PHA. This effect blocked by pretreatment with MLA. In neither the pretreatment nor treatment group, the mRNA levels of nAChR α7 subunit were significantly changed.

Therefore, α7 nAChR activation, reduces Aβ-induced cognitive deficits and increases the α7 protein level and subsequent neuron survival. However, blockage of receptor, increases Aβ toxicity and cognitive impairment and reduces the α7 nAChR protein level and flowing neuroprotection.

AB  - Abstract
Recent research suggests that long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) is followed by a transitory period of late cortical disinhibition (LCD) that can even lead to a net increase in cortical excitability. The relationship between LICI/LCD and voluntary drive remains poorly understood. Our study aims at investigating the influence of index abduction on LICI and LCD in an actively engaged muscle and a neighboring muscle, while varying the intensity of the conditioning stimulus (CS). Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the first dorsal interosseus (FDI) and abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles in 13 subjects. Paired-pulses were delivered with 10 different interstimulus intervals (ranging from 60 to 290 ms). Whatever the condition (relaxed or active FDI), the test stimulus was set to evoke an MEP of 1 mV. The time course of conditioned MEP amplitude was compared for relaxed and active conditions when the CS intensity was set to (i) 130% of the rest motor threshold (RMT) or (ii) to evoke the same size of MEP under both conditions. LICI lasted longer (i.e. disinhibition occurred later) at rest than during abduction when evoked either by similar or matched conditioning stimuli. No post-LICI facilitation was observed at rest – even when the CS intensity was set to 160% RMT. In contrast, long-interval intracortical facilitation (LICF) was observed in the quiescent ADM when FDI was active. LICF may then be associated with voluntary activity albeit with lack of topographic specificity.

AB  - Abstract
Estradiol-induced plasticity involves changes in dendritic spine density and in the relative proportions of the different dendritic spine types that influence neurons and neural circuits. Such events affect brain structures that control the timing of neuroendocrine and behavioral processes, influencing both reproductive and cognitive functions during the estrous cycle. Accordingly, to investigate the dendritic spine-related plastic changes that may affect the neural processes involved in mating, estradiol-mediated dendritic spine plasticity was studied in type II cells situated in the ventrolateral portion of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN) of female, adult rats. The rats were assigned to four different groups (n = 6) in function of their stage in the estrous cycle: proestrus, estrus, metaestrus, and diestrus. Dendritic spine density and the proportions of the different spine types on type II neurons were analyzed in the ventrolateral region of the VMN of these animals. Dendritic spine density on primary dendrites of VMN type II neurons was significantly lower in metaestrus than in diestrus, proestrus and estrus (with no differences between these latter stages). However, a significant variation in the proportional density of the different spine types was found, with a higher proportion of thin spines in diestrus, proestrus and estrus than in metaestrus. Likewise, a higher proportion of mushroom spines was seen in diestrus and proestrus than in metaestrus, and a higher proportion of stubby spines in estrus than in diestrus and metaestrus. Very few branched spines were found during proestrus and they were not detected during estrus or metaestrus.

The different types of dendritic spines in non-projection neurons of the VMN could serve to maintain greater synaptic excitatory activity when receptivity and estradiol levels are maximal. However, they may also fulfill an additional functional role when receptivity and estradiol decline. To date specific roles of the different types of spines in neural hypothalamic activity during the estrous cycle remain unknown and they clearly deserve further study.

AB  - Abstract
Amplitudes of mu and beta (7–26 Hz) oscillations measured by electroencephalography over the sensorimotor areas are suppressed during motor imagery as well as during voluntary movements. This phenomenon is referred to as event-related desynchronization (ERD) and is known to reflect motor cortical excitability. The increased motor cortical excitability associated with ERD during hand motor imagery would induce a descending cortical volley to spinal motoneurons, resulting in facilitation of spinal motoneuronal excitability. Therefore, in the present study, we tested the association of ERD during motor imagery with the excitability of spinal motoneurons in 15 healthy participants. Spinal excitability was tested using the F-wave recorded from the right abductor pollicis brevis muscle. The F-wave results from antidromic activation of spinal motoneurons and is induced by peripheral nerve stimulation. Participants performed 5 s of motor imagery of right thumb abduction following 7 s of rest. The right median nerve was stimulated at wrist level when the ERD magnitude of the contralateral hand sensorimotor area exceeded predetermined thresholds during motor imagery. The results showed ERD magnitude during hand motor imagery was associated with an increase in F-wave persistence, but not with the response average of F-wave amplitude or F-wave latency. These findings suggest that the ERD magnitude may be a biomarker representing increases in the excitability of both cortical and spinal levels.

AB  - Abstract
An increasing number of data support the involvement of disturbances in glucose metabolism in the pathogenesis of depression. We previously reported that glucose and glycogen concentrations in brain structures important for depression are higher in a prenatal stress model of depression when compared with control animals. A marked rise in the concentrations of these carbohydrates and glucose transporters were evident in prenatally stressed animals subjected to acute stress and glucose loading in adulthood. To determine whether elevated levels of brain glucose are associated with a change in its metabolism in this model, we assessed key glycolytic enzymes (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase), products of glycolysis, i.e., pyruvate and lactate, and two selected enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Additionally, we assessed glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, a key enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Prenatal stress increased the levels of phosphofructokinase, an important glycolytic enzyme, in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. However, prenatal stress had no effect on hexokinase or pyruvate kinase levels. The lactate concentration was elevated in prenatally stressed rats in the frontal cortex, and pyruvate levels remained unchanged. Among the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, prenatal stress decreased the level of pyruvate dehydrogenase in the hippocampus, but it had no effect on α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Like in the case of glucose and its transporters, also in the present study, differences in markers of glucose metabolism between control animals and those subjected to prenatal stress were not observed under basal conditions but in rats subjected to acute stress and glucose load in adulthood. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was not reduced by prenatal stress but was found to be even higher in animals exposed to all experimental conditions, i.e., prenatal stress, acute stress, and glucose administration. Our data indicate that glycolysis is increased and the Krebs cycle is decreased in the brain of a prenatal stress animal model of depression.

AB  - Abstract
A functional polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) within the serotonin transporter gene (SERT) has been associated with personality dimensions such as neuroticism, with emotional reactivity to negative events, and with an increased risk of affective disorders. More specifically, the short (S) allele of 5-HTTLPR has been linked to increased amygdala activity and has been identified as a risk allele for depressive disorders. Recently, Homberg and Lesch (2011) urged for a conceptual change in the current deficit-oriented connotation of the 5-HTTLPR S-allele and argued that the S-allele could be considered adaptive in certain contexts. They postulated that S-allele carriers show hypervigilant behavior in social situations and should thus show increased social conformity. Therefore, we tested whether 5-HTTLPR modulates the neural correlates of real-life social joint action through functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Thirty participants, homozygote for 5-HTTLPR, were measured and analyzed while they were involved in a previously published joint-action paradigm, which reliably leads to an activation of the left parietal cortex. We found that homozygote S-allele carriers showed increased inferior parietal lobe activation, compared to the LL-allele carriers for the contrast “joint action greater solo action”. Therefore, our results provide evidence for beneficial effects of the S-allele on the neural correlates of social interactions.

AB  - Abstract
Stress is known to elicit various adaptive or maladaptive responses in the nervous system function. Psychophysical studies have revealed that stress exposure induced the changes in auditory response that can be interpreted as a transient, stress-induced hypersensitivity to sounds. However, the underlying neural mechanism remains unresolved. Thus, in this study, we explored the neural activities of the auditory cortex (AC) in response to stress. We elicited stress by physically immobilizing rats and recorded the extracellular single-unit activities through the electrodes chronically implanted in the AC of rats. By comparing the spike activities of the same rat before, during and after immobilization, we found temporal and significant changes in the sound-evoked neural activities. In most cases, acute restraint stress enhanced neural responses evoked by pure-tones and click-trains, but in a minority of neurons, stress suppressed responses. The immobilization-induced enhancement was more frequently found in the neurons that originally had a low responsibility for sound stimuli. The enhancement effects on pure-tone response were reflected by an increase of response magnitude, decrease of response latency, and extension of bandwidth of tuning curve (BW). But the spontaneous firing rate and best frequency (BF) remained unchanged. Stress also increased the ability of neural response to synchronize to click-trains, even in the neurons whose response magnitude was not significantly increased. Taken together, these results provide direct evidence that stress alters the function of auditory system at the level of AC.

AB  - Abstract
(1S,2E,4R,6R,-7E,11E)-2,7,11-cembratriene-4,6-diol (4R) is a precursor to key flavor ingredients in leaves of Nicotiana species. The present study shows 4R decreased brain damage in rodent ischemic stroke models. The 4R-pretreated mice had lower infarct volumes (26.2 ± 9.7 mm3) than those in control groups (untreated: 63.4 ± 4.2 mm3, DMSO: 60.2 ± 14.2 mm3). The 4R-posttreated rats also had less infarct volumes (120 ± 65 mm3) than those in the rats of the DMSO group (291 ± 95 mm3). The results from in vitro experiments indicate that 4R decreased neuro2a cell (neuroblastoma cells) apoptosis induced by oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD), and improved the population spikes’ (PSs) recovery in rat acute hippocampal slices under OGD; a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, wortmannin, abolished the effect of 4R on PSs recovery. Furthermore, 4R also inhibited monocyte adhesion to murine brain-derived endothelial (bEND5) cells and upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1(ICAM-1) induced by OGD/reoxygenation (OGD/R), and restored the p-Akt level to pre-OGD/R values in bEND5 cells.

In conclusion, the present study indicates that 4R has a protective effect in rodent ischemic stroke models. Inhibition of ICAM-1 expression and restoration of Akt phosphorylation are the possible mechanisms involved in cellular protection by 4R.

AB  - Abstract
Reduced catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity resulting from genetic variation or pharmacological depletion results in enhanced pain perception in humans and nociceptive behaviors in animals. Using phasic mechanical and thermal reflex tests (e.g. von Frey, Hargreaves), recent studies show that acute COMT-dependent pain in rats is mediated by β-adrenergic receptors (βARs). In order to more closely mimic the characteristics of human chronic pain conditions associated with prolonged reductions in COMT, the present study sought to determine volitional pain-related and anxiety-like behavioral responses following sustained as well as acute COMT inhibition using an operant 10–45 °C thermal place preference task and a light/dark preference test. In addition, we sought to evaluate the effects of sustained COMT inhibition on generalized body pain by measuring tactile sensory thresholds of the abdominal region. Results demonstrated that acute and sustained administration of the COMT inhibitor OR486 increased pain behavior in response to thermal heat. Further, sustained administration of OR486 increased anxiety behavior in response to bright light, as well as abdominal mechanosensation. Finally, all pain-related behaviors were blocked by the non-selective βAR antagonist propranolol. Collectively, these findings provide the first evidence that stimulation of βARs following acute or chronic COMT inhibition drives cognitive-affective behaviors associated with heightened pain that affects multiple body sites.

AB  - Abstract
The present review is focused on neural mechanisms responsible of group III and IV muscle afferent actions on central motor drive during physical exercise in both healthy and pathological populations. It seems that these mechanisms contribute to improve muscle performance by regulating the peripheral fatigue development and by avoiding excessive muscle impairments. Therefore, a great deal of attention is paid to their influences on motor unit activation during fatiguing exercise both in human and animal models. Recent evidence indicated that these afferents from a given active muscle could contribute to regulate the motor activity of the homonymous as well as surrounding skeletal muscles by acting at both spinal and supraspinal levels. In addition, given that the recovery of the sensory feedback plays a key role in the improvement of motor function following numerous neuromuscular traumas, the role of these afferents in preclinical and clinical situations is also explored in animal and human models. It is supposed that studying the motor and autonomic functions of group III and IV afferents might help healthcare professionals in the future to find appropriate treatments and rehabilitation programs.

The intracerebroventicular administration (i.c.v.) of glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) had antidepressant-like effects on saline-treated mice in the forced-swim test. The GLP-2 treatment (3 μg, i.c.v.) for 6 days, but not that of imipramine had antidepressant-like effects on adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-treated mice. The immunohistochemical detection of the c-fos protein (Fos) revealed that the administration of GLP-2 induced Fos-immunoreactivity (Fos-IR) in the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus in saline-treated and ACTH-treated mice, and also in the hippocampal dentate gyrus in ACTH-treated mice, but not in saline-treated mice. In contrast, Fos-IR in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus decreased after the administration of GLP-2 to ACTH-treated mice. In ACTH-treated mice, the chronic administration of GLP-2 affected hippocampal neurogenesis, in addition to Fos-IR in hypothalamic GABAergic neurons and corticotrophin-releasing factor-containing neurons. These results suggest that GLP-2 acts on specific brain regions to regulate stress conditions, and induces antidepressant-like effects under imipramine-resistant conditions, which may be associated with the modulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal-axis.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic delivery of neuropeptides in the brain is a useful experimental approach to study their long-term effects on various biological parameters. In this work, we tested albumin-alginate microparticles, as a potential delivery system, to study if continuous release in the hypothalamus of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), an anorexigenic neuropeptide, may result in a long-term decrease in food intake and body weight. The 2-week release of α-MSH from peptide-loaded particles was confirmed by an in vitro assay. Then, daily food intake and body weight were studied for 18 days in rats injected bilaterally into the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus with particles loaded or not with α-MSH. A decrease in body weight gain, persisting throughout the study, was found in rats injected with α-MSH-charged particles as compared with rats receiving non-charged particles and with rats injected with the same dose of α-MSH in solution. Food intake was significantly decreased for 3 days in rats receiving α-MSH-loaded particles and it was not followed by the feeding rebound effect which appears after food restriction. The presence of α-MSH-loaded particles in the hypothalamus was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. In conclusion, our study validates albumin-alginate microparticles as a new carrier system for long-term delivery of neuropeptides in the brain and demonstrates that chronic delivery of α-MSH in the hypothalamus results in a prolonged suppression of food intake and a decrease of body weight gain in rats.

AB  - Abstract
Cellular therapy has provided hope for restoring neurological function post stroke through promoting endogenous neurogenesis, angiogenesis and synaptogenesis. The current study was based on the observation that transplantation of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) promoted the neurological function improvement in stroked mice and meanwhile enhanced angiogenesis in the stroked hemisphere. Grafted hUCMSCs secreted human vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Notch1 signaling was activated after stroke and also in the grafted hUCMSCs. To address the potential mechanism that might mediate such pro-angiogenic effect, we established a hUCMSC-neuron co-culture system. Neurons were subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) injury before co-culturing to mimic the in vivo cell transplantation. Consistent with the in vivo data, co-culture medium claimed from hUCMSC-OGD neuron co-culture system significantly promoted the capillary-like tube formation of brain-derived endothelial cells. Moreover, coincident with our in vivo data, Notch 1 signaling activation was detected in hUCMSCs after co-cultured with OGD neurons as demonstrated by the up-regulation of key Notch1 signaling components Notch1 and Notch1 intercellular domain (NICD). In addition, OGD-neuron co-culture also increased the VEGF-A production by hUCMSCs. To verify whether Notch1 activation was involved in the pro-angiogenic effect, γ-secretase inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) was added into the co-culture medium before co-culture. It turned out that DAPT significantly prevented the Notch1 activation in hUCMSCs after co-culture with OGD neurons. More importantly, the pro-angiogenic effect of hUCMSCs was remarkably abolished by DAPT addition as demonstrated by inhibited capillary-like tube formation and less VEGF-A production. Regarding how Notch1 signaling was linked with VEGF-A secretion, we provided some clue that Notch1 effector Hes1 mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated by OGD-neuron co-culturing and down-regulated after additional treatment of DAPT. In summary, our data provided evidence that the VEGF-A secretion from hUCMSCs after being triggered by OGD neurons is Notch1 signaling associated. This might be a possible mechanism that contributes to the angiogenic effect of hUCMSC transplantation in stroked brain.

AB  - Abstract
Oligomer formation is considered as a critical process for the neurotoxic effects of Alzheimer’s amyloid β (Aβ) peptide. Previously we have demonstrated that lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) increases the oligomer formation of Aβ1–42, the major Aβ peptide found Alzheimer’s disease (AD) lesions. In this study, we have investigated whether LPC affects the neurotoxic effects of Aβ1–42 in a neuronal cell line (A1) culture. Dimethyl thiazolyl diphenyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay revealed that up to 10 μM concentration, LPC did not affect A1 cell viability. Aβ1–42 decreased the cell viability, and such effect was dose dependently enhanced by LPC. However, neither LPC nor Aβ1–42, alone or in combination increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release from A1 cells after 24-h treatment. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP-biotin nick-end-labeling (TUNEL) assay showed that LPC increased Aβ1–42-induced apoptotic cell number. To determine the underlying mechanisms, the proteins implicated in apoptosis pathways including Bcl-2- and caspase-family were analyzed by Western blotting. The results demonstrated that Aβ1–42 decreased Bcl-2 in A1 cells at 24 h, whereas LPC had no effect at any time point. Both LPC and Aβ1–42 increased Bax level at 24 h, and their combined stimulation showed a synergistic effect. Similar synergistic effect of LPC and Aβ1–42 on caspase9 activation was observed. Dot blot immunoassay and Western blotting showed that LPC augmented Aβ1–42 oligomer formation in cell culture medium. Removing LPC-induced early-formed Aβ1–42 oligomer from the culture medium by immunoprecipitation decreased active caspase9 level and neurotoxicity, as revealed by Western blotting and MTT assay. Furthermore, dihydroethidium (DHE) assay showed that Aβ1–42 increased reactive oxygen species level in A1 cells, such effect was further enhanced by LPC. Thus, our results demonstrated that LPC increased the oligomer formation process of Aβ1–42 peptide in culture condition, and consequently increased apoptotic neuronal death. Such process might be important for the pathogenesis of AD, and inhibition of LPC generation could be a therapeutic target for the disease.

AB  - Abstract
Standards-referenced educational reform has increased the prevalence of standardized testing; however, whether these tests accurately measure students’ competencies has been questioned. This may be due to domain-specific assessments placing a differing domain-general cognitive load on test-takers. To investigate this possibility, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to identify and quantify the neural correlates of performance on current, international standardized methods of spelling assessment. Out-of-scanner testing was used to further examine differences in assessment results. Results provide converging evidence that: (a) the spelling assessments differed in the cognitive load placed on test-takers; (b) performance decreased with increasing cognitive load of the assessment; and (c) brain regions associated with working memory were more highly activated during performance of assessments that were higher in cognitive load. These findings suggest that assessment design should optimize the cognitive load placed on test-takers, to ensure students’ results are an accurate reflection of their true levels of competency.

AB  - Abstract
Somatostatin is a 14–28 amino acid peptide that is located not only in the gastrointestinal system but also in multiple sites of the human brain. The inhibitory effect of somatostatin on the growth hormone (GH) secretion of the pituitary gland is a well-established phenomenon. There is a general consensus that somatostatin is released into the hypophysial portal blood and modulates GH secretion by hormonal action. In the present study, we explored the possibility that in addition to the hormonal route, somatostatin may also influence GH secretion via influencing the growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) secretion by direct contacts that may be functional synapses.

Since the verification of these putative synapses by electron microscopy is virtually impossible in humans due to the long post mortem time, in order to reveal the putative somatostatinergic-GHRH juxtapositions, light microscopic double-label immunohistochemistry was utilized.

By examining the slides with high magnification, we observed that the vast majority of the GHRH perikarya received contacting somatostatinergic axonal varicosities in the arcuate nucleus. In contrast, GHRH axonal varicosities rarely contacted somatostatinergic perikarya.

The morphology and the abundance of somatostatin to GHRH juxtapositions indicate that these associations are functional synapses, and they represent, at least partially, the morphological substrate of the somatostatin-influenced GHRH secretion. Thus, in addition to influencing the GH secretion directly via the hypophysial portal system, somatostatin may also modulate GH release from the anterior pituitary by regulating the hypothalamic GHRH secretion via direct contacts. The rare GHRH to somatostatin juxtapositions indicate that the negative feedback effect of GH targets the somatostatinergic system directly and not via the GHRH system.

AB  - Abstract
Inner ear damage can lead to hearing disorders, including tinnitus, hyperacusis, and hearing loss. We measured the effects of severe inner ear damage, produced by cochlear ablation, on the levels and distributions of amino acids in the first brain center of the auditory system, the cochlear nucleus. Measurements were also made for its projection pathways and the superior olivary nuclei. Cochlear ablation produces complete degeneration of the auditory nerve, which provides a baseline for interpreting the effects of partial damage to the inner ear, such as that from ototoxic drugs or intense sound. Amino acids play a critical role in neural function, including neurotransmission, neuromodulation, cellular metabolism, and protein construction. They include major neurotransmitters of the brain – glutamate, glycine, and γ-aminobutyrate (GABA) – as well as others closely related to their metabolism and/or functions – aspartate, glutamine, and taurine. Since the effects of inner ear damage develop over time, we measured the changes in amino acid levels at various survival times after cochlear ablation. Glutamate and aspartate levels decreased by 2 weeks in the ipsilateral ventral cochlear nucleus and deep layer of the dorsal cochlear nucleus, with the largest decreases in the posteroventral cochlear nucleus (PVCN): 66% for glutamate and 63% for aspartate. Aspartate levels also decreased in the lateral part of the ipsilateral trapezoid body, by as much as 50%, suggesting a transneuronal effect. GABA and glycine levels showed some bilateral decreases, especially in the PVCN. These results may represent the state of amino acid metabolism in the cochlear nucleus of humans after removal of eighth nerve tumors, which may adversely result in destruction of the auditory nerve. Measurement of chemical changes following inner ear damage may increase understanding of the pathogenesis of hearing impairments and enable improvements in their diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - AbstractBackground
High mortality and morbidity rates are observed in patients with bacterial meningitis (BM) and urge for new adjuvant treatments in addition to standard antibiotic therapies. In BM the hippocampal dentate gyrus is injured by apoptosis while in cortical areas ischemic necrosis occurs. Experimental therapies aimed at reducing the inflammatory response and brain damage have successfully been evaluated in animal models of BM. Fluoxetine (FLX) is an anti-depressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and was previously shown to be neuroprotective in vitro and in vivo. We therefore assessed the neuroprotective effect of FLX in experimental pneumococcal meningitis.
Methods
Infant rats were infected intracisternally with live Streptococcus pneumoniae. Intraperitoneal treatment with FLX (10 mg kg−1 d−1) or an equal volume of NaCl was initiated 15 min later. 18, 27, and 42 h after infection, the animals were clinically (weight, clinical score, mortality) evaluated and subject to a cisternal puncture and inflammatory parameters (i.e., cyto-/chemokines, myeloperoxidase activity, matrix metalloproteinase concentrations) were measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. At 42 h after infection, animals were sacrificed and the brains collected for histomorphometrical analysis of brain damage.
Results
A significant lower number of animals treated with FLX showed relevant hippocampal apoptosis when compared to littermates (9/19 animals vs 18/23, P = 0.038). A trend for less damage in cortical areas was observed in FLX-treated animals compared to controls (13/19 vs 13/23, P = ns). Clinical and inflammatory parameters were not affected by FLX treatment.
Conclusion
A significant neuroprotective effect of FLX on the hippocampus was observed in acute pneumococcal meningitis in infant rats.

AB  - Abstract
Prialt, a synthetic version of Cav2.2 antagonist ω-conotoxin MVIIA derived from Conus magus, is the first clinically approved voltage-gated calcium channel blocker for refractory chronic pain. However, due to the narrow therapeutic window and considerable side effects associated with systemic dosing, Prialt is only administered intrathecally. N-triazole oxindole (TROX-1) is a novel use-dependent and activation state-selective small-molecule inhibitor of Cav2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 calcium channels designed to overcome the limitations of Prialt. We have examined the neurophysiological and behavioral effects of blocking calcium channels with TROX-1. In vitro, TROX-1, in contrast to state-independent antagonist Prialt, preferentially inhibits Cav2.2 currents in rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons under depolarized conditions. In vivo electrophysiology was performed to record from deep dorsal horn lamina V/VI wide dynamic range neurons in non-sentient spinal nerve-ligated (SNL) and sham-operated rats. In SNL rats, spinal neurons exhibited reduced responses to innocuous and noxious punctate mechanical stimulation of the receptive field following subcutaneous administration of TROX-1, an effect that was absent in sham-operated animals. No effect was observed on neuronal responses evoked by dynamic brushing, heat or cold stimulation in SNL or sham rats. The wind-up response of spinal neurons following repeated electrical stimulation of the receptive field was also unaffected. Spinally applied TROX-1 dose dependently inhibited mechanically evoked neuronal responses in SNL but not sham-operated rats, consistent with behavioral observations. This study confirms the pathological state-dependent actions of TROX-1 through a likely spinal mechanism and reveals a modality selective change in calcium channel function following nerve injury.

AB  - Abstract
Mounting experimental evidence, predominantly from male rodents, demonstrates that high-fat diet (HFD) consumption and ensuing obesity are detrimental to the brain. To shed additional light on the neurological consequences of HFD consumption in female rodents and to determine the relatively early impact of HFD in the likely continuum of neurological dysfunction in the context of chronic HFD intake, this study investigated effects of HFD feeding for up to 12 weeks on selected behavioral, neurochemical, and electrophysiological parameters in adult female C57BL/6 mice; particular focus was placed on the ventral hippocampus (vHIP). Selected locomotor, emotional and cognitive functions were evaluated using behavioral tests after 5 weeks on HFD or control (low-fat diet) diets. One week later, mice were sacrificed and brain regional neurochemical (monoamine) analysis was performed. Behaviorally naïve mice were maintained on their respective diets for an additional 5–6 weeks at which time synaptic plasticity was determined in ex vivo slices from the vHIP. HFD-fed female mice exhibited increased: (i) locomotor activity in the open field testing, (ii) mean turn time on the pole test, (iii) swimming time in the forced swim test, and (iv) number of marbles buried in the marble burying test. In contrast, the novel object recognition memory was unaffected. Mice on HFD also had decreased norepinephrine and dopamine turnover, respectively, in the prefrontal cortex and the vHIP. HFD consumption for a total of 11–12 weeks altered vHIP synaptic plasticity, evidenced by significant reductions in the paired-pulse ratio and long-term potentiation (LTP) magnitude. In summary, in female mice, HFD intake for several weeks induced multiple behavioral alterations of mainly anxiety-like nature and impaired monoamine pathways in a brain region-specific manner, suggesting that in the female, certain behavioral domains (anxiety) and associated brain regions, i.e., the vHIP, are preferentially targeted by HFD.

AB  - Abstract
Bisabolol is a plant-derived monocyclic sesquiterpene alcohol with antinociceptive and antiinflammatory actions. However, molecular targets mediating these effects of bisabolol are poorly understood. In this study, using a two-electrode voltage-clamp and patch-clamp techniques and live cellular calcium imaging, we have investigated the effect of bisabolol on the function of human α7 subunit of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in Xenopus oocytes, interneurons of rat hippocampal slices. We have found that bisabolol reversibly and concentration dependently (IC50 = 3.1 μM) inhibits acetylcholine (ACh)-induced α7 receptor-mediated currents. The effect of bisabolol was not dependent on the membrane potential. Bisabolol inhibition was not changed by intracellular injection of the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA and perfusion with Ca2+-free solution containing Ba2+, suggesting that endogenous Ca2+-dependent Cl− channels are not involved in bisabolol actions. Increasing the concentrations of ACh did not reverse bisabolol inhibition. Furthermore, the specific binding of [125I] α-bungarotoxin was not attenuated by bisabolol. Choline-induced currents in CA1 interneurons of rat hippocampal slices were also inhibited with IC50 of 4.6 μM. Collectively, our results suggest that bisabolol directly inhibits α7-nAChRs via a binding site on the receptor channel.

AB  - Abstract
Syntaxins are a family of transmembrane proteins that participate in SNARE complexes to mediate membrane fusion events including exocytosis. Different syntaxins are thought to participate in exocytosis in different compartments of the nervous system such as the axon, the soma/dendrites or astrocytes. It is well known that exocytosis of synaptic vesicles at axonal presynaptic terminals involves syntaxin 1 but distributions of syntaxins on neuronal somal and dendritic, postsynaptic or astroglial plasma membranes are less well characterized. Here, we use pre-embedding immunogold labeling to compare the distribution of two plasma membrane-enriched syntaxins (1 and 4) in dissociated rat hippocampal cultures as well as in perfusion-fixed mouse brains. Comparison of Western blots of neuronal cultures, consisting of a mixture of hippocampal neurons and glia, with glial cultures, consisting of mostly astrocytes, shows that syntaxin 1 is enriched in neuronal cultures, whereas syntaxin 4 is enriched in glial cultures. Electron microscopy (EM)-immunogold labeling shows that syntaxin 1 is most abundant at the plasma membranes of axons and terminals, while syntaxin 4 is most abundant at astroglial plasma membranes. This differential distribution was evident even at close appositions of membranes at synapses, where syntaxin 1 was localized to the plasma membrane of the presynaptic terminal, including that at the active zone, while syntaxin 4 was localized to nearby peri-synaptic astroglial processes. These results show that syntaxin 4 is available to support exocytosis in astroglia.

AB  - Abstract
To evaluate physiological roles of the large, second cytoplasmic loops (C2) situated between the M3 and M4 transmembrane domains of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits. We have constructed chimeric β2 (β2χ) and β4 (β4χ) subunits in which the “nested” C2 domains (but not the “proximal” sequences of ∼14 residues immediately adjacent to the M3 or M4 domains) of these β subunits were replaced by the corresponding sequence from the serotonin 5-HT3A receptor subunit. We previously reported that heterologously expressed nAChR containing α4 and β2χ subunits displayed a faster whole-cell current decay in its agonist response compared to responses of all-wild-type α4β2-nAChR. This suggests an unexpected, functional role for the C2 domain of the β2 subunit in α4β2-nAChR acute desensitization. Here we report that there also is faster desensitization of α4β4χ-nAChR relative to α4β4-nAChR stably and heterologously expressed in the human SH-EP1 cell-line. In addition, cell-attached, single-channel recording shows that both acetylcholine-activated α4β2χ- and α4β4χ-nAChR have a significantly lower mean open probability, shorter mean open-time, and a longer mean closed-time than their fully wild-type counterparts while not having different conductance amplitudes. These findings reveal microscopic bases for the faster desensitization of α4∗-nAChR containing chimeric instead of wild-type β subunits. Our findings also remain consistent with novel and unexpected roles of β subunit-nested C2 domains in modulation of α4∗-nAChR function.

AB  - Abstract
Abuse and addiction to prescription opioids such as oxycodone (a short-acting Mu opioid receptor (MOP-r) agonist) in adolescence is a pressing public health issue. We have previously shown differences in oxycodone self-administration behaviors between adolescent and adult C57BL/6J mice and expression of striatal neurotransmitter receptor genes, in areas involved in reward. In this study, we aimed to determine whether oxycodone self-administration differentially affects genes regulating synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of adolescent compared to adult mice, since the hippocampus may be involved in learning aspects associated with chronic drug self administration. Hippocampus was isolated for mRNA analysis from mice that had self administered oxycodone (0.25 mg/kg/infusion) 2 h/day for 14 consecutive days or from yoked saline controls. Gene expression was analyzed with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a commercially available “synaptic plasticity” PCR array containing 84 genes. We found that adolescent and adult control mice significantly differed in the expression of several genes in the absence of oxycodone exposure, including those coding for mitogen-activated protein kinase, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II gamma subunit, glutamate receptor, ionotropic AMPA2 and metabotropic 5. Chronic oxycodone self administration increased proviral integration site 1 (Pim1) and thymoma viral proto-oncogene 1 mRNA levels compared to controls in both age groups. Both Pim1 and cadherin 2 mRNAs showed a significant combined effect of Drug Condition and Age × Drug Condition. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of both cadherin 2 and cAMP response element modulators showed an experiment-wise significant difference between oxycodone and saline control in adult but not in adolescent mice. Overall, this study demonstrates for the first time that chronic oxycodone self-administration differentially alters synaptic plasticity gene expression in the hippocampus of adolescent and adult mice.

AB  - Abstract
The possible involvement of the PI3K/AKT/BDNF/VGF signaling in rapid-acting antidepressant-like effects of antidepressants has been explored progressively by more studies. However, whether this signaling participates in the antidepressant-like effects of acetyl-l-carnitine (ALC) has not been examined. Herein, we assessed the antidepressant-like effects of ALC using the forced swimming test (FST). Our results demonstrated the dose–effect relationship of acute administration of ALC (5, 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg, i.p.) and showed that it dose-dependently decreased the immobility time on FST of mice. In addition, ALC (100 mg/kg, i.p.) also reversed depressive-like behavior and the down-regulation of phosphorylated AKT (pAKT), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neuropeptide VGF in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of mice induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) paradigm. Further, intra-cerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusions of LY294002 (10 nmol/side), a specific phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, significantly prevented the antidepressant-like effect of ALC (100 mg/kg, i.p.). In conclusion, our results demonstrated that ALC exerts rapid-acting antidepressant-like effects that might be mediated by the PI3K/AKT/BDNF/VGF signaling pathway.

AB  - Abstract
The amygdala, prefrontal cortex, striatum and other connected forebrain areas are important for reward-associated learning and subsequent behaviors. How these structurally and functionally dissociable regions are recruited during initial learning, however, is unclear. Recently, we showed amygdalar nuclei were differentially recruited across different stages of cue-food associations in a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm. Here, we systematically examined Fos induction in the forebrain, including areas associated with the amygdala, during early (day 1) and late (day 10) training sessions of cue-food conditioning. During training, rats in the conditioned group received tone-food pairings, while controls received presentations of the tone alone in the conditioning chamber followed by food delivery in their home cage. We found that a small subset of telencephalic and hypothalamic regions were differentially recruited during the early and late stages of training, suggesting evidence of learning-induced plasticity. Initial tone-food pairings recruited solely the amygdala, while late tone-food pairings came to induce Fos in distinct areas within the medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, the dorsal striatum, and the hypothalamus (lateral hypothalamus and paraventricular nucleus). Furthermore, within the perifornical lateral hypothalamus, tone-food pairings selectively recruited neurons that produce the orexigenic neuropeptide orexin/hypocretin. These data show a functional map of the forebrain areas recruited by appetitive associative learning and dependent on experience. These selectively activated regions include interconnected prefrontal, striatal, and hypothalamic regions that form a discrete but distributed network that is well placed to simultaneously inform cortical (cognitive) processing and behavioral (motivational) control during cue-food learning.

AB  - Abstract
Norepinephrine acting via β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs) plays an important role in hippocampal plasticity including the subiculum which is the principal target of CA1 pyramidal cells and which controls information transfer from the hippocampus to other brain regions including the neighboring presubiculum and the entorhinal cortex (EC). Subicular pyramidal cells are classified as regular- (RS) and burst-spiking (BS) cells. Activation of β-ARs at CA1-subiculum synapses induces long-term potentiation (LTP) in burst- but not in RS cells (Wójtowicz et al., 2010). To elucidate seizure-associated disturbances in the norepinephrine-dependent modulation of hippocampal output, we investigated the functional consequences of the β-AR-dependent synaptic plasticity at CA1-subiculum synapses for the transfer of hippocampal output to the parahippocampal region in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Using single-cell and multi-channel field recordings in slices, we studied β-AR-mediated changes in the functional connectivity between CA1, the subiculum and its target-structures. We confirm that application of the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol induces LTP in subicular BS- but not RS cells. Due to the distinct spatial distribution of RS- and BS cells in the proximo-to-distal axis of the subiculum, in field recordings, LTP was significantly stronger in the distal than in the proximal subiculum. In pilocarpine-treated animals, β-AR-mediated LTP was strongly reduced in the distal subiculum. The attenuated LTP was associated with a disturbed polysynaptic transmission from the CA1, via the subiculum to the presubiculum, but with a preserved transmission to the medial EC. Our findings suggest that synaptic plasticity may influence target-related information flow and that such regulation is disturbed in pilocarpine-treated epileptic rats.

AB  - Abstract
In the present study, the effects of bilateral injections of dopaminergic drugs into the hippocampal CA1 regions (intra-CA1) on harmaline-induced amnesia were examined in male mice. A one-trial step-down passive avoidance task was used for the assessment of memory retention in adult male mice. Pre-training intra-peritoneal (i.p.) administration of harmaline (1 mg/kg) induced impairment of memory retention. Moreover, intra-CA1 administration of dopamine D1 receptor antagonist, SCH23390 (0.02 μg/mouse), dopamine D1 receptor agonist, SKF38393 (0.5 μg/mouse), dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, sulpiride (1 μg/mouse) and dopamine D2 receptor agonist, quinpirole (0.25 and 0.5 μg/mouse) suppressed the learning of a single-trial passive avoidance task. Also, pre-training intra-CA1 injection of subthreshold doses of SCH23390 (0.001 μg/mouse) or sulpiride (0.25 μg/mouse) with the administration of harmaline (1 mg/kg, i.p.) reversed impairment of memory formation. However, pre-training intra-CA1 injection of SKF38393 (0.1 μg/mouse) or quinpirole (0.1 μg/mouse) increased pre-training harmaline (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced retrieval impairment. Moreover, SKF Ca blocker (SKF) (0.01 μg/mouse) decrease the amnesia induced by harmaline (1 mg/kg), while co-administration of SKF (0.01 μg/mouse)/sulpiride (0.25 μg/mouse) or SCH23390 (0.001 μg/mouse)/sulpiride (0.25 μg/mouse) potentiate amnesia caused by harmaline. These findings implicate the involvement of CA1 dopaminergic mechanism in harmaline-induced impairment of memory acquisition.

AB  - AbstractBackground
The progressive loss of memory and autonomy of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients, together with their characteristic behavioral and psychological symptoms, subjects their family caregivers to chronic stress. Several studies indicate that these caregivers are predisposed to cognitive impairments, but the physiological correlates of these alterations remain to be elucidated.
Objective
Analyze the effects of chronic stress of family caregivers of AD patients on cognition, cortisol/DHEA ratios and BDNF levels and investigate the relation between these variables.
Experimental procedure
Seventeen family caregivers (64.83 ± 3.64 years) of patients with AD and eighteen non-caregivers (58.29 ± 3.16 years) completed stress, depression and anxiety inventories. Exclusion criteria were current neurological disorders, major unstable medical illnesses, use of medications that could interfere with cognitive or HPA axis function and dementia. Attention, working memory and executive function were assessed with Digit Span and Trail Making tests, and declarative memory was analyzed with the Logical Memory test. Saliva was collected at 8 AM and 10 PM and its cortisol and DHEA levels determined by radioimmunoassay. Serum BDNF levels were measured by sandwich-ELISA. Results were analyzed with independent samples t test, covariance analysis and linear regressions. The statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05 and all p values were adjusted with Holm’s Method.
Results
Caregivers showed more stress, depression and anxiety symptoms than non-caregivers, as well as significantly worse performances on attention, working memory and executive function tests. Caregivers also had higher cortisol/DHEA ratios and lower BDNF levels than non-caregivers. Cortisol/DHEA ratios, especially at 10 PM, were negatively related with all cognitive tasks in which caregivers showed impaired performance. On the other hand, the only cognitive task that related with the BDNF level was digit span.
Conclusions
This study showed that caregivers’ cognitive impairment is related with alterations on cortisol/DHEA ratios, and that chronic stress experienced by these subjects has the potential to alter their BDNF levels.

AB  - Abstract
Oxidative stress is central to the pathology of several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease (PD), and therapeutics designed to enhance antioxidant potential could have clinical value. In this study, we investigated whether dimethyl fumarate (DMF) has therapeutic effects in cellular and animal model of PD, and explore the role of nuclear transcription factor related to NF-E2 (Nrf2) in this process. Treatment of animals and dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells with DMF resulted in increased nuclear levels of active Nrf2, with subsequent upregulation of antioxidant target genes. The cytotoxicity of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) was reduced by pre-treatment with DMF in SH-SY5Y cells. The increase in the reactive oxygen species caused by 6-OHDA treatment was also attenuated by DMF in SH-SY5Y cells. The neuroprotective effects of DMF against 6-OHDA neurotoxicity were dependent on Nrf2, since treatment with Nrf2 siRNA failed to block against 6-OHDA neurotoxicity and induce Nrf2-dependent cytoprotective genes in SH-SY5Y cells. In vivo, DMF oral administration was shown to upregulate mRNA and protein levels of Nrf2 and Nrf2-regulated cytoprotective genes, attenuate 6-OHDA induced striatal oxidative stress and inflammation in C57BL/6 mice. Moreover, DMF ameliorated dopaminergic neurotoxicity in 6-OHDA-induced PD animal models as evidenced by amelioration of locomotor dysfunction, loss in striatal dopamine, and reductions in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and striatum. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that DMF may be beneficial for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases like PD.

AB  - Abstract
Monge’s disease, also known as chronic mountain sickness (CMS), is a disease that potentially threatens more than 140 million highlanders during extended time living at high altitudes (over 2500 m). The prevalence of CMS in Andeans is about 15–20%, suggesting that the majority of highlanders (non-CMS) are rather healthy at high altitudes; however, CMS subjects experience severe hypoxemia, erythrocytosis and many neurologic manifestations including migraine, headache, mental fatigue, confusion, and memory loss. The underlying mechanisms of CMS neuropathology are not well understood and no ideal treatment is available to prevent or cure CMS, except for phlebotomy. In the current study, we reprogrammed fibroblast cells from both CMS and non-CMS subjects’ skin biopsies into the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), then differentiated into neurons and compared their neuronal properties. We discovered that CMS neurons were much less excitable (higher rheobase) than non-CMS neurons. This decreased excitability was not caused by differences in passive neuronal properties, but instead by a significantly lowered Na+ channel current density and by a shift of the voltage-conductance curve in the depolarization direction. Our findings provide, for the first time, evidence of a neuronal abnormality in CMS subjects as compared to non-CMS subjects, hoping that such studies can pave the way to a better understanding of the neuropathology in CMS.

AB  - Abstract
The μ opioid receptor (MOR) and κ opioid receptor (KOR) have been implicated in pair-bond formation and maintenance in socially monogamous species. Utilizing monogamous titi monkeys (Callicebus cupreus), the present study examined the potential role opioids play in modulating the response to separation, a potent challenge to the pair-bond. In Experiment 1, paired male titi monkeys were separated from their pair-mate for 30-min and then received saline, naloxone (1.0 mg/kg), morphine (0.25 mg/kg), or the KOR agonist, U50,488 (0.01, 0.03, or 0.1 mg/kg) in a counter-balanced fashion, immediately prior to a 30-min reunion with their mate. Blood samples were collected immediately prior to and after the reunion. Males receiving morphine approached females less, initiated contact less, and females broke contact with the males less. The increase in cortisol in response to naloxone was greater compared to vehicle, and the increase in cortisol in response to the high dose of U50,488 compared to vehicle approached significance. In Experiment 2, paired males were treated with the KOR antagonist, GNTI (0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 mg/kg), or saline 24 h prior to a 60-min separation from their mate. Blood samples were collected at the time of injection and immediately before and after separation. Administration of the low dose of GNTI decreased the locomotor component of the separation response compared to vehicle. The present study found that the opioid system is involved in both the affiliative and separation distress components of a pair-bond, and these components are regulated by different opioid receptors.

AB  - Abstract
Mounting evidence suggests that brain inflammation mediated by glial cells may contribute to epileptogenesis. Minocycline is a second-generation tetracycline and has potent antiinflammatory effects independent of its antimicrobial action. The present study aimed to investigate whether minocycline could exert antiepileptogenic effects in a rat lithium-pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. The temporal patterns of microglial and astrocytic activation were examined in the hippocampal CA1 and the adjacent cortex following pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE). These findings displayed that SE caused acute and persistent activation of microglia and astrocytes. Based on these findings, Minocycline was administered once daily at 45 mg/kg for 14 days following SE. Six weeks after termination of minocycline treatment, spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) were recorded by continuous video monitoring. Minocycline inhibited the SE-induced microglial activation and the increased production of interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α in the hippocampal CA1 and the adjacent cortex, without affecting astrocytic activation. In addition, Minocycline prevented the SE-induced neuronal loss in the brain regions examined. Moreover, minocycline significantly reduced the frequency, duration, and severity of SRS during the two weeks monitoring period. These results demonstrated that minocycline could mitigate SE-induced brain inflammation and might exert disease-modifying effects in an animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy. These findings offer new insights into deciphering the molecular mechanisms of epileptogenesis and exploring a novel therapeutic strategy for prevention of epilepsy.

AB  - Abstract
Hearing impairment contributes to cognitive dysfunction. Previous studies have found changes of functional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN) associated with cognitive processing in individuals with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Whereas the changes in the DMN in patients with long-term unilateral SNHL (USNHL) is still not entirely clear. In this work, we analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and neuropsychological test scores from normal hearing subjects (n = 11) and patients (n = 21) with long-term USNHL. Functional connectivity and nodal topological properties were computed for every brain region in the DMN. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and post hoc analyses were conducted to identify differences between normal controls and patients for each measure. Results indicated that the left USNHL presented enhanced connectivity (p &lt; 0.05, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected), and significant changes (p &lt; 0.05, Bonferroni corrected) of the nodal topological properties in the DMN compared with the control. More changes in the DMN have been found in the left than right long-term USNHL (RUSNHL). However, the neuropsychological tests did not show significant differences between the USNHL and the control. These findings suggest that long-term USNHL contributes to changes in the DMN, and these changes might affect cognitive abilities in patients with long-term USNHL. Left hearing loss affects the DMN more than the right hearing loss does. The fMRI measures might be more sensitive for observing cognitive changes in patients with hearing loss than clinical neuropsychological tests. This study provides some insights into the mechanisms of the association between hearing loss and cognitive function.

AB  - Abstract
In the dorsal facial area (DFA) of the medulla, an activation of either P2 purinergic receptor or nitric oxide synthase (NOS) results in the release of glutamate, leading to an increase in blood flow of the common carotid artery (CCA). It is not known whether activation of the P2 receptor by ATP may mediate activation of NOS/guanylyl cyclase to cause glutamate release and/or whether l-Arg (nitric oxide (NO) precursor) may also cause ATP release from any other neuron, to cause an increase in CCA flow. We demonstrated that microinjections of P2 receptor agonists (ATP, α,β-methylene ATP) or NO precursor (l-arginine) into the DFA increased CCA blood flow. The P2-induced CCA blood flow increase was dose-dependently reduced by pretreatment with NG-nitro-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME, a non-specific NOS inhibitor), 7-nitroindazole (7-NI, a relatively selective neuronal NOS inhibitor) or methylene blue (MB, a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor) but not by that with d-NAME (an isomer of l-NAME) or N5-(1-iminoethyl)-l-ornithine (l-NIO, a potent endothelial NOS inhibitor). Involvement of glutamate release in these responses were substantiated by microdialysis studies, in which perfusions of ATP into the DFA increased the glutamate concentration in dialysates, but co-perfusion of ATP with l-NAME or 7-NI did not. Nevertheless, the arginine-induced CCA blood flow increase was abolished by combined pretreatment of l-NAME and MB, but not affected by pretreatment with a selective P2 receptor antagonist, pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulphonic acid (PPADS). In conclusion, ATP activation of the P2 receptor in the DFA induced activation of neuronal NOS/guanylyl cyclase, which causes glutamate release leading to an increase in CCA blood flow. However, arginine activation of neuronal NOS/guanylyl cyclase, which also caused glutamate release and CCA blood flow increase, did not induce activation of P2 receptors. These findings provide important information for drug design and/or developing therapeutic strategies for the diseases associated with CCA blood flow that supplies intra- and extra-cranial tissues.

A large body of evidence indicates that individual differences in baseline concentrations of testosterone (T) are only weakly correlated with human aggression. Importantly, T concentrations are not static, but rather fluctuate rapidly in the context of competitive interactions, suggesting that acute fluctuations in T may be more relevant for our understanding of the neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying variability in human aggression. In this paper, we provide an overview of the literature on T and human competition, with a primary focus on the role of competition-induced T dynamics in the modulation of human aggression. In addition, we discuss potential neural mechanisms underlying the effect of T dynamics on human aggression. Finally, we highlight several challenges for the field of social neuroendocrinology and discuss areas of research that may enhance our understanding of the complex bi-directional relationship between T and human social behavior.

AB  - Abstract
The calsyntenins are atypical members of the cadherin superfamily that have been implicated in learning in Caenorhabditis elegans and memory formation in humans. As members of the cadherin superfamily, they could mediate cell–cell adhesion, although their adhesive properties have not been investigated. As an initial step in characterizing the calsyntenins, we have cloned clstn1, clstn2 and clstn3 from the zebrafish and determined their expression in the developing zebrafish nervous system. The three genes each have broad, yet distinct, expression patterns in the zebrafish brain. Each of the ectodomains mediates homophilic interactions through two, amino-terminal cadherin repeats. In bead sorting assays, the calsyntenin ectodomains do not exhibit homophilic preferences. These data support the idea that calsyntenins could either act as adhesion molecules or as diffusible, homophilic or heterophilic ligands in the vertebrate nervous system.

AB  - Abstract
Neonatal seizures caused by perinatal asphyxia and hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy can be refractory to conventional anticonvulsants. This may be due to the depolarizing effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) achieved by the activity of the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter (NKCC1). The aim of this study is to evaluate the long-term effects of bumetanide, a NKCC1 inhibitor, on hippocampal neurogenesis and seizure susceptibility in hypoxia-induced neonatal seizure model. Wistar rats were subjected to hypoxia-induced neonatal seizures at postnatal day 10 (P10). Following acute seizures, the rats were treated with intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of bumetanide at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg for 3 weeks. In later adulthood, hypoxia-induced seizures increased the number of newborn dentate gyrus cells (DGCs), promoted mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) and reduced the apical dendritic complexity of newborn DGCs 1 month after the insults. In addition, these seizures resulted in long-lasting consequences, such as spontaneous electroencephalography (EEG) seizures, though spatial learning impairments were not seen. Bumetanide treatments significantly enhanced cell proliferation and dendritic development of newborn DGCs after neonatal seizures, accompanied by the decreased seizure activity. However, systemic administration of bumetanide resulted in much lower brain concentrations, and was incompatible with NKCC1 inhibition in blood–brain barrier (BBB)-protected brain tissue. Our results suggested that bumetanide might have long-term effects in suppressing seizure activity, and altering the neurogenesis after neonatal seizures. These effects of bumetanide may be mediated by the targets outside the BBB-protected central nerve system (CNS) or CNS-located target(s) other than NKCC1.

The aim of this study was to examine how feedback, or its absence, affects children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) during a visuo-manual tracking task. This cross-sectional study included 40 children with DCD and 40 typically developing (TD) children between 6 and 10 years old. Participants were required to track a target moving along a circular path presented on a monitor by moving an electronic pen on a digitizing tablet. The task was performed under two visibility conditions (target visible throughout the trajectory and target intermittently occluded) and at two different target velocities (30° and 60° per second). Variables reflecting tracking success and tracking behavior within the target were compared between groups. Results showed that children with DCD were less proficient in tracking a moving target than TD children. Their performance deteriorated even more when the target was occluded and when the target speed increased. The mean tracking speed of the DCD group exceeded the speed at which the target rotated which was attributed to accelerations and decelerations made during tracking. This suggests that children with DCD have significant difficulties in visuo-manual tracking especially when visual feedback is reduced. It appears that their impaired ability to predict together with impairments in fine-tuning arm movements may be responsible for poor performance in the intermittently occluded visuo-manual tracking task.

AB  - Abstract
The central vestibular system plays an important role in higher neural functions such as self-motion perception and spatial orientation. Its ability to store head angular velocity is called velocity storage mechanism (VSM), which has been thoroughly investigated across a wide range of species. However, little is known about the mouse VSM, because the mouse lacks typical ocular responses such as optokinetic after nystagmus or a dominant time constant of vestibulo-ocular reflex for which the VSM is critical. Experiments were conducted to examine the otolith-driven eye movements related to the VSM and verify its characteristics in mice. We used a novel approach to generate a similar rotating vector as a traditional off-vertical axis rotation (OVAR) but with a larger resultant gravito-inertial force (&gt;1 g) by using counter rotation centrifugation. Similar to results previously described in other animals during OVAR, two components of eye movements were induced, i.e. a sinusoidal modulatory eye movement (modulation component) on which a unidirectional nystagmus (bias component) was superimposed. Each response is considered to derive from different mechanisms; modulations arise predominantly through linear vestibulo-ocular reflex, whereas for the bias, the VSM is responsible. Data indicate that the mouse also has a well-developed vestibular system through otoliths inputs, showing its highly conserved nature across mammalian species. On the other hand, to reach a plateau state of bias, a higher frequency rotation or a larger gravito-inertial force was considered to be necessary than other larger animals. Compared with modulation, the bias had a more variable profile, suggesting an inherent complexity of higher-order neural processes in the brain. Our data provide the basis for further study of the central vestibular system in mice, however, the underlying individual variability should be taken into consideration.

AB  - Abstract
Neuroprotection of the spinal cord during the early phase of injury is an important goal to determine a favorable outcome by prevention of delayed pathological events, including excitotoxicity, which otherwise extend the primary damage and amplify the often irreversible loss of motor function. While intensive care and neurosurgical intervention are important treatments, effective neuroprotection requires further experimental studies focused to target vulnerable neurons, particularly motoneurons. The present investigation examined whether the volatile general anesthetic methoxyflurane might protect spinal locomotor networks from kainate-evoked excitotoxicity using an in vitro rat spinal cord preparation as a model. The protocols involved 1 h excitotoxic stimulation on day 1 followed by electrophysiological and immunohistochemical testing on day 2. A single administration of methoxyflurane applied together with kainate (1 h), or 30 or even 60 min later prevented any depression of spinal reflexes, loss of motoneuron excitability, and histological damage. Methoxyflurane per se temporarily decreased synaptic transmission and motoneuron excitability, effects readily reversible on washout. Spinal locomotor activity recorded as alternating electrical discharges from lumbar motor pools was fully preserved on the second day after application of methoxyflurane together with (or after) kainate. These data suggest that a volatile general anesthetic could provide strong electrophysiological and histological neuroprotection that enabled expression of locomotor network activity 1 day after the excitotoxic challenge. It is hypothesized that the benefits of early neurosurgery for acute spinal cord injury (SCI) might be enhanced if, in addition to injury decompression and stabilization, the protective role of general anesthesia is exploited.

AB  - Abstract
Reports suggest that silent information regulation 2 homolog 3 (SIRT3) protects cardiomyocytes from oxidative stress-mediated death. SIRT3, a mitochondrial protein, is an essential regulator of mitochondrial function, and this regulation is important in many cerebrovascular diseases, especially stroke. Here, we investigated the role of SIRT3 in ischemia-induced neuronal death due to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) using an in vitro model of cerebral ischemia. We found that exposure of differentiated PC12 cells to OGD for 6 h caused a marked decrease in cell viability and up regulated SIRT3. SIRT3 knockdown using short interfering RNA (siRNA) exacerbated OGD-induced injury whereas application of recombinant SIRT3 protected against OGD-induced cell death. Pre-treatment of the cells in which the SIRT3 gene was knocked down with recombinant SIRT3 before OGD partially restored cell viability and concomitantly reduced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and increased ATP generation in mitochondria. Recombinant SIRT3 treatment resulted in increased expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-γ co-activator 1-α (PGC-1α) and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). After knockdown of PGC-1α or MnSOD, recombinant SIRT3 failed to protect against OGD-induced injury. We also found that the protein and mRNA expression of PGC-1α was down regulated following SIRT3 knockdown. The expression level of SIRT3 was reduced when the PGC-1α gene was knocked down. Both SIRT3 and PGC-1α knockdown led to reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ) and Ca2+ transients, especially under OGD conditions. Thus, our data suggest that SIRT3 protects PC12 cells from hypoxic injury via a mechanism that may involve PGC-1α and MnSOD. SIRT3 and PGC-1α regulate each other under physiologic and OGD conditions, thereby partially protecting against hypoxia or ischemia.

AB  - Abstract
Recent studies of both healthy and patient populations have cast doubt on the mirror paradigm’s beneficial effect on motor behavior. Indeed, the voluntary arm displacement that accompanies reflection in the mirror may be the determining factor in terms of the motor behavior of the contralateral arm. The objective of the present study was to assess the respective effects of mirror reflection and arm displacement (whether real or simulated) on involuntary motor behavior of the contralateral arm following sustained, isometric contraction (Kohnstamm phenomenon). Our results revealed that (i) passive displacement of one arm (displacement of the left arm via a motorized manipulandum moving at 4°/s) influenced the velocity of the Kohnstamm phenomenon (forearm flexion occurring shortly after the cessation of muscle contraction) in the contralateral arm and (ii) mirror vision had no effect. Indeed, the velocity of the Kohnstamm phenomenon tended to be adjusted to match the velocity of the passive displacement of the other arm. In a second experiment, arm displacement was simulated by vibrating the triceps at 25, 50 or 75 Hz. Results showed that the velocity of the Kohnstamm phenomenon in one arm increased with the vibration frequency applied to the other arm. Our results revealed the occurrence of bimanual coupling because involuntary displacement of one arm was regulated by muscle-related information generated by the actual or simulated displacement of the other arm. In line with the literature data on voluntary motor behavior, our study failed to evidence an additional impact of mirror vision on involuntary motor behavior.

AB  - Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) represents a severe health problem worldwide usually associated with severe disability and reduced quality of life. The aim of this work was to investigate the role of prohibitin 1 (PHB1) in the progression of SCI in rats. Firstly, we observed that expression of PHB1 was downregulated following SCI in rats. Then, we hypothesized that PHB1 overexpression by delivery of Ad-PHB1 could result in neuroprotection and promote functional recovery following SCI. Briefly, Wistar rats received a 35-g clip-compression injury and were administered Ad-PHB1 or Ad immediately following SCI. It was found that Ad-PHB1 administration significantly improved locomotor function and increased pain tolerance in rats with SCI. Furthermore, Ad-PHB1 administration following SCI attenuated axonal degradation and increased neuron sparing. Ad-PHB1 administration following SCI reduced apoptosis through inhibiting the Bcl-2/Bax/caspase-3 pathway. Ad-PHB1 administration following SCI suppressed endoplasmic reticulum stress, evidenced by reduced mRNA levels of CCAAT enhancer binding protein homologous protein, chaperone-ucose-regulated protein 78, and X-box protein 1. Ad-PHB1 administration following SCI restored mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate formation, reduced reactive oxygen species formation, and improved mitochondrial respiration rates. Finally, Ad-PHB1 administration following SCI activated downstream signals including phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), and nuclear factor-kappaB. These data indicate that the PHB1 plays an important role in the development of SCI and might provide a therapeutic target to promote recovery from SCI.

AB  - Abstract
Polycytosine-binding proteins (PCBPs) are RNA-binding proteins that participate in post-transcriptional control pathways. Among the diverse functions of these proteins is the interaction with a 27 nucleotide pyrimidine-rich domain within the 3′UTR of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA. Mutations to this domain result in decreased stability of TH mRNA and loss of cAMP-mediated activation of TH mRNA translation. PCBPs are hypothesized to play key roles in these regulatory mechanisms. In order to further test this hypothesis, we examined the tissue distribution of PCBPs in catecholaminergic cells. Initial studies demonstrated that proteins from catecholaminergic tissues bind to TH mRNA 3′UTR sequences and these proteins have an apparent Mr of ∼44 kDa, which is close to the molecular sizes for PCBPs. Fluorescent immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy was used to analyze the distribution of PCBP isoforms in TH-positive cells of the rat midbrain, locus coeruleus, and adrenal gland. Our results suggest that: (1) PCBP2 is the predominant isoform in TH-positive cells of the rat midbrain; (2) PCBP3 is the predominant isoform in TH-positive cells of the locus coeruleus; and (3) PCBP1 is the predominant isoform in the adrenal medulla. The localization of PCBP proteins to TH-positive cells in these catecholaminergic tissues is consistent with the hypothesis that PCBPs play a role in the regulation of TH expression.

AB  - Abstract
Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) after stroke enhances not only functional reorganization but also structural plasticity of the brain in the adult rats. We examined whether forced limb-use which mimicked CIMT could influence ischemia-induced neurogenesis, apoptosis and behavioral recovery in the aged rats. Aged rats were divided into a sham group, an ischemia group, and an ischemia group with forced limb-use. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by injection of endothelin-1. Forced limb-use began on post-stroke day 7 by fitting a plaster cast around the unimpaired upper limbs of rats for 3 weeks. Behavioral recovery was evaluated by tapered/ledged beam-walking test on postoperative day 32. The expression of doublecortin, neuronal nuclei, glial fibrillary acidic protein and Iba-1 were measured by single or double immunohistochemistry, and apoptosis was measured by TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. The production of neuroblasts in the subventricular zone (SVZ) was significantly increased after stroke. Forced limb-use enhanced the proliferation of newborn neurons in the SVZ, as well as increased the long-term survival of newborn neurons. Furthermore, forced limb-use suppressed apoptosis and improved the motor functions after stroke in the aged rats. Forced limb-use exerted few effects on inflammation. Neither the number nor dendritic complexity of newborn granule cells in the hippocampus was affected by forced limb-use. Forced limb-use is effective in enhancing neurogenesis and behavioral recovery after stroke even in the aged rats.

AB  - Abstract
Mice lacking the homeodomain transcription factor Engrailed-2 (En2−/− mice) are a well-characterized model for autism spectrum disorders (ASD). En2−/− mice present molecular, neuropathological and behavioral deficits related to ASD, including down-regulation of ASD-associated genes, cerebellar hypoplasia, interneuron loss, enhanced seizure susceptibility, decreased sociability and impaired cognition. Specifically, impaired spatial learning in the Morris water maze (MWM) is associated with reduced expression of neurofibromin and increased phosphorylation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) in the hippocampus of En2−/− adult mice. In the attempt to better understand the molecular cascades underlying neurofibromin-dependent cognitive deficits in En2 mutant mice, we investigated the expression and phosphorylation of synapsin I (SynI; a major target of neurofibromin-dependent signaling) in the hippocampus of wild-type (WT) and En2−/− mice before and after MWM. Here we show that SynI mRNA and protein levels are down-regulated in the hippocampus of naïve and MWM-treated En2−/− mice, as compared to WT controls. This down-regulation is paralleled by reduced levels of SynI phosphorylation at Ser549 and Ser553 residues in the hilus of mutant mice, before and after MWM. These data indicate that in En2−/− hippocampus, neurofibromin-dependent pathways converging on SynI phosphorylation might underlie hippocampal-dependent learning deficits observed in En2−/− mice.

AB  - Abstract
Methamphetamine exposure reduces hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and neurogenesis and these alterations partially contribute to hippocampal maladaptive plasticity. The potential mechanisms underlying methamphetamine-induced maladaptive plasticity were identified in the present study. Expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF; a regulator of LTP and neurogenesis), and its receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) were studied in the dorsal and ventral hippocampal tissue lysates in rats that intravenously self-administered methamphetamine in a limited access (1 h/day) or extended access (6 h/day) paradigm for 17 days post baseline sessions. Extended access methamphetamine enhanced expression of BDNF with significant effects observed in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Methamphetamine-induced enhancements in BDNF expression were not associated with TrkB receptor activation as indicated by phospho (p)-TrkB-706 levels. Conversely, methamphetamine produced hypophosphorylation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit 2B (GluN2B) at Tyr-1472 in the ventral hippocampus, indicating reduced receptor activation. In addition, methamphetamine enhanced expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and reduced pro-apoptotic protein Bax levels in the ventral hippocampus, suggesting a mechanism for reducing cell death. Analysis of Akt, a pro-survival kinase that suppresses apoptotic pathways and pAkt at Ser-473 demonstrated that extended access methamphetamine reduces Akt expression in the ventral hippocampus. These data reveal that alterations in Bcl-2 and Bax levels by methamphetamine were not associated with enhanced Akt expression. Given that hippocampal function and neurogenesis vary in a subregion-specific fashion, where dorsal hippocampus regulates spatial processing and has higher levels of neurogenesis, whereas ventral hippocampus regulates anxiety-related behaviors, these data suggest that methamphetamine self-administration initiates distinct allostatic changes in hippocampal subregions that may contribute to the altered synaptic activity in the hippocampus, which may underlie enhanced negative affective symptoms and perpetuation of the addiction cycle.

AB  - Abstract
Prenatal protein malnutrition (PPM) in rats causes enduring changes in brain and behavior including increased cognitive rigidity and decreased inhibitory control. A preliminary gene microarray screen of PPM rat prefrontal cortex (PFC) identified alterations in KCNJ3 (GIRK1/Kir3.1), a gene important for regulating neuronal excitability. Follow-up with polymerase chain reaction and Western blot showed decreased KCNJ3 expression in the PFC, but not hippocampus or brainstem. To verify localization of the effect to the PFC, baseline regional brain activity was assessed with 14C-2-deoxyglucose. Results showed decreased activation in the PFC but not hippocampus. Together these findings point to the unique vulnerability of the PFC to the nutritional insult during early brain development, with enduring effects in adulthood on KCNJ3 expression and baseline metabolic activity.

AB  - Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is second only to Alzheimer’s disease as the most common devastating human neurodegenerative disorder. Despite intense investigation, no curative therapy is available for PD. Paeoniflorin, a monoterpene glucoside isolated from the Paeonia lactiflora Pall., possesses wide pharmacological effects in the nervous system. This study aims at evaluating the effect of paeoniflorin on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced apoptosis and to characterize involved signal transduction pathways in PC12 cells. Our results showed that paeoniflorin suppresses mitochondria-mediated apoptosis of PC12 cells induced by 6-OHDA, and anti-apoptotic effects of paeoniflorin on PC12 cells might mainly result from its antioxidant capability by increasing glutathione (GSH). Moreover, we also found that paeoniflorin can dramatically attenuate the 6-OHDA-induced nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) translocation without affecting phosphorylation of Akt, JNK, p38, and ERK1/2. 6-OHDA-induced protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) upregulation was blocked by paeoniflorin treatment in PC12 cells. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium or NF-κB inhibitor BAY 11-7082 could partially attenuate 6-OHDA-induced cell death. Together, our results indicate that the inhibition of PC12 cell apoptosis by paeoniflorin might be mediated, at least in part, by inhibiting reactive oxygen species (ROS)/PKCδ/NF-κB signaling pathway. This evidence supports the pharmacological potential of paeoniflorin in the management of neurodegenerative disorders associated with oxidative stress, including PD.

AB  - Abstract
There is increasing evidence implicating astrocytes in multiple forms of chronic pain, as well as in the specific context of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). However, it is still unclear what the exact role of astrocytes may be in the context of CIPN. Findings in oxaliplatin and paclitaxel models have displayed altered expression of astrocytic gap junctions and glutamate transporters as means by which astrocytes may contribute to observed behavioral changes. The current study investigated whether these changes were also generalizable to the bortezomib CIPN. Changes in mechanical sensitivity were verified in bortezomib-treated animals, and these changes were prevented by co-treatment with a glial activation inhibitor (minocycline), a gap junction decoupler (carbenoxolone), and by a glutamate transporter upregulator (ceftriaxone). Immunohistochemistry data at day 30 in bortezomib-treated animals showed increases in expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and connexin 43 but a decrease in GLAST expression. These changes were prevented by co-treatment with minocycline. Follow-up Western blotting data showed a shift in connexin 43 from a non-phosphorylated state to a phosphorylated state, indicating increased trafficking of expressed connexin 43 to the cell membrane. These data suggest that increases in behavioral sensitivity to cutaneous stimuli may be tied to persistent synaptic glutamate resulting from increased calcium flow between spinal astrocytes.

AB  - Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a number of behavioral and social features. Although the etiology of most cases of ASD is idiopathic, a significant number of cases can be attributed to genetic causes, such as chromosome 15q duplications [dup(15q)]. Recent neuropathological investigations have provided evidence for distinct patterns of heterotopias and dysplasias in ASD and subjects with both ASD and dup(15q). Individuals with ASD characteristically have hearing difficulties and we have previously demonstrated significant and consistent hypoplasia in a number of auditory brainstem nuclei in subjects with ASD. Herein, we compare results from a morphometric investigation of auditory brainstem nuclei in subjects with ASD, dup(15q) and controls. Our observations in subjects with ASD support our previous reports. However, in subjects with dup(15q), we find significantly fewer neurons and in many nuclei, neurons were significantly smaller than in ASD subjects. Finally, we find a notably higher incidence of ectopic neurons in dup(15q). These results suggest that in the brainstem, these neuropathological conditions may evolve from some of the same developmental errors but are distinguished on microscopic features.

AB  - Abstract
We tested the hypothesis that chronic pain development (pain chronification) and ongoing chronic pain (chronic pain) reduce the activity and induce plastic changes in an endogenous analgesia circuit, the ascending nociceptive control. An important mechanism mediating this form of endogenous analgesia, referred to as capsaicin-induced analgesia, is its dependence on nucleus accumbens μ-opioid receptor mechanisms. Therefore, we also investigated whether pain chronification and chronic pain alter the requirement for nucleus accumbens μ-opioid receptor mechanisms in capsaicin-induced analgesia. We used an animal model of pain chronification in which daily subcutaneous prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) injections into the rat’s hind paw for 14 days, referred to as the induction period of persistent hyperalgesia, induce a long-lasting state of nociceptor sensitization referred to as the maintenance period of persistent hyperalgesia, that lasts for at least 30 days following the cessation of the PGE2 treatment. The nociceptor hypersensitivity was measured by the shortening of the time interval for the animal to respond to a mechanical stimulation of the hind paw. We found a significant reduction in the duration of capsaicin-induced analgesia during the induction and maintenance period of persistent mechanical hyperalgesia. Intra-accumbens injection of the μ-opioid receptor selective antagonist Cys2,Tyr3,Orn5,Pen7amide (CTOP) 10 min before the subcutaneous injection of capsaicin into the rat’s fore paw blocked capsaicin-induced analgesia. Taken together, these findings indicate that pain chronification and chronic pain reduce the duration of capsaicin-induced analgesia, without affecting its dependence on nucleus accumbens μ-opioid receptor mechanisms. The attenuation of endogenous analgesia during pain chronification and chronic pain suggests that endogenous pain circuits play an important role in the development and maintenance of chronic pain.

AB  - Abstract
Liposomes are nanosystems that allow a sustained release of entrapped substances. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the most prevalent inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system (CNS). We developed a liposomal formulation of GABA for application in long-term CNS functional studies. Two days after liposome-entrapped GABA was injected intracerebroventricularly (ICV), Wistar rats were submitted to the following evaluations: (1) changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) to ICV injection of bicuculline methiodide (BMI) in anesthetized rats; (2) changes in cardiovascular reactivity to air jet stress in conscious rats; and (3) anxiety-like behavior in conscious rats. GABA and saline-containing pegylated liposomes were prepared with a mean diameter of 200 nm. Rats with implanted cannulas targeted to lateral cerebral ventricle (n = 5–8/group) received either GABA solution (GS), empty liposomes (EL) or GABA-containing liposomes (GL). Following (48 h) central microinjection (2 μL, 0.09 M and 99 g/L) of liposomes, animals were submitted to the different protocols. Animals that received GL demonstrated attenuated response of RSNA to BMI microinjection (GS 48 ± 9, EL 43 ± 9, GL 11 ± 8%; P &lt; 0.05), blunted tachycardia in the stress trial (ΔHR: GS 115 ± 14, EL 117 ± 10, GL 74 ± 9 bpm; P &lt; 0.05) and spent more time in the open arms of elevated plus maze (EL 6 ± 2 vs. GL 18 ± 5%; P = 0.028) compared with GS and EL groups. These results indicate that liposome-entrapped GABA can be a potential tool for exploring the chronic effects of GABA in specific regions and pathways of the central nervous system.

AB  - Abstract
Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes mellitus, and a significant proportion of individuals suffer debilitating pain that significantly affects their quality of life. Unfortunately, symptomatic treatment options have limited efficacy, and often carry significant risk of systemic adverse effects. Activation of the adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) by the analgesic small molecule adenosine has been shown to have antinociceptive benefits in models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. The current study used a mouse model of painful diabetic neuropathy to determine the effect of diabetes on endogenous adenosine production, and if central or peripheral delivery of adenosine receptor agonists could alleviate signs of mechanical allodynia in diabetic mice. Diabetes was induced using streptozocin in male A/J mice. Mechanical withdrawal thresholds were measured weekly to characterize neuropathy phenotype. Hydrolysis of AMP into adenosine by ectonucleotidases was determined in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal cord at 8 weeks post-induction of diabetes. AMP, adenosine and the specific A1R agonist, N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA), were administered both centrally (intrathecal) and peripherally (intraplantar) to determine the effect of activation of adenosine receptors on mechanical allodynia in diabetic mice. Eight weeks post-induction, diabetic mice displayed significantly decreased hydrolysis of extracellular AMP in the DRG; at this same time, diabetic mice displayed significantly decreased mechanical withdrawal thresholds compared to nondiabetic controls. Central delivery AMP, adenosine and CPA significantly improved mechanical withdrawal thresholds in diabetic mice. Surprisingly, peripheral delivery of CPA also improved mechanical allodynia in diabetic mice. This study provides new evidence that diabetes significantly affects endogenous AMP hydrolysis, suggesting that altered adenosine production could contribute to the development of painful diabetic neuropathy. Moreover, central and peripheral activation of A1R significantly improved mechanical sensitivity, warranting further investigation into this important antinociceptive pathway as a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy.

AB  - Abstract
The protective effects of taurine against closed head injury (CHI) have been reported. This study was designed to investigate whether taurine reduced white matter damage and hippocampal neuronal death through suppressing calpain activation after CHI in rats. Taurine (50 mg/kg) was administered intravenously 30 min and 4 h again after CHI. It was found that taurine lessened the corpus callosum damage, attenuated the neuronal cell death in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 subfields and improved the neurological functions 7 days after CHI. Moreover, it suppressed the over-activation of calpain, enhanced the levels of calpastatin, and reduced the degradation of neurofilament heavy protein, myelin basic protein and αII-spectrin in traumatic tissue 24 h after CHI. These data confirm the protective effects of taurine against gray and white matter damage due to CHI, and suggest that down-regulating calpain activation could be one of the protective mechanisms of taurine against CHI.

AB  - Abstract
Pathophysiological conditions such as cerebral ischemia trigger the production of new neurons from the neurogenic niche within the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus. The functional significance of ischemia-induced neurogenesis is believed to be the regeneration of lost cells, thus contributing to post-ischemia recovery. However, the cell signaling mechanisms by which this process is regulated are still under investigation. Here, we investigated the role of mitogen and stress-activated protein kinases (MSK1/2) in the regulation of progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis after cerebral ischemia. Using the endothelin-1 model of ischemia, wild-type (WT) and MSK1−/−/MSK2−/− (MSK dKO) mice were injected with BrdU and sacrificed 2 days, 4 weeks, or 6 weeks later for the analysis of progenitor cell proliferation, neurogenesis, and neuronal morphology, respectively. We report a decrease in SGZ progenitor cell proliferation in MSK dKO mice compared to WT mice. Moreover, MSK dKO mice exhibited reduced neurogenesis and a delayed maturation of ischemia-induced newborn neurons. Further, structural analysis of neuronal arborization revealed reduced branching complexity in MSK dKO compared to WT mice. Taken together, this dataset suggests that MSK1/2 plays a significant role in the regulation of ischemia-induced progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis. Ultimately, revealing the cell signaling mechanisms that promote neuronal recovery will lead to novel pharmacological approaches for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as cerebral ischemia.

AB  - Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by alterations of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurotransmission. Compared to the wealth of data on the impairment of the dopamine system, relatively limited evidence is available concerning the role of major non-dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems in PD.

Therefore, we comprehensively investigated the density and distribution of neurotransmitter receptors for glutamate, GABA, acetylcholine, adrenaline, serotonin, dopamine and adenosine in brains of homozygous aphakia mice being characterized by mutations affecting the Pitx3 gene. This genetic model exhibits crucial hallmarks of PD on the neuropathological, symptomatic and pharmacological level. Quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to characterize 19 different receptor binding sites in eleven brain regions in order to understand receptor changes on a systemic level.

We demonstrated striking differential changes of neurotransmitter receptor densities for numerous receptor types and brain regions, respectively. Most prominent, a strong up-regulation of GABA receptors and associated benzodiazepine binding sites in different brain regions and concomitant down-regulations of striatal nicotinic acetylcholine and serotonergic receptor densities were found. Furthermore, the densities of glutamatergic kainate, muscarinic acetylcholine, adrenergic α1 and dopaminergic D2/D3 receptors were differentially altered.

These results present novel insights into the expression of neurotransmitter receptors in Pitx3ak mice supporting findings on PD pathology in patients and indicating on the possible underlying mechanisms. The data suggest Pitx3ak mice as an appropriate new model to investigate the role of neurotransmitter receptors in PD. Our study highlights the relevance of non-dopaminergic systems in PD and for the understanding of its molecular pathology.

AB  - Abstract
The transcription factor Otx1 is specifically expressed in layer V pyramidal cells (L5PCs) in the cerebral cortex. Otx1 null mutant mice have a defect in the developmental axon pruning of L5PCs and show epileptic seizures. However, the role of Otx1 in electrophysiology, morphology and synaptology of the cortical neurons has not been fully investigated. This study examines the influences of Otx1 on neuronal properties of L5PCs by loss- and gain-of-function approaches. Mice with an Otx1-null mutation had decreased structural measurements of basal dendrites in L5PCs. In contrast, the size of basal dendrites was increased in the Otx1-over-expressed pyramidal cells (PCs) in L2/3 where the gene normally does not express. PCs showed burst and non-burst firing patterns of action potentials. The proportion of burst firing neurons was reduced in the Otx1 mutant but increased in the neurons over-expressing Otx1. Although the burst firing population decreased, the proportion of those bursting neurons with a low threshold increased in the Otx1 mutant mice. Moreover, excitatory facilitating synaptic connections formed between L5PCs were predominant in the Otx1 mutant mice, which greatly contrasted with the predominant depressing synaptic connections in the controls. Taken together, it suggests an enhanced activity of neuronal network in the cortex of Otx1 mutant mice. These data indicate that the Otx1 expression is essential for the normal development of dendritic morphology, intrinsic electrophysiology and synaptic dynamics of L5PCs. This study provides new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal regulation of neuronal and synaptic properties of L5PCs, and improves our understanding on the generation of epileptic seizures.

AB  - Abstract
We previously demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide concentration ([H2O2]) significantly increases after spinal cord injury (SCI). The present study explored (1) whether SCI-elevated [H2O2] is sufficient to induce oxidation and cell death, (2) if apoptosis is a pathway of H2O2-induced cell death, and (3) whether H2O2-induced oxidation and cell death could be reversed by treatment with the catalytic antioxidant Mn (III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (MnTBAP). H2O2 was perfused through a microcannula into the uninjured rat spinal cord to mimic the conditions induced by SCI. Protein and DNA oxidation, membrane phospholipids peroxidation (MLP), cell death and apoptosis were characterized by histochemical and immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against markers of oxidation and apoptosis. Stained cells were quantified in sections of H2O2-, or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF)-exposed with vehicle-, or MnTBAP-treated groups. Compared with ACSF-exposed animals, SCI-elevated [H2O2] significantly increased intracellular protein and DNA oxidation by threefold and MLP by eightfold in neurons, respectively. H2O2-elevated extracellular malondialdehyde was measured by microdialysis sampling. We demonstrated that SCI-elevated [H2O2] significantly increased extracellular malondialdehyde above pre-injury levels. H2O2 also significantly increased cell loss and the numbers of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-(dUTP)-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive and active caspase-3-positive neurons by 2.3-, 2.8-, and 5.6-fold compared to ACSF controls, respectively. Our results directly and unequivocally demonstrate that SCI-elevated [H2O2] contributes to post-SCI MLP, protein, and DNA oxidation to induce cell death. Therefore, we conclude that (1) the role of H2O2 in secondary SCI is pro-oxidation and pro-cell death, (2) apoptosis is a pathway for SCI-elevated [H2O2] to induce cell death, (3) caspase activation is a mechanism of H2O2-induced apoptosis after SCI, and (4) MnTBAP treatment significantly decreased H2O2-induced oxidation, cell loss, and apoptosis to the levels of ACSF controls, further supporting MnTBAP’s ability to scavenge H2O2 by in vivo evidence.

AB  - Abstract
Gap junctions provide for direct intercellular electrical and metabolic coupling. The abundance of gap junctions at “large myelinated club ending (LMCE)” synapses on Mauthner cells (M-cells) of the teleost brain provided a convenient model to correlate anatomical and physiological properties of electrical synapses. There, presynaptic action potentials were found to evoke short-latency electrical “pre-potentials” immediately preceding their accompanying glutamate-induced depolarizations, making these the first unambiguously identified “mixed” (i.e., chemical plus electrical) synapses in the vertebrate CNS. We recently showed that gap junctions at these synapses exhibit asymmetric electrical resistance (i.e., electrical rectification), which we correlated with total molecular asymmetry of connexin composition in their apposing gap junction hemiplaques, with connexin35 (Cx35) restricted to axon terminal hemiplaques and connexin34.7 (Cx34.7) restricted to apposing M-cell plasma membranes. We now show that similarly heterotypic neuronal gap junctions are abundant throughout goldfish brain, with labeling exclusively for Cx35 in presynaptic hemiplaques and exclusively for Cx34.7 in postsynaptic hemiplaques. Moreover, the vast majority of these asymmetric gap junctions occur at glutamatergic axon terminals. The widespread distribution of heterotypic gap junctions at glutamatergic mixed synapses throughout goldfish brain and spinal cord implies that pre- vs. postsynaptic asymmetry at electrical synapses evolved early in the chordate lineage. We propose that the advantages of the molecular and functional asymmetry of connexins at electrical synapses that are so prominently expressed in the teleost CNS are unlikely to have been abandoned in higher vertebrates. However, to create asymmetric coupling in mammals, where most gap junctions are composed of connexin36 (Cx36) on both sides, would require some other mechanism, such as differential phosphorylation of connexins on opposite sides of the same gap junction or on asymmetric differences in the complement of their scaffolding and regulatory proteins.

AB  - Abstract
In patients suffering from stress-related pathologies and depression, frontal cortex GABA and glutamate contents are reported to decrease and increase, respectively. This suggests that the GABA and/or glutamate content may participate in pathological phenotype expression. Whether differences in frontal cortex GABA and glutamate contents would be associated with specific behavioral and neurobiological patterns remains unclear, especially in the event of exposure to moderate stress. We hypothesized that an increase in prefrontal cortex GABA/glutamate ratio would be associated with a blunted prefrontal cortex activation, an enhanced hypothalamo-pituitary–adrenocortical (HPA) axis activation and changes in behavior. Rats being restrained for 1-h were then tested in an open-field test in order to assess their behavior while under stress, and were sacrificed immediately afterward. The GABA/glutamate ratio was assessed by 1H high-resolution magic angle spinning magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-HRMAS-MRS). The neurobiological response was evaluated through prefrontal cortex mRNA expression and plasma corticosterone levels. The stressed rats were distributed into two subgroups according to their high (H-G/g) or low (L-G/g) GABA/glutamate ratio. Compared to the L-G/g rats, the H-G/g rats exhibited a decrease in c-fos, Arc, Npas4, Nr4a2 mRNA expression suggesting blunted prefrontal cortex activation. They also showed a more pronounced stress with an enhanced rise in corticosterone, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, as well as behavioral disturbances with decreased locomotion speed. These changes were independent from prefrontal cortex energetic status as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway activities were similar in both subpopulations. The differences in GABA/glutamate ratio in the frontal cortex observed in the stressed animals may participate in shaping individual differences in psychophysiological reactions.

AB  - Abstract
Aquaporin 1 (AQP1) is a member of a family of small, integral membrane water-transporting proteins, which facilitate water movement across cell membranes in response to osmotic gradients. Several papers have studied the expression and function of the AQPs in the central nervous system. However, little is known about the AQPs in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). In the PNS, AQP1, AQP2 and AQP4 have been reported in both peripheral neurons and glial cells. In this work we studied the expression and localization of AQP1 in the rat sciatic nerve. We found that from the four AQPs we studied (AQP1, AQP2, AQP4 and AQP9) only AQP1 is expressed in the nerve by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). AQP1 is also observed at the protein level by Western blot analysis. We also studied the localization of AQP1 in the sciatic nerve by immunohistochemistry. The results show that AQP1 is present in both myelinating and non-myelinating Schwann cells. In myelin internodes AQP1 is enriched in the Schmidt–Lanterman incisures and in some internodes it is also present in the abaxonal membrane. At the nodes of Ranvier, AQP1 co-localizes with actin in the paranodal regions of the nerve. Therefore, AQP1 might play an important role in myelin homeostasis maintaining the thermodynamic equilibrium across the plasma membrane in myelinated axons during electrical activity. Also the expression of AQP1 in non-myelinating Schwann cells supports the involvement of AQP1 in pain perception.

AB  - Abstract
Perceptual filters formed early in development provide an initial means of parsing the incoming auditory stream. However, these filters may not remain fixed, and may be updated by subsequent auditory input, such that, even in an adult organism, the auditory system undergoes plastic changes to achieve a more efficient representation of the recent auditory environment. Songbirds are an excellent model system for experimental studies of auditory phenomena due to many parallels between song learning in birds and language acquisition in humans. In the present study, we explored the effects of passive immersion in a novel heterospecific auditory environment on neural responses in caudo-medial neostriatum (NCM), a songbird auditory area similar to the secondary auditory cortex in mammals. In zebra finches, a well-studied species of songbirds, NCM responds selectively to conspecific songs and contains a neuronal memory for tutor and other familiar conspecific songs. Adult male zebra finches were randomly assigned to either a conspecific or heterospecific auditory environment. After 2, 4 or 9 days of exposure, subjects were presented with heterospecific and conspecific songs during awake electrophysiological recording. The neural response strength and rate of adaptation to the testing stimuli were recorded bilaterally. Controls exposed to conspecific environment sounds exhibited the normal pattern of hemispheric lateralization with higher absolute response strength and faster adaptation in the right hemisphere. The pattern of lateralization was fully reversed in birds exposed to heterospecific environment for 4 or 9 days and partially reversed in birds exposed to heterospecific environment for 2 days. Our results show that brief passive exposure to a novel category of sounds was sufficient to induce a gradual reorganization of the left and right secondary auditory cortices. These changes may reflect modification of perceptual filters to form a more efficient representation of auditory space.

AB  - Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the major causes of death and disability in pediatrics, and results in a complex cascade of events including the disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB). A controlled-cortical impact on post-natal 17-day-old rats induced BBB disruption by IgG extravasation from 1 to 3 days after injury and returned to normal at day 7. In parallel, we characterized the expression of three caveolin isoforms, caveolin 1 (cav-1), caveolin 2 (cav-2) and caveolin 3 (cav-3). While cav-1 and cav-2 are expressed on endothelial cells, both cav-1 and cav-3 were found to be present on reactive astrocytes, in vivo and in vitro. Following TBI, cav-1 expression was increased in blood vessels at 1 and 7 days in the perilesional cortex. An increase of vascular cav-2 expression was observed 7 days after TBI. In contrast, astrocytic cav-3 expression decreased 3 and 7 days after TBI. Activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) (via its phosphorylation) was detected 1 day after TBI and phospho-eNOS was detected both in association with blood vessels and with astrocytes. The molecular changes involving caveolins occurring in endothelial cells following juvenile-TBI might participate, independently of eNOS activation, to a mechanism of BBB repair while, they might subserve other undefined roles in astrocytes.

AB  - Abstract
The timing of thyroxine (T4) replacement treatment in congenital hypothyroidism (CH) has been suggested to be important for optimizing cognitive recovery in humans; however this has not been fully established using modern animal models of CH. Consequently, the current studies investigated the ameliorating effects of postnatal T4 treatment on neuropathology and behavior in CH rats. Rat dams were administered methimazole to produce CH offspring, then brain tissue from male CH pups was analyzed to determine the effects of postnatal (P3, P7, P14 and P21) T4 treatment on hippocampal dendritic branching and the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF). Two operant behavioral procedures were employed to confirm and extend previous findings obtained using this model, and to investigate timelines for instigating T4 treatment on improved behavioral outcomes. T4 treatment initiated at P14 was protective of a reduction in dendritic branching in the hippocampus, and initiated at P7 was protective of a reduction of NGF expression in the fimbria of the hippocampus. Induction of CH did not affect the acquisition of simple operant response rules but had a significant effect on the acquisition of complex operant rules subsequently imposed. Furthermore, T4 treatment initiated at P3 protected learning deficits seen following the imposition of complex operant response rules. These findings indicate T4 treatment initiated at P7 is sufficient for the protection of hippocampal NGF expression and dendritic branching but for the protection of complex behavioral abilities T4 treatment is necessary prior to or approximating P3.

AB  - Abstract
N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDA-Rs) are located at each synapse in the lower auditory pathway of mammals and avians. Characterized by a slow and long-lasting excitatory response upon glutamate activation, their existence in a sensory system biologically engineered for speed and precision seems counterintuitive. In this review we consider the diverse functions of NMDA-Rs. Their developmental regulation and unique subunit composition in the inner ear promote protective and neurotrophic roles following acute insult by regulating AMPA-R expression and assisting in the restoration of synaptic inputs. This contrasts with chronic damage where overactivation of NMDA-Rs is implicated in neuronal death. These functions are thought to be involved in auditory diseases, including noise-induced hearing loss, neural presbycusis, and tinnitus via aberrant excitation. A more traditional role emerges in the developing auditory brainstem, where NMDA-Rs are downregulated and switch subunit composition with maturation. Their biophysical properties also contribute to synaptic dynamics resembling long-term plasticity. At mature synapses they support reliable auditory processing by increasing the probability of action potential generation, regulating first-spike latency, and maintaining reliable action potential firing. Thus, NMDA-R functions in the lower auditory pathway are diverse, contributing to synaptic development, plasticity, temporal processing, and diseases.

AB  - Abstract
The transition from sleep to the awake state is regulated by the activation of subcortical nuclei of the brainstem (BS) and basal forebrain (BF), releasing acetylcholine and glutamate throughout the cortex and inducing a tonic state of neural activity. It has been suggested that such activation is also mediated by the massive and diffuse cortical release of nitric oxide (NO). In this work we have combined the spectroscopic measurement of NO levels in the somatosensory cortex of the cat through its marker methemoglobin, as well as two other hemodynamic markers (oxyhemoglobin – oxyHb – and deoxyhemoglobin – deoxyHb), together with the electrical stimulation of BS and BF – to induce an experimental transition from a sleep-like state to an awake-like mode. The results show an increase of NO levels either after BS or BF activation. The response induced by BS stimulation was biphasic in the three studied markers, and lasted for up to 30 s. The changes induced by BF were monophasic lasting for up to 20 s. The systemic blockade of NO production abolished the observed responses to BS whereas responses to BF stimulation were much less affected. These results indicate a crucial role for NO in the neuronal activation induced by the ascending systems.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic stress, the administration of glucocorticoids and the prolonged activation of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) are reported to induce affective changes in humans and rodents that resemble a depressive state. However, data concerning the behavioral and molecular effects of the selective activation of specific GRs are limited, and the conclusions derived remain debatable. In this study, our goal was to investigate the behavioral and molecular changes following the prolonged activation of GRs in mice via exposure to the specific agonist dexamethasone (DEX). C57BL/6J mice were injected daily with DEX (4 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline, and the behavior of the animals was assessed in the following paradigms: the forced swimming test (FST), the light–dark box test, the saccharin preference test and activity boxes. The mRNA expression levels of the corticosteroid receptors mineralocorticoid (MR, Nr3c2) and glucocorticoid (GR, Nr3c1), selected stress dependent genes and glial markers were analyzed in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum. DEX-treated mice exhibited a variety of depression-like behaviors: increased time of immobility in the FST, a reduced preference for saccharin consumption and increased anxiety-like behavior. Behavioral alterations were accompanied by a decrease in the mRNA expression of GR and the increased expression of Fkbp5 and Sgk1 in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum of DEX-treated mice. Furthermore, our results indicate a decrease in the mRNA expression of glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST, Slc1a3), an astroglial cell marker, in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. These results demonstrate that the prolonged activation of GR receptors induced a depression-like state in mice, activated stress-related genes and induced a decrease in the mRNA expression of GLAST, an astroglial marker, in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Together, the results reported here challenge several hypotheses concerning the role of GRs in the development of behavioral and molecular alterations relevant to stress-related disorders, such as depression, under the same experimental conditions.

Despite significant advances, the neural correlates and neurochemical mechanisms involved in performance monitoring and behavioral adaptation are still a matter for debate.

Here, we used a modified Eriksen–Flanker task in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study that required the participants to derive the correct stimulus–response association based on a feedback given after each flanker stimulus. Participants had to continuously monitor and adapt their performance as the stimulus–response association switched after a jittered time interval without notice.

After every switch an increase of reaction times was observed. At the neural level, the feedback indicating the need to switch was associated with activation of the precuneus, the cingulate cortex, the insula and a brainstem region tentatively identified as the locus coeruleus. This brainstem system appears to interact with this cortical network and seems to be essential for performance monitoring and behavioral adaptation. In contrast, the cerebellum crus and prefrontal areas are activated during error feedback processing. Furthermore we found activations of the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus bilaterally after a correct feedback in learnable stimulus–response associations.

These results highlight the contribution of brainstem nuclei to performance adaptation.

AB  - Abstract
ATP, via activation of P2X3 receptors, has been highlighted as a key target in inflammatory hyperalgesia. Therefore, the aim of this study was to confirm whether the activation of P2X3 receptors in the gastrocnemius muscle of rats induces mechanical muscle hyperalgesia and, if so, to analyze the involvement of the classical inflammatory mediators (bradykinin, prostaglandins, sympathetic amines, pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil migration) in this response. Intramuscular administration of the non-selective P2X3 receptor agonist α,β-meATP in the gastrocnemius muscle of rats induced mechanical muscle hyperalgesia, which, in turn, was prevented by the selective P2X3 and P2X2/3 receptors antagonist A-317491, the selective bradykinin B1-receptor antagonist Des-Arg9-[Leu8]-BK (DALBK), the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, the β1- or β2-adrenoceptor antagonist atenolol and ICI 118,551, respectively. Also, the nonspecific selectin inhibitor fucoidan. α,β-meATP induced increases in the local concentration of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β), which were reduced by bradykinin antagonist. Finally, α,β-meATP also induced neutrophil migration. Together, these findings suggest that α,β-meATP induced mechanical hyperalgesia in the gastrocnemius muscle of rats via activation of peripheral P2X3 receptors, which involves bradykinin, prostaglandins, sympathetic amines, pro-inflammatory cytokines release and neutrophil migration. It is also indicated that bradykinin is the key modulator of the mechanical muscle hyperalgesia induced by P2X3 receptors. Therefore, we suggest that P2X3 receptors are important targets to control muscle inflammatory pain.

AB  - Abstract
The thalamus is a critical node for several pathways involved in learning and memory. Damage to the thalamus by trauma, disease or malnourishment can impact the effectiveness of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC) and lead to a profound amnesia state. Using the pyrithiamine-induced thiamine deficiency (PTD) rat model of human Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, we tested the hypothesis that co-infusion of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine across the PFC and HPC would recover spatial alternation performance in PTD rats. When cholinergic tone was increased by dual injections across the PFC–HPC, spontaneous alternation performance in PTD rats was recovered. In addition, we tested a second hypothesis that two ventral midline thalamic nuclei, the rhomboid nucleus and nucleus reuniens (Rh–Re), form a critical node needed for the recovery of function observed when cholinergic tone was increased across the PFC and HPC. By using the GABAA agonist muscimol to temporarily deactivate the Rh–Re the recovery of alternation behavior obtained in the PTD model by cholinergic stimulation across the PFC–HPC was blocked. In control pair-fed (PF) rats, inactivation of the Rh–Re impaired spontaneous alternation. However, when inactivation of the Rh–Re co-occurred with physostigmine infusions across the PFC–HPC, PF rats had normal performance. These results further demonstrate that the Rh–Re is critical in facilitating interactions between the HPC and PFC, but other redundant pathways also exist.

AB  - Abstract
The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is involved in a considerable number of physiological processes in the Central Nervous System. Recently, a modulatory role of cannabinoid receptors (CBr) and CBr agonists on the reduction of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) activation has been demonstrated. Quinolinic acid (QUIN), an endogenous analog of glutamate and excitotoxic metabolite produced in the kynurenine pathway (KP), selectively activates NMDAr and has been shown to participate in different neurodegenerative disorders. Since the early pattern of toxicity exerted by this metabolite is relevant to explain the extent of damage that it can produce in the brain, in this work we investigated the effects of the synthetic CBr agonist WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) and other agonists (anandamide or AEA, and CP 55,940 or CP) on early markers of QUIN-induced toxicity in rat striatal cultured cells and rat brain synaptosomes. WIN, AEA and CP exerted protective effects on the QUIN-induced loss of cell viability. WIN also preserved the immunofluorescent signals for neurons and CBr labeling that were decreased by QUIN. The QUIN-induced early mitochondrial dysfunction, lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation were also partially or completely prevented by WIN pretreatment, but not when this CBr agonist was added simultaneously with QUIN to brain synaptosomes. These findings support a neuroprotective and modulatory role of cannabinoids in the early toxic events elicited by agents inducing excitotoxic processes.

AB  - Abstract
The dopamine D1 and D2 receptors form the D1-D2 receptor heteromer in a subset of neurons and couple to the Gq protein to regulate intracellular calcium signaling. In the present study the effect of D1-D2 heteromer activation and disruption on neuronal activation in the rat brain was mapped. This was accomplished using the dopamine agonist SKF 83959 to activate the D1-D2 heteromer in combination with a TAT-D1 disrupting peptide we developed, and which has been shown to disrupt the D1/D2 receptor interaction and antagonize D1-D2 heteromer-induced cell signaling and behavior. Acute SKF 83959 administration to rats induced significant c-fos expression in the nucleus accumbens that was significantly inhibited by TAT-D1 pretreatment. No effects of SKF 83959 were seen in caudate putamen. D1-D2 heteromer disruption by TAT-D1 did not have any effects in any striatal subregions, but induced significant c-fos immunoreactivity in a number of cortical regions including the orbitofrontal cortex, prelimbic and infralimbic cortices and piriform cortex. The induction of c-fos by TAT-D1 was also evident in the anterior olfactory nucleus, as well as the lateral habenula and thalamic nuclei. These findings show for the first time that the D1-D2 heteromer can differentially regulate c-fos expression in a region-dependent manner either through its activation or through tonic inhibition of neuronal activity.

AB  - Abstract
Calorie restriction (CR) increases longevity and elicits many health promoting benefits including delaying immunosenescence and reducing the incidence of age-related diseases. Although the mechanisms underlying the health-enhancing effects of CR are not known, a likely contributing factor is alterations in immune system functioning. CR suppresses lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, blocks LPS-induced fever, and shifts hypothalamic signaling pathways to an anti-inflammatory bias. Furthermore, we have recently shown that CR attenuates LPS-stimulated microglial activation in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC), a brain region containing neurons that synthesize neuropeptide Y (NPY), an orexigenic neuropeptide that is upregulated by a CR diet and has anti-inflammatory properties. To determine if increased NPY expression in the ARC following CR was associated with changes in microglial activation, a set of brain sections from mice that were exposed to 50% CR or ad libitum feeding for 28 days before being injected with LPS were immunostained for NPY. The density of NPY-immunolabeling was assessed across the rostrocaudal extent of the ARC and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). An adjacent set of sections were immunostained for ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 (Iba1) and immunostained microglia in the ARC were digitally reconstructed to investigate the effects of CR on microglial morphology. We demonstrated that exposure to CR increased NPY expression in the ARC, but not the PVN. Digital reconstruction of microglia revealed that LPS increased Iba1 intensity in ad libitum fed mice but had no effect on Iba1 intensity in CR mice. CR also decreased the size of ARC microglial cells following LPS. Correlational analyses revealed strong associations between NPY and body temperature, and body temperature and microglia area. Together these results suggest that CR-induced changes in NPY are not directly involved in the suppression of LPS-induced microglial activation, however, NPY may indirectly affect microglial morphology through changes in body temperature.

To investigate the effect of senescence on signal transmission, we have compared the visual response latency and spontaneous activity of cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), area 17, area 18 and posteromedial lateral suprasylvian area (PMLS) of young and old cats. We found that LGN cells in old cats exhibit largely normal visual response latency. In contrast, all the other three areas exhibited significant aging-related delays in the visual response latency. On average, PMLS showed most pronounced delays among these three areas. Area 18 slowed more than area 17, but this was not significant. The degradation of signal timing in the visual cortex might provide insight into neuronal response mechanism underlying perception slowing during aging.

AB  - Abstract
We have previously demonstrated that recombinant T-cell receptor ligand 1000 (RTL1000) reduces infarct size and improves long-term functional recovery after experimental stroke in young transgenic mice expressing human leukocyte antigen DR2 (DR2-Tg). In this study, we determined the effect of RTL1000 on infarct size in 12-month-old middle-aged DR2-Tg mice, and investigated its mechanism of action. Twelve-month-old male DR2-Tg mice underwent 60 min of intraluminal reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Vehicle or RTL1000 was injected 4, 24, 48 and 72 h after MCAO. Cortical, striatal and total hemispheric infarcts were measured 96 h after stroke. Spleen and brain tissues were collected 96 h after stroke for immunological analysis. Our data showed that RTL1000 significantly reduced infarct size 96 h after MCAO in middle-aged male DR2-Tg mice. RTL1000 decreased the number of activated monocytes/microglia cells (CD11b+CD45hi) and CD3+ T cells in the ischemic hemisphere. RTL1000 also reduced the percentage of total T cells and inflammatory neutrophils in the spleen. These findings suggest that RTL1000 protects against ischemic stroke in middle-aged male mice by limiting post-ischemic inflammation.

AB  - Abstract
A fundamental problem in neurophysiology is the understanding of neuronal mechanisms by which the central nervous system produces a sequence of voluntary or involuntary motor acts from a diverse repertory of movements. These kinds of transitions between motor acts are extremely complex; however, they could be analyzed in a more simple form in decerebrate animals in the context of spinal central pattern generation. Here, we present for the first time a physiological phenomenon of post-scratching locomotion in which decerebrate cats exhibit a compulsory locomotor activity after an episode of scratching. We found flexor, extensor and intermediate single interneurons rhythmically firing in the same phase during both scratching and the subsequent post-scratching locomotion. Because no changes in phase of these neurons from scratching to post-scratching locomotion were found, we suggest that in the lumbar spinal cord there are neurons associated with both motor tasks. Moreover, because of its high reproducibility we suggest that the study of post-scratching fictive locomotion, together with the unitary recording of neurons, could become a useful tool to study neuronal mechanisms underlying transitions from one rhythmic motor task to another, and to study in more detail the central pattern generator circuitry in the spinal cord.

AB  - Abstract
The entorhinal cortex and other hippocampal and parahippocampal cortices are interconnected by a small number of GABAergic nonpyramidal neurons in addition to glutamatergic pyramidal cells. Since the cortical and basolateral amygdalar nuclei have cortex-like cell types and have robust projections to the entorhinal cortex, we hypothesized that a small number of amygdalar GABAergic nonpyramidal neurons might participate in amygdalo-entorhinal projections. To test this hypothesis we combined Fluorogold (FG) retrograde tract tracing with immunohistochemistry for the amygdalar nonpyramidal cell markers glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SOM), neuropeptide Y (NPY), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and the m2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor (M2R). Injections of FG into the rat entorhinal cortex labeled numerous neurons that were mainly located in the cortical and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala. Although most of these amygdalar FG+ neurons labeled by entorhinal injections were large pyramidal cells, 1–5% were smaller long-range nonpyramidal neurons (LRNP neurons) that expressed SOM, or both SOM and NPY. No amygdalar FG+ neurons in these cases were PV+ or VIP+. Cell counts revealed that LRNP neurons labeled by injections into the entorhinal cortex constituted about 10–20% of the total SOM+ population, and 20–40% of the total NPY population in portions of the lateral amygdalar nucleus that exhibited a high density of FG+ neurons. Sixty-two percent of amygdalar FG+/SOM+ neurons were GAD+, and 51% were M2R+. Since GABAergic projection neurons typically have low perikaryal levels of GABAergic markers, it is actually possible that most or all of the amygdalar LRNP neurons are GABAergic. Like GABAergic LRNP neurons in hippocampal/parahippocampal regions, amygdalar LRNP neurons that project to the entorhinal cortex are most likely involved in synchronizing oscillatory activity between the two regions. These oscillations could entrain synchronous firing of amygdalar and entorhinal pyramidal neurons, thus facilitating functional interactions between them, including synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Abstract
Structural changes that alter hippocampal functional circuitry are implicated in learning impairments, mood disorders and epilepsy. Reorganization of mossy fiber (MF) axons from dentate granule cells is one such form of plasticity. Increased neurotrophin signaling is proposed to underlie MF plasticity, and there is evidence to support a mechanistic role for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in this process. Transgenic mice overexpressing BDNF in the forebrain under the α-calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II promoter (TgBDNF mice) exhibit spatial learning deficits at 2–3 months of age, followed by the emergence of spontaneous seizures at ∼6 months. These behavioral changes suggest that chronic increases in BDNF progressively disrupt hippocampal functional organization. To determine if the dentate MF pathway is structurally altered in this strain, the present study employed Timm staining and design-based stereology to compare MF distribution and projection volumes in transgenic and wild-type mice at 2–3 months, and at 6–7 months. Mice in the latter age group were assessed for seizure vulnerability with a low dose of pilocarpine given 2 h before euthanasia. At 2–3 months, TgBDNF mice showed moderate expansion of CA3-projecting MFs (∼20%), with increased volumes measured in the suprapyramidal (SP-MF) and intra/infrapyramidal (IIP-MF) compartments. At 6–7 months, a subset of transgenic mice exhibited increased seizure susceptibility, along with an increase in IIP-MF volume (∼30%). No evidence of MF sprouting was seen in the inner molecular layer. Additional stereological analyses demonstrated significant increases in molecular layer (ML) volume in TgBDNF mice at both ages, as well as an increase in granule cell number by 8 months of age. Collectively, these results indicate that sustained increases in endogenous BDNF modify dentate structural organization over time, and may thereby contribute to the development of pro-epileptic circuitry.

AB  - Abstract
Motor feedback usually engages distinct sensory and cognitive processes based on different feedback conditions, e.g., the real and sham feedbacks. It was thought that these processes may rely on the functional connectivity among the brain networks. However, it remains unclear whether there is a difference in the network connectivity between the two feedback conditions. To address this issue, we carried out a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study by employing a new paradigm, i.e., continuous feedback (8 min) of finger force. Using independent component analysis and functional connectivity analysis, we found that as compared with the sham feedback, the real feedback recruited stronger negative connectivity between the executive network (EN) and the posterior default mode network (pDMN). More intriguingly, the left frontal parietal network (lFPN) exhibits positive connectivity with the pDMN in the real feedback while in the sham feedback, the lFPN shows connectivity with the EN. These results suggest that the connectivity among EN, pDMN, lFPN could differ depending on the real and sham feedbacks, and the lFPN may balance the competition between the pDMN and EN, thus supporting the sensory and cognitive processes of the motor feedback.

Anesthetic doses of ketamine induce apoptosis, as well as gene expression of activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), a putative homeodomain transcription factor in rat pups (P7). This study investigated if ketamine induced ADNP protein in a dose-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo using primary cultures of cortical neurons and neonatal pups (P7). In vivo immunohistochemistry demonstrated a sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine increased ADNP in the somatosensory cortex (SCC) which was previously identified to be damaged by repeated exposure to anesthetic doses of ketamine. Administration of low-dose ketamine prior to full sedation prevented caspase-3 activation in the hippocampus and SCC. Primary cultures of cortical neurons treated with ketamine (10 μM–10 mM) at 3 days-in vitro (3 DIV) displayed a concentration-dependent decrease in expanded growth cones. Furthermore, neuronal production and localization of ADNP varied as a function of both ketamine concentration and length of exposure. Taken together, these data support the model that ADNP induction may be partially responsible for the efficacy of a low-dose ketamine pre-treatment in preventing ketamine-induced neuronal cell death.

AB  - Abstract
Necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) is an inhibitor of necroptosis, playing an important role in inhibition of pathological death in the central nervous system (CNS). Our earlier study suggests that Nec-1 protects the injured spinal cord. In this study, we found that Nec-1 reduces the elevated Ca2+ concentration in mitochondria post-injury and preserves the remarkably decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) level post-spinal cord injury (SCI). It also increases the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by promoting the activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I instead of other complexes, which are significantly decreased due to the injury. Nec-1 also inhibits the release of cytochrome c in the mitochondria and protects the spinal cord from mitochondrial swelling post-SCI. Nec-1 promotes mitochondrial biogenesis by up-regulating mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam), in accordance with the mtDNA content. It also inhibits the up-regulation of mitochondrial fusion genes Mnf1, Mnf2 within 6 h post-injury and adjusts the abnormal expression of mitochondrial fission gene Fis1. All these results indicate the improvement of mitochondrial functions in injured spinal cord after the treatment of Nec-1. This research revealed the mechanisms of functional protection of Nec-1 by mitigating mitochondrial dysfunction post-SCI.

AB  - Abstract
It has been documented that infection of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) contributes to the initiation of Bell’s palsy. However, the exact mechanisms responsible for this disorder have not been fully elucidated to date. A mouse model of facial palsy induced by HSV-1 provides an opportunity to investigate the alteration in activities of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and its consequent effect on two key inflammatory factors, i.e., tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), as well as the effect of glucocorticoids (GCs) in this work. I-kappa B (IκB)-α phosphorylation and NF-κB nuclear translocation were measured by western blotting, and NF-κB/DNA binding activity was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Results showed the IκB-α phosphorylation and degradation as well as NF-κB activation in a time-dependent manner. The expression of TNF-α and COX-2 were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), western blotting and/or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) respectively. Concomitant with the activation, the expression and secretion of TNF-α and COX-2 were rapidly induced in HSV-1-infected paralyzed mice. Conversely, the activation of NF-κB and up-regulation of TNF-α and COX-2 were blocked by pretreatment with NF-κB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) before being inoculated with HSV-1 to mice. In addition, GCs inhibited the nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of NF-κB via inhibiting IκB-α degradation. Meanwhile, TNF-α production and COX-2 expression were significantly reduced by GCs. In conclusion, HSV-1 inoculation induced the activation of NF-κB, expression and secretion of TNF-α and COX-2 in the facial paralyzed mice, while, glucocorticoid effectively down-regulated TNF-α and COX-2 expression in HSV-1-induced paralyzed mice.

AB  - Abstract
The mechanisms by which alcohol drinking promotes addiction in humans and self-administration in rodents remain obscure, but it is well known that alcohol can enhance dopamine (DA) neurotransmission from neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and increase DA levels within the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex. We recorded from identified DA neuronal cell bodies within ventral midbrain slices prepared from a transgenic mouse line (TH-GFP) using long-term stable extracellular recordings in a variety of locations and carefully mapped the responses to applied ethanol (EtOH). We identified a subset of DA neurons in the medial VTA located within the rostral linear and interfascicular nuclei that fired spontaneously and exhibited a concentration-dependent increase of firing frequency in response to EtOH, with some neurons responsive to as little as 20 mM EtOH. Many of these medial VTA DA neurons were also insensitive to the D2 receptor agonist quinpirole. In contrast, DA neurons in the lateral VTA (located within the parabrachial pigmented and paranigral nuclei) were either unresponsive or responded only to 100 mM EtOH. Typically, these lateral VTA DA cells had very slow firing rates, and all exhibited inhibition by quinpirole via D2 “autoreceptors”. VTA non-DA cells did not show any significant response to low levels of EtOH. These findings are consistent with evidence for heterogeneity among midbrain DA neurons and provide an anatomical and pharmacological distinction between DA neuron sub-populations that will facilitate future mechanistic studies on the actions of EtOH in the VTA.

AB  - Abstract
Many motor behaviors, from walking to speaking, are acquired through experience, in particular, through trial-and-error learning. The acquisition and maintenance of such motor behaviors in a wide range of species, including humans, appear to depend on cortical-basal ganglia circuits. In this review, we discuss recent studies in songbirds that have been pivotal in informing our current understanding of motor learning and cortical-basal ganglia function. Songbirds are important ethological model systems for the study of motor learning because young songbirds naturally develop and refine their songs through trial-and-error learning. In addition, reinforcement mechanisms are hypothesized to be important for the maintenance and plasticity of structured adult song. Computational and experimental studies highlight the importance of vocal motor variability as the substrate upon which reinforcement mechanisms could operate to shape developing song and to maintain adult song. Recent studies in songbirds indicate that this vocal motor variability is actively generated and modulated by a highly specialized cortical-basal ganglia circuit evolved for a single behavior, song. We argue that these and other recent findings illustrate how the tight association between a specialized neural circuit and a natural behavior make songbirds a unique and powerful model in which to investigate the neural substrates of motor learning and plasticity.

Songbirds provide a powerful animal model for investigating how the brain uses sensory feedback to correct behavioral errors. Here, we review a recent study in which we used online manipulations of auditory feedback to quantify the relationship between sensory error size, motor variability, and vocal plasticity. We found that although inducing small auditory errors evoked relatively large compensatory changes in behavior, as error size increased the magnitude of error correction declined. Furthermore, when we induced large errors such that auditory signals no longer overlapped with the baseline distribution of feedback, the magnitude of error correction approached zero. This pattern suggests a simple and robust strategy for the brain to maintain the accuracy of learned behaviors by evaluating sensory signals relative to the previously experienced distribution of feedback. Drawing from recent studies of auditory neurophysiology and song discrimination, we then speculate as to the mechanistic underpinnings of the results obtained in our behavioral experiments. Finally, we review how our own and other studies exploit the strengths of the songbird system, both in the specific context of vocal systems and more generally as a model of the neural control of complex behavior.

Human psychophysics is the quantitative measurement of our own perceptions.

In the 21st century, when hugely powerful techniques are available that enable us to probe the innermost structure and function of nervous systems, is human psychophysics still relevant? I argue that it is, and that in combination with other techniques, it will continue to be a key part of neuroscience for the foreseeable future. I discuss these points in detail using the example of binocular stereopsis, where human psychophysics in combination with physiology and computational vision, has made a substantial contribution.

AB  - Abstract
The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is ideally suited for investigating the neural circuit basis of behavior. Due to the simplicity and genetic tractability of the fly brain, neurons and circuits are identifiable across animals. Additionally, a large set of transgenic lines has been developed with the aim of specifically labeling small subsets of neurons and manipulating them in sophisticated ways. Electrophysiology and imaging can be applied in behaving individuals to examine the computations performed by each neuron, and even the entire population of relevant neurons in a particular region, because of the small size of the brain. Moreover, a rich repertoire of behaviors that can be studied is expanding to include those requiring cognitive abilities. Thus, the fly brain is an attractive system in which to explore both computations and mechanisms underlying behavior at levels spanning from genes through neurons to circuits. This review summarizes the advantages Drosophila offers in achieving this objective. A recent neurophysiology study on olfactory behavior is also introduced to demonstrate the effectiveness of these advantages.

AB  - Abstract
Selection of a model organism creates tension between competing constraints. The recent explosion of modern molecular techniques has revolutionized the analysis of neural systems in organisms that are amenable to genetic techniques. Yet, the non-human primate remains the gold-standard for the analysis of the neural basis of behavior, and as a bridge to the operation of the human brain. The challenge is to generalize across species in a way that exposes the operation of circuits as well as the relationship of circuits to behavior. Eye movements provide an opportunity to cross the bridge from mechanism to behavior through research on diverse species. Here, we review experiments and computational studies on a circuit function called “neural integration” that occurs in the brainstems of larval zebrafish, primates, and species “in between”. We show that analysis of circuit structure using modern molecular and imaging approaches in zebrafish has remarkable explanatory power for details of the responses of integrator neurons in the monkey. The combination of research from the two species has led to a much stronger hypothesis for the implementation of the neural integrator than could have been achieved using either species alone.

Image segmentation is a fundamental aspect of vision and a critical part of scene understanding. Our visual system rapidly and effortlessly segments scenes into component objects but the underlying neural basis is unknown. We studied single neurons in area V4 while monkeys discriminated partially occluded shapes. We found that many neurons tuned to boundary curvature maintained their shape selectivity over a large range of occlusion levels as compared to neurons that are not tuned to boundary curvature. This lends support to the hypothesis that segmentation in the face of occlusion may be solved by contour grouping.

AB  - Abstract
In recent years, the zebrafish has emerged as an appealing model system to tackle questions relating to the neural circuit basis of behavior. This can be attributed not just to the growing use of genetically tractable model organisms, but also in large part to the rapid advances in optical techniques for neuroscience, which are ideally suited for application to the small, transparent brain of the larval fish. Many characteristic features of vertebrate brains, from gross anatomy down to particular circuit motifs and cell-types, as well as conserved behaviors, can be found in zebrafish even just a few days post fertilization, and, at this early stage, the physical size of the brain makes it possible to analyze neural activity in a comprehensive fashion. In a recent study, we used a systematic and unbiased imaging method to record the pattern of activity dynamics throughout the whole brain of larval zebrafish during a simple visual behavior, the optokinetic response (OKR). This approach revealed the broadly distributed network of neurons that were active during the behavior and provided insights into the fine-scale functional architecture in the brain, inter-individual variability, and the spatial distribution of behaviorally relevant signals. Combined with mapping anatomical and functional connectivity, targeted electrophysiological recordings, and genetic labeling of specific populations, this comprehensive approach in zebrafish provides an unparalleled opportunity to study complete circuits in a behaving vertebrate animal.

AB  - Abstract
Decision making can be defined as the flexible integration and transformation of information from the external world into action. Recently, the development of novel genetic tools and new behavioral paradigms has made it attractive to study behavior of all kinds in rodents. By some perspectives, rodents are not an acceptable model for the study of decision making due to their simpler behavior often attributed to their less extensive cortical development when compared to non-human primates. We argue that decision making can be approached with a common framework across species. We review insights from comparative anatomy that suggest the expansion of cortical-striatal connectivity is a key development in evolutionary increases in behavioral flexibility. We briefly review studies that establish a role for corticostriatal circuits in integrative decision making. Finally, we provide an overview of a few recent, highly complementary rodent decision making studies using genetic tools, revealing with new cellular and temporal resolution how, when and where information can be integrated and compared in striatal circuits to influence choice.

AB  - Abstract
An animal’s survival strongly depends on a nervous system that can rapidly process and integrate the changing quality of its environment and promote the most appropriate physiological responses. This is amply demonstrated in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, where its sensory system has been shown to impact multiple physiological traits that range from behavior and developmental plasticity to longevity. Because of the accessibility of its nervous system and the number of tools available to study and manipulate its neural circuitry, C. elegans has thus become an important model organism in dissecting the mechanisms through which the nervous system promotes survival. Here we review our current understanding of how the C. elegans sensory system affects diverse physiological traits, whose coordination would be essential for survival under fluctuating environments. The knowledge we derive from the C. elegans studies should provide testable hypotheses in discovering similar mechanisms in higher animals.

AB  - Abstract
Can the human brain itself serve as a model for a systems neuroscience approach to understanding the human brain? After all, how the brain is able to create the richness and complexity of human behavior is still largely mysterious. What better choice to study that complexity than to study it in humans? However, measurements of brain activity typically need to be made non-invasively which puts severe constraints on what can be learned about the internal workings of the brain. Our approach has been to use a combination of psychophysics in which we can use human behavioral flexibility to make quantitative measurements of behavior and link those through computational models to measurements of cortical activity through magnetic resonance imaging. In particular, we have tested various computational hypotheses about what neural mechanisms could account for behavioral enhancement with spatial attention (Pestilli et al., 2011). Resting both on quantitative measurements and considerations of what is known through animal models, we concluded that weighting of sensory signals by the magnitude of their response is a neural mechanism for efficient selection of sensory signals and consequent improvements in behavioral performance with attention. While animal models have many technical advantages over studying the brain in humans, we believe that human systems neuroscience should endeavor to validate, replicate and extend basic knowledge learned from animal model systems and thus form a bridge to understanding how the brain creates the complex and rich cognitive capacities of humans.

A wide variety of species are used for the study of visual neuroscience. This is beneficial because fundamental mechanisms and theoretical principles of vision are likely to be highly conserved, while different species exhibit different visual capacities and present different technical advantages for experiments. Eight years ago my laboratory adopted the hooded rat as our primary preparation for vision research. To some this may be surprising, as nocturnal rodents have often been presumed to have poor vision and weak visual behavior. This commentary will provide my personal perspective on how I came to work with rats; discuss an example research project for which rats have been advantageous; and comment on the opportunities and challenges of the preparation.

AB  - Abstract
The study of motor control has long concerned itself with the origins of movement variability. Indeed, a common goal of many computational models of motor control is to predict the empirically observed patterns of movement variability. Competing models thus attempt to capture how the brain constrains variability that is detrimental and/or generates variability that might be beneficial. As humans, it is our own motor performance that interests us most we accept our variability as an essential part of being human, yet we are often frustrated when we cannot precisely repeat a desired movement. While movement variability is often productively studied in humans, uncovering its neural origins requires animal models. Below we describe recent research in which we were able to determine an important source of movement variability using a non-human primate model: the rhesus macaque. The macaque, much like the human, can produce flexible yet highly precise behavior. For this reason, among others, the macaque was an ideal model for the study of movement variability.

Animal models are a necessary component of systems neuroscience research. Determining which animal model to use for a given study involves a complicated calculus. Some experimental manipulations are easily made in some animal models but impossible in others. Some animal models are similar to humans with respect to particular scientific questions, and others are less so. In this review, I discuss work done in my laboratory to investigate the neural mechanisms of color vision in the rhesus macaque. The emphasis is on the strengths of the macaque model, but shortcomings are also discussed.

What do animals hear? While it remains challenging to adequately assess sensory perception in animal models, it is important to determine perceptual abilities in model systems to understand how physiological processes and plasticity relate to perception, learning, and cognition. Here we discuss hearing in rodents, reviewing previous and recent behavioral experiments querying acoustic perception in rats and mice, and examining the relation between behavioral data and electrophysiological recordings from the central auditory system. We focus on measurements of critical bands, which are psychoacoustic phenomena that seem to have a neural basis in the functional organization of the cochlea and the inferior colliculus. We then discuss how behavioral training, brain stimulation, and neuropathology impact auditory processing and perception.

AB  - Abstract
The enhanced vascular permeability is a major early brain injury following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). However, its mechanism is not clear yet. In this work, we explored its potential mechanism and investigated the roles of thrombomodulin (TM) in maintaining microvascular integrity after SAH. SAH models were established in adult male ICR mice (28–32 g) by endovascular perforation. TM was immediately administered by femoral vein injection following SAH. The brain water content, Evans Blue content and neurological functions were evaluated. Brain edema was also detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (T2 map). The siRNA technique, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence staining and western blotting were performed to explore the potential mechanism of TM treatment. The number of microthrombi in the hippocampus microvessels was also recorded. TM significantly decreased brain water content and Evans Blue content, alleviated brain edema and neurological deficits after SAH. The plasma concentration of activated protein C was increased after TM treatment. In addition, the levels of phospho-p38MAPK, phospho-p53, cleaved caspase-3, phospho-NF-κB (p65) were markedly decreased. Additionally, the loss of VE-cadherin and Occludin (markers of vascular integrity) and the number of microthrombi in the hippocampus were also reduced. Our results indicated that TM has protective effects on preserving microvascular integrity following SAH partly through preserving endothelial junction proteins and quenching apoptosis/inflammation in endothelial cells via blocking p38MAPK-p53/NF-κB (p65) pathway.

AB  - Abstract
In the retina, melatonin is secreted at night by rod/cone photoreceptors and serves as a dark-adaptive signal. Melatonin receptors have been found in many retinal neurons including melanopsin-containing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), suggesting it could modulate the physiology of these inner retinal photoreceptors. Here, we investigated whether melatonin modulates the alpha-like M4-type ipRGCs, which are believed to mediate image-forming vision as well as non-image-forming photoresponses. Applying melatonin during daytime (when endogenous melatonin secretion is low) caused whole-cell-recorded M4 cells’ rod/cone-driven depolarizing photoresponses to become broader and larger, whereas the associated elevation in spike rate was reduced. Melanopsin-based light responses were not affected significantly. Nighttime application of the melatonin receptor antagonist luzindole also altered M4 cells’ rod/cone-driven light responses but in the opposite ways: the duration and amplitude of the graded depolarization were reduced, whereas the accompanying spiking increase was enhanced. These luzindole-induced changes confirmed that M4 cells are modulated by endogenous melatonin. Melatonin could induce the above effects by acting directly on M4 cells because immunohistochemistry detected MT1 receptors in these cells, although it could also act presynaptically. Interestingly, the daytime and nighttime recordings showed significant differences in resting membrane potential, spontaneous spike rate and rod/cone-driven light responses, suggesting that M4 cells are under circadian control. This is the first report of a circadian variation in ipRGCs’ resting properties and synaptic input, and of melatoninergic modulation of ipRGCs.

Blockade of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) during the neonatal period has been reported to induce long-term behavioral and neurochemical alterations that are relevant to schizophrenia. In this study, we examined the effects of such treatment on recognition memory and hippocampal excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) balance in both adolescence and adulthood. After exposure to the NMDAR antagonist, MK-801, at postnatal days (PND) 5–14, male Sprague–Dawley rats were tested for object and object-in-context recognition memory during adolescence (PND 35) and adulthood (PND 63). The parvalbumin-positive (PV+) γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic interneurons and presynaptic markers for excitatory and inhibitory neurons, vesicular glutamate transporter-1 (VGLUT1) and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) were examined in the hippocampus to reflect the E/I balance. We found that rats receiving MK-801 treatment showed deficits of recognition memory, reduction in PV+ cell counts and upregulation of the VGLUT1/VGAT ratio in both adolescence and adulthood. Notably, the changes of the VGLUT1/VGAT ratio at the two time points exhibited distinct mechanisms. These results parallel findings of hippocampal abnormalities in schizophrenia and lend support to the usefulness of neonatal NMDAR blockade as a potential neurodevelopmental model for the disease.

Endocannabinoids modulate a diverse array of functions including progenitor cell proliferation in the central nervous system, and odorant detection and food intake in the mammalian central olfactory system and larval Xenopus laevis peripheral olfactory system. However, the presence and role of endocannabinoids in the peripheral olfactory epithelium have not been examined in mammals. We found the presence of cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) and cannabinoid type 2 (CB2) receptor protein and mRNA in the olfactory epithelium. Using either immunohistochemistry or calcium imaging we localized CB1 receptors on neurons, glia-like sustentacular cells, microvillous cells and progenitor-like basal cells. To examine the role of endocannabinoids, CB1- and CB2- receptor-deficient (CB1−/−/CB2−/−) mice were used. The endocannabinoid 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) was present at high levels in both C57BL/6 wildtype and CB1−/−/CB2−/− mice. 2-AG synthetic and degradative enzymes are expressed in wildtype mice. A small but significant decrease in basal cell and olfactory sensory neuron numbers was observed in CB1−/−/CB2−/− mice compared to wildtype mice. The decrease in olfactory sensory neurons did not translate to impairment in olfactory-mediated behaviors assessed by the buried food test and habituation/dishabituation test. Collectively, these data indicate the presence of an endocannabinoid system in the mouse olfactory epithelium. However, unlike in tadpoles, endocannabinoids do not modulate olfaction. Further investigation on the role of endocannabinoids in progenitor cell function in the olfactory epithelium is warranted.

Triclosan (TCS) is a commonly used antimicrobial agent in personal care and sanitizing products, as well as in household items. Numerous studies have demonstrated the presence of TCS in various human tissues. Several studies have reported the accumulation of TCS in fish and human brain tissue. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of TCS on apoptosis in mouse neocortical neurons after 7 days of culture in vitro following 3, 6 and 24 h of exposure. To explore the mechanism underlying the effects of TCS in neurons, we studied the activation and protein expression of the Fas receptor (FasR) and caspase-8, caspase-9 and caspase-3, as well as DNA fragmentation in TCS-treated cells. Cultures of neocortical neurons were prepared from Swiss mouse embryos on day 15/16 of gestation. The cells were cultured in phenol red-free Neurobasal medium with B27 and glutamine. The cultures were treated with concentrations of TCS ranging from 1 nM to 100 μM for 3, 6 and 24 h. The level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was measured in the culture medium to exclude the cytotoxic concentrations. The cytotoxic effects were only observed when the highest concentrations of TCS were used (50 and 100 μM). To study apoptosis, the activities of caspase-8, caspase-9 and caspase-3 were measured, and DNA fragmentation was evaluated. Our results are the first time to demonstrate that TCS can induce an apoptotic process in neocortical neurons in vitro. The data demonstrated that TCS caused caspase-3 activation, DNA fragmentation and apoptotic body formation. Non-cytotoxic concentrations of TCS activated the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, which is dependent on FasR and caspase-8 activation. However, it is also possible that TCS may activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway after long-term exposure. Therefore, further studies on the mechanism underlying the effects of TCS on the nervous system are needed.

AB  - Abstract
Objectives: Animal and human studies have shown that sleep may have an impact on functional recovery after brain damage. Baclofen (Bac) and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) have been shown to induce physiological sleep in humans, however, their effects in rodents are unclear. The aim of this study is to characterize sleep and electroencelphalogram (EEG) after Bac and GHB administration in rats. We hypothesized that both drugs would induce physiological sleep.

Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with EEG/electromyogram (EMG) electrodes for sleep recordings. Bac (10 or 20 mg/kg), GHB (150 or 300 mg/kg) or saline were injected 1 h after light and dark onset to evaluate time of day effect of the drugs. Vigilance states and EEG spectra were quantified.

Results: Bac and GHB induced a non-physiological state characterized by atypical behavior and an abnormal EEG pattern. After termination of this state, Bac was found to increase the duration of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (∼90 and 10 min, respectively), reduce sleep fragmentation and affect NREM sleep episode frequency and duration (p &lt; 0.05). GHB had no major effect on vigilance states. Bac drastically increased EEG power density in NREM sleep in the frequencies 1.5–6.5 and 9.5–21.5 Hz compared to saline (p &lt; 0.05), while GHB enhanced power in the 1–5-Hz frequency band and reduced it in the 7–9-Hz band. Slow-wave activity in NREM sleep was enhanced 1.5–3-fold during the first 1–2 h following termination of the non-physiological state. The magnitude of drug effects was stronger during the dark phase.

Conclusion: While both Bac and GHB induced a non-physiological resting state, only Bac facilitated and consolidated sleep, and promoted EEG delta oscillations thereafter. Hence, Bac can be considered a sleep-promoting drug and its effects on functional recovery after stroke can be evaluated both in humans and rats.

AB  - Abstract
The neuropeptide substance P is an excitatory neurotransmitter produced by various cells including neurons and microglia that is involved in regulating inflammation and cerebral blood flow—functions that affect sleep and slow-wave activity (SWA). Substance P is the major ligand for the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R), which is found throughout the brain including the cortex. The NK-1R is found on sleep-active cortical neurons expressing neuronal nitric oxide synthase whose activity is associated with SWA. We determined the effects of local cortical administration of a NK-1R agonist (substance P-fragment 1, 7) and a NK-1R antagonist (CP96345) on sleep and SWA in mice. The NK-1R agonist significantly enhanced SWA for several hours when applied locally to the cortex of the ipsilateral hemisphere as the electroencephalogram (EEG) electrode but not after application to the contralateral hemisphere when compared to saline vehicle control injections. In addition, a significant compensatory reduction in SWA was found after the NK-1R agonist-induced enhancements in SWA. Conversely, injections of the NK-1R antagonist into the cortex of the ipsilateral hemisphere of the EEG electrode attenuated SWA compared to vehicle injections but this effect was not found after injections of the NK-1R antagonist into contralateral hemisphere as the EEG electrode. Non-rapid eye movement sleep and rapid eye movement sleep duration responses after NK-1R agonist and antagonist injections were not significantly different from the responses to the vehicle. Our findings indicate that the substance P and the NK-1R are involved in regulating SWA locally.

AB  - Abstract
Many everyday tasks such as typing, grasping, and object manipulation require coordination of dynamic movement across multiple joints and digits. Playing a musical instrument is also one such task where the precise movement of multiple digits is transformed into specific sounds defined by the instrument. Through extensive practice musicians are able to produce precisely controlled movements to interact with the instrument and produce specific sequences of sounds. The present study aimed to determine what aspects of these dynamic movement patterns differ between pianists who have achieved professional status compared to amateur pianists that have also trained extensively. Common patterns of movement for each digit strike were observed for both professional and amateur pianists that were sequence specific, i.e. influenced by the digit performing the preceding strike. However, group differences were found in multi-digit movement patterns for sequences involving the ring or little finger. In some sequences, amateur subjects tended to work against the innate connectivity between digits while professionals allowed slight movement at non-striking digits (covariation) which was a more economical strategy. In other sequences professionals used more individuated finger movements for performance. Thus the present study provided evidence in favor of enhancement of both movement covariation and individuation across fingers in more skilled musicians, depending on fingering and movement sequence.

AB  - Abstract
The activation of α2-adrenoceptors with bilateral injections of moxonidine (α2-adrenoceptor and imidazoline receptor agonist) into the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) increases 1.8% NaCl intake induced by treatment with furosemide (FURO) + captopril (CAP) subcutaneously. In the present study, we analyzed licking microstructure during water and 1.8% NaCl intake to investigate the changes in orosensory and postingestive signals produced by moxonidine injected into the LPBN. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were treated with FURO + CAP combined with bilateral injections of vehicle or moxonidine (0.5 nmol/0.2 μl) into the LPBN. Bilateral injections of moxonidine into the LPBN increased FURO + CAP-induced 1.8% NaCl intake, without changing water intake. Microstructural analysis of licking behavior found that this increase in NaCl intake was a function of increased number of licking bursts from 15 to 75 min of the test (maximum of 49 ± 9 bursts/bin, vs. vehicle: 2 ± 2 bursts/bin). Analysis of the first 15 min of the test, when most of the licking behavior occurred, found no effect of moxonidine on the number of licks/burst for sodium intake (24 ± 5 licks/burst, vs. vehicle: 27 ± 8 licks/burst). This finding suggests that activation of α2-adrenoceptors in the LPBN affects postingestive signals that are important to inhibit and limit sodium intake by FURO + CAP-treated rats.

AB  - Abstract
We examined antinociception and gene expression of mu-opioid receptor 1 (MOR1) in some brain areas of cholestatic rats, 21 days after common bile duct ligation (BDL). Cholestasis was induced in male Wistar rats during laparotomy and common BDL. Pain behavior was assessed on days 7, 14 or 21 of BDL using a hotplate test in control, sham and cholestatic groups. On day 21 of BDL, other groups of rats were sacrificed, whole brains were extracted, and the hypothalamus, prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus and striatum in control, sham and cholestatic rats were dissected. We used a semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method for evaluating MOR1 gene expression. The results revealed that cholestatic rats showed significant antinociception on days 14 and 21 of ligation with the most significant effect on day 21, which was prevented by naloxone (1 mg/kg). On the other hand, the expression of MOR1 gene compared to the sham group was decreased by 42% in the hypothalamus, 41% in the PFC, and 67% in the hippocampus after 21 days of BDL, while no significant change in its expression in the striatum was observed. It can be concluded that a change in endogenous opioid levels and its subsequent influence on the gene expression of MOR in some areas of the rat brain may underlie the altered nociception and other possible pathological changes such as pruritus after induction of cholestasis.

AB  - Abstract
Although many studies have reported the influence of anesthetics on the shape of somatic evoked potential, none has evaluated the influence on the spatio-temporal pattern of neural activity in detail. It is practically impossible to analyze neural activities spatially, using conventional electrophysiological methods. Applying our multiple-site optical recording technique for measuring membrane potential from multiple-sites with a high time resolution, we compared the spatio-temporal pattern of the evoked activity under two different anesthetic conditions induced by urethane or α-chloralose. The somatic cortical response was evoked by electrical stimulation of the hindlimb, and the optical signals were recorded from the rat sensorimotor cortex stained with a voltage-sensitive dye (RH414). The evoked activity emerged in a restricted area and propagated in a concentric manner. The spatio-temporal pattern of the evoked activity was analyzed using isochrone maps. There were significant differences in the latency and propagation velocity of the evoked activity, as well as the full width at half maximum of optical signal between the two anesthetic conditions. Differences in the amplitude and the slope of the rising phase were not significant.

AB  - Abstract
Several lines of evidence indicate that the dorsal hippocampus (dH) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) regulate contextual fear conditioning. The prelimbic (PrL), infralimbic (IL) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) subregions of the mPFC likely play distinct roles in the expression of fear. Moreover, studies have highlighted the role of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT)- and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated mechanisms in the modulation of innate fear in the mPFC. The present study characterized dH-mPFC pathways and investigated the role of serotonergic and GABAergic mechanisms of the PrL, IL and ACC-area 1 (Cg1) in the elaboration of contextual fear conditioning using fear-potentiated startle (FPS) and freezing behavior in Rattus norvegicus. The results of neurotracing with microinjections of biotinylated dextran amine into the dH revealed a neural link of the dH with the PrL and ACC. Intra-PrL injections of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and the GABAA receptor-selective agonist muscimol reduced contextual FPS and freezing responses. Intra-Cg1 injections of muscimol but not 8-OH-DPAT decreased FPS and freezing responses. However, neither intra-IL injections of a 5-HT1A agonist nor of a GABAA agonist affected these defensive responses. Labeled neuronal fibers from the dH reached the superficial layers of the PrL cortex and spread to the inner layers of PrL and Cg1 cortices, supporting the pharmacological findings. The present results confirmed the involvement of PrL and Cg1 in the expression of FPS and freezing responses to aversive conditions. In addition, PrL serotoninergic mechanisms play a key role in contextual fear conditioning. This study suggests that PrL, IL and Cg1 distinctively contribute to the modulation of contextual fear conditioning.

AB  - Abstract
White matter (WM) impairment and motor deficit after stroke are directly related. However, WM injury mechanisms and their relation to motor disturbances are still poorly understood. In humans, the anterior choroidal artery (AChA) irrigates the internal capsule (IC), and stroke to this region can induce isolated motor impairment. The goal of this study was to analyze whether AChA occlusion can injure the IC in the marmoset monkey. The vascular distribution of the marmoset brain was examined by colored latex perfusion and revealed high resemblance to the human brain anatomy. Next, a new approach to electrocoagulate the AChA was developed and chronic experiments showed infarction compromising the IC on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning (day 4) and histology (day 11). Behavioral analysis was performed using a neurologic score previously developed and our own scoring method. Marmosets showed a decreased score that was still evident at day 10 after AChA electrocoagulation. We developed a new approach able to induce damage to the marmoset IC that may be useful for the detailed study of WM impairment and behavioral changes after stroke in the nonhuman primate.

AB  - Abstract
The hippocampus has been established as a site of plasticity during the acquisition of spatial memory. The memory for spatial locations is impaired in patients who develop hepatic encephalopathy (HE). We wondered how the hippocampus can manage different hippocampal-dependent tasks in a type B model of the early evolutive phases of HE induced by triple portal vein ligation. We used a one-trial object-place recognition task that involves making judgements about whether a stimulus was encountered before in that location and a reversal learning task performed in the Morris water maze that involves reward-guided behavior and decision making. Our behavioral results showed impairments in the acquisition of both tasks by the portal hypertension group compared with the sham-operated group. To label brain areas related to these tasks, we marked the expression of the c-Fos protein and revealed high c-Fos immunoreactivity in cornu ammonis 1 (CA1), cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) and entorhinal (Ent) cortex of the PH group compared with the SHAM group in the object-place recognition task and a decrease in c-Fos-positive cells in the reversal task in the CA1, CA3, dentate gyrus (DG), cingulate (CG), prelimbic (PL), and infralimbic (IL) cortices in the PH group compared with the SHAM group. In conclusion, the study corroborated the pivotal role of the hippocampus in spatial memory deficits found in the early stages of type B HE and noted its differential contribution in each of the tasks.

AB  - Abstract
Myelinogenesis is a scheduled process that is regulated by the intrinsic properties of the cell and extracellular signals. Galanin (GAL) is a bioactive neuropeptide that is widely distributed throughout the nervous system. Chronic increase in circulating GAL levels protects the demyelination processes. Furthermore, GAL is synthesized in myelin-producing glial cells, such as oligodendrocytes and its expression level is at its highest between postnatal days 10 and 40. In the present study, we use our GAL transgenic mouse model to examine the effects of GAL on postnatal myelinogenesis in the CNS. Although we observed no difference in the proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, we found that GAL has a strong pro-myelinating effect. The transgenic mice at postnatal day 10 appeared to undergo myelinogenesis at an accelerated rate, as demonstrated by the increase in myelin basic protein (MBP) synthesis. The immunohistochemical results are consistent with our preliminary findings that suggest that GAL is a regulator of myelination and may be one of the myelination promoters. This finding is especially important for studies focusing on endogenous molecules for treating myelin-related diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and other leukodystrophies.

The 70-kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) is known to protect the brain from injury through multiple mechanisms. We investigated the effect of pharmacological HSP70 induction in experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI). 3-month-old male C57/B6 mice were given 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) intraperitoneally (IP, 2 mg/kg) or intracerebroventricularly (ICV, 1 μg/kg) to determine whether HSP70 could be induced in the brain. Mice were subjected to TBI via cortical controlled impact, and were treated with 17-AAG (or vehicle) IP according to one of two treatment regimens: (1) 2 mg/kg at the time of injury, (2) a total of three doses (4 mg/kg) at 2 and 1 d prior to TBI and again at the time of injury. Brains were assessed for HSP70 induction, hemorrhage volume at 3 d, and lesion size at 14 d post-injury. Immunohistochemistry showed that both IP and ICV administration of 17-AAG increased HSP70 expression primarily in microglia and in a few neurons by 24 h but not in astrocytes. 17-AAG induced HSP70 in injured brain tissue as early as 6 h, peaking at 48 h and largely subsiding by 72 h after IP injection. Both treatment groups showed decreased hemorrhage volume relative to untreated mice as well as improved neurobehavioral outcomes. These observations indicate that pharmacologic HSP70 induction may prove to be a promising treatment for TBI.

AB  - Abstract
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants are the mainstay treatment for the 10–20% of pregnant and postpartum women who suffer major depression, but the effects of SSRIs on their children’s developing brain and later emotional health are poorly understood. SSRI use during pregnancy can elicit antidepressant withdrawal in newborns and increase toddlers’ anxiety and social avoidance. In rodents, perinatal SSRI exposure increases adult depression- and anxiety-like behavior, although certain individuals are more vulnerable to these effects than others. Our study establishes a rodent model of individual differences in susceptibility to perinatal SSRI exposure, utilizing selectively bred Low Responder (bLR) and High Responder (bHR) rats that were previously bred for high versus low behavioral response to novelty. Pregnant bHR/bLR females were chronically treated with the SSRI paroxetine (10 mg/kg/day p.o.) to examine its effects on offspring’s emotional behavior and gene expression in the developing brain. Paroxetine treatment had minimal effect on bHR/bLR dams’ pregnancy outcomes or maternal behavior. We found that bLR offspring, naturally prone to an inhibited/anxious temperament, were susceptible to behavioral abnormalities associated with perinatal SSRI exposure (which exacerbated their Forced Swim Test immobility), while high risk-taking bHR offspring were resistant. Microarray studies revealed robust perinatal SSRI-induced gene expression changes in the developing bLR hippocampus and amygdala (postnatal days 7–21), including transcripts involved in neurogenesis, synaptic vesicle components, and energy metabolism. These results highlight the bLR/bHR model as a useful tool to explore the neurobiology of individual differences in susceptibility to perinatal SSRI exposure.

The effects of motilin on voltage-dependent K+ currents in hippocampal neurons with the addition of l-arginine (l-AA), d-arginine (d-AA) and N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) were investigated in this study.
Methods
Mice (1–3 days old) were randomly assigned to different groups according to the addition of motilin, l-AA, d-AA, and l-NAME. The K+ current signals were detected by the whole-cell patch-clamp technique.
Results
Compared with the control group, the transient outward voltage-dependent K+ current was significantly inhibited by motilin added with l-AA. In contrast, the addition of motilin and l-NAME significantly increased the K+ current, while no significant change was detected by the addition of motilin accompanied with d-AA.
Conclusion
The inhibiting effects of motilin on the voltage-dependent K+ current in hippocampal neurons indicate that motilin acts as a regulatory factor for the nitric oxide pathway.

AB  - Abstract
Human brain oscillations represent important features of information processing and are highly heritable. Gender has been observed to affect association between the 5-HTTLPR (serotonin-transporter-linked polymorphic region) polymorphism and various endophenotypes. This study aimed to investigate the effects of 5-HTTLPR on the spontaneous electroencephalography (EEG) activity in healthy male and female subjects. DNA samples extracted from buccal swabs and resting EEG recorded at 60 standard leads were collected from 210 (101 men and 109 women) volunteers. Spectral EEG power estimates and cortical sources of EEG activity were investigated. It was shown that effects of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism on electrical activity of the brain vary as a function of gender. Women with the S/L genotype had greater global EEG power compared to men with the same genotype. In men, current source density was markedly different among genotype groups in only alpha 2 and alpha 3 frequency ranges: S/S allele carriers had higher current source density estimates in the left inferior parietal lobule in comparison with the L/L group. In women, genotype difference in global power asymmetry was found in the central-temporal region. Contrasting L/L and S/L genotype carriers also yielded significant effects in the right hemisphere inferior parietal lobule and the right postcentral gyrus with L/L genotype carriers showing lower current source density estimates than S/L genotype carriers in all but gamma bands. So, in women, the effects of 5-HTTLPR polymorphism were associated with modulation of the EEG activity in a wide range of EEG frequencies. The significance of the results lies in the demonstration of gene by sex interaction with resting EEG that has implications for understanding sex-related differences in affective states, emotion and cognition.

AB  - AbstractBackground
Rotenone is an environmental neurotoxin that induces accumulation of α-synuclein and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), but the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. We investigated whether rotenone induced impairment of autophagic flux and lysosomal functions.
Methods
Autophagy flux, accumulation of α-synuclein, lysosomal membrane integrity and neurodegeneration were assessed in the rotenone-treated rat model and PC12 cells, and the effects of the autophagy inducer trehalose on rotenone’s cytotoxicity were also studied.
Results
Rotenone administration significantly reduced motor activity and caused a loss of tyrosine hydroxylase in SNpc of Lewis rats. The degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons was accompanied by the deposition of α-synuclein aggregates, autophagosomes and redistribution of cathepsin D from lysosomes to the cytosol. In cultured PC12 cells, rotenone also induced increases in protein levels of α-synuclein, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II, Beclin 1, and p62. Rotenone increased lysosomal membrane permeability as evidenced by leakage of N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase and cathepsin D, the effects were blocked by reactive oxygen species scavenger tiron. Autophagy inducer trehalose enhanced the nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB, accelerated the clearance of autophagosomes and α-synuclein and attenuated rotenone-induced cell death of PC12 cells. Meanwhile, administration of trehalose to rats in drinking water (2%) decreased rotenone-induced dopaminergic neurons loss in SNpc.
Conclusions
These studies indicate that the lysosomal dysfunction contributes to rotenone’s neurotoxicity and restoration of lysosomal function could be a new therapeutic strategy for Parkinson’s disease.

AB  - Abstract
Neural cross-sensitization has been postulated as a mechanism underlying overlaps of chronic pelvic pain disorders such as bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (BPS/IC) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Animals with experimental colitis have been used to study the underlying mechanisms for overlapped pelvic pain symptoms, and shown to exhibit bladder overactivity evidenced by frequent voiding; however, it has not directly been evaluated whether pain sensation derived from the lower urinary tract is enhanced in colitis models. Also, the cross-sensitization between the colon and urethra has not been studied previously. In the present study, we therefore investigated pain behaviors induced by nociceptive stimuli in the lower urinary tract and the involvement of C-fiber afferent pathways using rats with colitis induced by intracolonic application of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS). In TNBS-induced colitis rats at 10 days, intravesical application of resiniferatoxin (RTx) induced a significantly greater number of episodes of both licking and freezing behaviors, which were reduced by capsaicin-sensitive C-fiber afferent desensitization. Histochemical studies using fluorescent dye tracers injected into the colon, bladder or urethra showed that dichotomized afferent neurons comprised 6.9–14.5% of L1, L6 and S1 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons innervating the colon or the lower urinary tract. Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) mRNA expression was significantly increased in, the bladder, urethra and S1 DRG in colitis rats. An increase in myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was found in the colon, but not in the bladder or urethra after intracolonic TNBS treatment. These results indicate that TNBS-induced colitis increased pain sensitivity in the bladder and urethra via activation of C-fiber afferent pathways due to colon-to-bladder and colon-to-urethral cross-sensitization, suggesting the contribution of pelvic organ cross-sensitization mechanisms to overlapped pain symptoms in BPS/IC and IBS.

AB  - Abstract
Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is one of the foremost neurological conditions leading to long-term abnormalities in premature infants. Since it is difficult to prevent initiation of this damage in utero, promoting the innate regenerative potential of the brain after birth may provide a more feasible, prospective therapy for PVL. Treatment with UDP-glucose (UDPG), an endogenous agonist of G protein-coupled receptor 17 (GPR17) that may enhance endogenous self-repair potentiality, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), a neurotrophic factor associated with the growth and survival of nerve cells, and memantine, a noncompetitive antagonist of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors that block ischemia-induced glutamate signal transduction, has been reported to achieve functional, neurological improvement in neonatal rats with PVL.

The aim of the present study was to further explore whether UDPG, GDNF and/or memantine could promote corresponding self-repair of the subventricular zone (SVZ) and white matter (WM) in neonatal rats with ischemia-induced PVL. SVZ or WM tissue samples and cultured glial progenitor cells derived from a 5 day-old neonatal rat model of PVL were utilized for studying response to UDPG, GDNF and memantine in vivo and in vitro, respectively. Labeling with 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine and immunofluorescent cell lineage markers after hypoxia–ischemia or oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) revealed that UDPG, GDNF and memantine each significantly increased glial progenitor cells and preoligodendrocytes (preOLs), as well as more differentiated immature and mature oligodendrocyte (OL), in both the SVZ and WM in vivo or in vitro. SVZ and WM glial cell apoptosis was also significantly reduced by UDPG, GDNF or memantine, both in vivo and in vitro.

These results indicated that UDPG, GDNF or memantine may promote endogenous self-repair by stimulating proliferation of glial progenitor cells derived from both the SVZ and WM, activating their differentiation into more mature OLs, and raising the survival rate of these newly generated glial cells in neonatal rats with ischemic PVL.

AB  - Abstract
The effects of the ibotenic acid infused into the area of the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT) of rats on the expression of cortical and accumbal neuropeptides were assessed. The effects of this manipulation were determined in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) by estimating the numerical density of varicosities immunoreactive for vesicular acetylcholine transporter and the total number of NAc neurons immunoreactive for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) as well as the total number of mPFC neurons immunoreactive for NPY and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). In LDT-lesioned rats, the density of the cholinergic varicosities was reduced in the ventral divisions of the mPFC and in all divisions of the NAc. In addition, in these rats, the total number of NPY-immunoreactive neurons was reduced in all subregions of the mPFC and in the NAc. Conversely, the total number of VIP-immunoreactive neurons in the mPFC and of ChAT-immunoreactive neurons in the NAc did not differ between LDT- and sham-lesioned rats. These data provide the first direct evidence for a relationship between selective damage of LDT cholinergic neurons and decreased expression of NPY in the mPFC and NAc. They also reveal that different types of cortical and accumbal interneurons respond differently to the cholinergic denervation induced by LDT lesions.

AB  - Abstract
Under inflammatory conditions, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) modulates neural stem cells at neurogenic niches. Here we show that spinal cord injury in rats increases IL-1β expression in astrocytes located around the spinal cord ependyma, a region that also holds a neurogenic potential. IL-1β increases from day 1 after lesion, reaches maximal levels between days 3 and 7, and declines from 14 days to low levels after 28 days. At the time of maximal expression, periependymal upregulation of IL-1β extends beyond 5 mm from the epicenter of the lesion both rostral and caudally. Since IL-1β controls proliferation and cell fate of neural stem/precursor cells, its modulation in periependymal astrocytes might create an appropriate environment for cell replacement after injury.

AB  - Abstract
PUMA (p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis), a BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 protein family, is required for p53-dependent and p53-independent forms of apoptosis. PUMA has been invovled in the onset and progress of several diseases, including cancer, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and ischemic brain disease. Although many studies have shown that ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) can induce the apoptosis of astrocytes, the role of PUMA in I/R-mediated apoptosis of cerebral astrocyte apoptosis remains unclear. To mimic in vivo I/R conditions, primary mouse cerebral astrocytes were incubated in a combinational cultural condition of oxygen, glucose, and serum deprivation (OSGD) for 1 h followed by reperfusion (OSGD/R). Cell death determination assays and cell viability assays indicated that OSGD and OSGD/R induce the apoptosis of primary cerebral astrocytes. The expression of PUMA was significantly elevated in primary cerebral astrocytes during OSGD/R. Moreover, targeted down-regulation of PUMA by siRNA transfection significantly decreased the OSGD/R-induced apoptosis of primary cerebral astrocytes. We also found that OSGD and OSGD/R triggered the release of cytochrome c in astrocytes, indicating the dependence on a mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was extremely generated during OSGD and OSGD/R, and the elimination of ROS by treated with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) remarkably inhibited the expression of PUMA and the apoptosis of primary cerebral astrocytes. The activation of Caspase 3 and Caspase 9 was extremely elevated in primary cerebral astrocytes during OSGD. In addition, we found that knockdown of PUMA led to the depressed expression of Bax, cleaved caspase-9 and caspase-3 during OSGD/R. These results indicate that PUMA is invovled in the apoptosis of cerebral astrocytes upon I/R injury.

AB  - Abstract
Neuritis can cause pain hypersensitivities in the absence of axonal degeneration. Such hypersensitivities are reputed to be maintained by ongoing activity into the spinal cord, which, in the neuritis model, is mainly generated from intact C-fiber neurons. The hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) family of ion channels has been implicated in nerve injury-induced pain hypersensitivities. The present study has examined the role of these channels in the development of heat and mechanical hypersensitivities in the neuritis model. The systemic administration of the HCN-specific blocker ZD7288 produced a reversal of heat but not mechanical hypersensitivity within one hour post-administration. Recordings from C-fiber neurons were performed to determine whether ZD7288 acts by inhibiting ongoing activity. ZD7288 (0.5 mM) caused a 44.1% decrease in the ongoing activity rate following its application to the neuritis site. Immunohistochemical examination of the HCN2 channel subtype within the L5 dorsal root ganglia revealed an increase in expression in neuronal cell bodies of all sizes post-neuritis. In conclusion, HCN channels contribute to the development of neuritis-induced heat hypersensitivity and ongoing activity. Drugs that target HCN channels may be beneficial in the treatment of neuropathic pain in patients with nerve inflammation.

Bone morphogenetic protein-5 (BMP5), a member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, has many effects in several biological events. Although BMP5 expression has been well reported in the early development of the central nervous system (CNS), there is little information about its expression in the adult CNS. Thus, we analyzed BMP5 expression in the adult rat CNS by immunohistochemistry. Abundant BMP5 expression was observed in most neurons, and their dendrites and axons. Furthermore, strong BMP5 expression was also detected in the neuropil of the gray matters with high plasticity, such as the molecular layer of the cerebellum, locus coeruleus, and nucleus of the solitary tract. In addition, we showed BMP5 expression also in astrocytes, ependymal cells and meninges. Our data suggest that BMP5 is widely expressed throughout the adult CNS, and this abundant expression in the adult brain strongly supports the idea that BMP5 plays important roles not only in the developing brain but also in the adult brain.

AB  - Abstract
The zebrafish olfactory system is a valuable model for examining neural regeneration after damage due to the remarkable plasticity of this sensory system and of fish species. We applied detergent to the olfactory organ and examined the effects on both morphology and function of the olfactory system in adult zebrafish. Olfactory organs were treated once with Triton X-100 unilaterally to study glomerular innervation patterns or bilaterally to study odor detection. Fish were allowed to recover for 4–10 days and were compared to untreated control fish. Axonal projections were analyzed using whole mount immunocytochemistry with anti-keyhole limpet hemocyanin, a marker of olfactory axons in teleosts. Chemical lesioning of the olfactory organ with a single dose of Triton X-100 had profound effects on glomerular distribution in the olfactory bulb at 4 days after treatment, with the most significant effects in the medial region of the bulb. Glomeruli had returned by 7 days post-treatment. Analysis of the ability of the fish to detect cocktails of amino acids or bile salts consisted of counting the number of turns the fish made before and after odorant delivery. Control fish turned more after exposure to both odorants. Fish tested 4 and 7 days after chemical lesioning made more turns in response to amino acids but did not respond to bile salts. At 10 days post-lesion, these fish had regained the ability to detect bile salts. Thus, the changes seen in bulbar innervation patterns correlated to odorant-mediated behavior. We show that the adult zebrafish brain has the capacity to recover rapidly from detergent damage of the olfactory epithelium, with both glomerular distribution and odorant-mediated behavior returning in 10 days.

AB  - Abstract
Dopamine (DA) releasing midbrain neurons are essential for multiple brain functions, such as voluntary movement, working memory, emotion and cognition. DA midbrain neurons within the substantia nigra (SN) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) exhibit a variety of distinct axonal projections and cellular properties, and are differentially affected in diseases like schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Apart from having diverse functions in health and disease states, DA midbrain neurons display distinct electrical activity patterns, crucial for DA release. These activity patterns are generated and modulated by specific sets of ion channels. Recently, two ion channels have been identified, not only contributing to these activity patterns and to functional properties of DA midbrain neurons, but also seem to render SN DA neurons particularly vulnerable to degeneration in PD and its animal models: L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) and ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K-ATPs). In this review, we focus on the emerging physiological and pathophysiological roles of these two ion channels (and their complex interplay with other ion channels), particularly in highly vulnerable SN DA neurons, as selective degeneration of these neurons causes the major motor symptoms of PD.

AB  - AbstractBackground
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by progressive and irreversible cognitive and memory impairment. The discovery of familial forms of AD (fAD) in association with specific gene mutations facilitated the generation of numerous rodent models. These models in turn proved valuable for the study of molecular mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis, and facilitated translational research and preclinical drug development. This study aimed to introduce a new rat model of AD simulating some aspects of the sporadic cases of disease.
Methods
Lentiviruses (LV) encoding human amyloid protein precursor (APP) bearing the fAD-linked Swedish and Indiana mutations (APPSw/Ind) were injected bilaterally in the hippocampus of adult rats. Passive avoidance and spatial memory performance were assessed 30 and 45 days post-injection, respectively. APP overexpression, intracellular accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide, and astrogliosis were also evaluated using immunohistochemical procedures.
Results
Passive avoidance memory deficit was followed by impairments in spatial memory retrieval in LV (APPSw/Ind)-injected rats, compared to control animals. In addition, LV expression of APPSw/Ind was associated with intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ, and reactive astrocytosis, two major AD hallmarks.
Conclusion
Results from this work suggest that LV-mediated delivery of APPSw/Ind in adult rats represents a cost and time-effective animal model for the study of mechanisms underlying APP-linked fAD pathogenesis. The relevance of this animal model to the study of sporadic AD is discussed.

AB  - Abstract
Many studies have demonstrated that chronic exposure to nicotine, one of the main components of tobacco smoke, has profound effects on the functionality of the mammalian taste system. However, the mechanisms underlying nicotine action are poorly understood. In particular no information is available on the chronic effect of nicotine on the functioning of taste cells, the peripheral detectors which transduce food chemicals into electrical signals to the brain. To address this issue, I studied the membrane properties of rat fungiform taste cells and evaluated the effect of long-term exposure to nicotine on the amiloride-sensitive sodium currents (ASSCs). These currents are mediated by the epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) thought to be important, at least in part, in the transduction of salty stimuli. Patch-clamp recording data indicated that ASSCs in taste cells from rats chronically treated with nicotine had a reduced amplitude compared to controls. The pharmacological and biophysical analysis of ASSCs revealed that amplitude reduction was not dependent on changes in amiloride sensitivity or channel ionic permeability, but likely derived from a decrease in the activity of ENaCs. Since these channels are considered to be sodium receptors in taste cells, my results suggest that chronic exposure to nicotine hampers the capability of these cells to respond to sodium ions. This might represent a possible cellular mechanism underlying the reduced taste sensitivity to salt typically found in smokers.

EphB receptors and their ephrinB ligands are implicated in modulating of spinal nociceptive information processing. Here, we investigated whether protein kinase A (PKA), acts as a downstream effector, participates in the modulation spinal nociceptive information related to ephrinB–EphB signaling. Intrathecal injection of ephrinB2-Fc caused thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia, which were accompanied by increased expression of spinal PKA catalytic subunit (PKAca) and phosphorylated cAMP-response element-binding protein (p-CREB). Pre-treatment with H89, a PKA inhibitor, prevented the activation of CREB by ephrinB2-Fc. Inhibition of spinal PKA signaling prevented and reversed pain behaviors induced by the intrathecal injection of ephrinB2-Fc. Furthermore, blockade of the EphB receptors by intrathecal injection of EphB2-Fc reduced formalin-induced inflammatory, chronic constrictive injury (CCI)-induced neuropathic, and tibia bone cavity tumor cell implantation (TCI)-induced bone cancer pain behaviors, which were accompanied by decreased expression of spinal PKAca and p-CREB. Overall, these results confirmed the important involvement of PKA in the modulation of spinal nociceptive information related to ephrinBs–EphBs signaling. This finding may have important implications for exploring the roles and mechanisms of ephrinB–EphB signaling in physiologic and pathologic pain.

AB  - Abstract
Motor deficits are present in cardiac arrest survivors and injury to cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) likely contribute to impairments in motor coordination and post-hypoxic myoclonus. N-Methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor-mediated excitotoxicity is a well-established mechanism of cell death in several brain regions, but the role of NMDA receptors in PC injury remains understudied. Emerging data in cortical and hippocampal neurons indicate that the GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors signal to improve cell survival and GluN2B-containing receptors contribute to neuronal injury. This study compared neuronal injury in the hippocampal CA1 region to that in PCs and investigated the role of NMDA receptors in PC injury in our mouse model of cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR). Analysis of cell density demonstrated a 24% loss of PCs within 24 h after 8 min CA/CPR and injury stabilized to 33% by 7 days. The subunit promiscuous NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 protected both CA1 neurons and PCs from ischemic injury following CA/CPR, demonstrating a role for NMDA receptor activation in injury to both brain regions. In contrast, the GluN2B antagonist, Co 101244, had no effect on PC loss while protecting against injury in the CA1 region. These data indicate that ischemic injury to cerebellar PCs progresses via different cell death mechanisms compared to hippocampal CA1 neurons.

AB  - Abstract
Acetylcholine (ACh) is well known to induce persistent γ-oscillations in the hippocampus when applied together with physostigmine, an inhibitor of the ACh degrading enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Here we report that physostigmine alone can also dose-dependently induce γ-oscillations in rat hippocampal slices. We hypothesized that this effect was due to the presence of choline in the extracellular space and that this choline is taken up into cholinergic fibers where it is converted to ACh by the enzyme choline-acetyltransferase (ChAT). Release of ACh from cholinergic fibers in turn may then induce γ-oscillations. We therefore tested the effects of the choline uptake inhibitor hemicholinium-3 (HC-3) on persistent γ-oscillations either induced by physostigmine alone or by co-application of ACh and physostigmine. We found that HC-3 itself did not induce γ-oscillations and also did not prevent physostigmine-induced γ-oscillation while washout of physostigmine and ACh-induced γ-oscillations was accelerated. It was recently reported that ChAT might also be present in the extracellular space (Vijayaraghavan et al., 2013). Here we show that the effect of physostigmine was prevented by the ChAT inhibitor (2-benzoylethyl)-trimethylammonium iodide (BETA) which could indicate extracellular synthesis of ACh. However, when we tested for effects of extracellularly applied acetyl-CoA, a substrate of ChAT for synthesis of ACh, physostigmine-induced γ-oscillations were attenuated. Together, these findings do not support the idea that ACh can be synthesized by an extracellularly located ChAT.

AB  - Abstract
The perception of co-speech gestures, i.e., hand movements that co-occur with speech, has been investigated by several studies. The results show that the perception of co-speech gestures engages a core set of frontal, temporal, and parietal areas. However, no study has yet investigated the neural processes underlying the production of co-speech gestures. Specifically, it remains an open question whether Broca’s area is central to the coordination of speech and gestures as has been suggested previously. The objective of this study was to use functional magnetic resonance imaging to (i) investigate the regional activations underlying overt production of speech, gestures, and co-speech gestures, and (ii) examine functional connectivity with Broca’s area. We hypothesized that co-speech gesture production would activate frontal, temporal, and parietal regions that are similar to areas previously found during co-speech gesture perception and that both speech and gesture as well as co-speech gesture production would engage a neural network connected to Broca’s area. Whole-brain analysis confirmed our hypothesis and showed that co-speech gesturing did engage brain areas that form part of networks known to subserve language and gesture. Functional connectivity analysis further revealed a functional network connected to Broca’s area that is common to speech, gesture, and co-speech gesture production. This network consists of brain areas that play essential roles in motor control, suggesting that the coordination of speech and gesture is mediated by a shared motor control network. Our findings thus lend support to the idea that speech can influence co-speech gesture production on a motoric level.

AB  - Abstract
We examined whether a non-selective antagonist of nAChRs mecamylamine and selective antagonists of α4β2-containing nAChRs dihydro-β-erythroidine (DHβE) and α7-containing nAChRs methyllycaconitine (MLA) affect learning performance and synaptic efficiency in the CA1 area of the hippocampus of freely moving rats during the memory consolidation period. Adult male Wistar rats received mecamylamine (0.5 mg/kg), DHβE (1 mg/kg), MLA (2 mg/kg) or saline immediately after training in a passive avoidance task. Memory retention was examined 24 h after the training. The changes in the latency of the first entry into a dark compartment of a test chamber were chosen as a criterion of learning. The ability of nAChRs antagonists to induce changes in the basal level of focal potentials (fEPSP, field excitatory postsynaptic potential) was estimated before training (baseline), 90 min after the training (consolidation period) and 24 h after the training (retention period). We found that in untrained rats mecamylamine, DHβE and MLA diminished the amplitude of fEPSP within the first 90 min after the injection; similar effect was observed in DHβE- and MLA-treated trained animals. These suppressive effects of DHβE and MLA were associated with memory loss. In contrast, mecamylamine, when applied to trained animals, tended to increase latency to enter the dark chamber and did not influence fEPSP during first 90 min after injection. Thus, the nAChRs antagonists with different selectivity induced different changes in fEPSP and behavior which suggests that nAChRs with different subunit composition are diversely involved in memory consolidation.

AB  - Abstract
In mice, the compact hippocampal primordium is formed during the prenatal stage by early-generated neurons that migrate from the lateral ventricular zone. However, despite much being understood about the formation of the hippocampus, the molecular mechanisms that maintain the morphology of the hippocampal primordium after its formation remain to be characterized. β-Catenin is a key factor of canonical Wnt signaling and also a component of adherens junctions. Previous embryonic deletion studies have demonstrated that β-catenin is required for early development and generation of granule cells. However, whether β-catenin is involved in the morphological maintenance of the hippocampus as a cell adhesion molecule is still unknown. Here, we report that perinatal deletion of β-catenin in postmitotic neurons and some radial glial cells of hippocampus using CamKIIα-iCre; β-cateninflox/flox conditional knockout mice, leads to disorganization of the radial glial scaffold and consequentially severe defects in hippocampal morphology. We demonstrate that β-catenin is required for maintaining radial glial scaffold possibly via its well-known role in cell adhesion during the perinatal period. These findings provide essential advances into our understanding of the maintenance of the hippocampal primordium during the perinatal period.

AB  - Abstract
Mice of C57BL/6J strain were exposed to 1-month spaceflight on Russian biosatellite Bion-M1 to determine the effect of long-term actual spaceflight on the expression of genes involved in the processes of neurogenesis and apoptosis. Specifically, we focused on the genes encoding proapoptotic factor BAX, antiapoptotic factor BCL-XL, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and BDNF receptors TrkB and p75. Spaceflight reduced the expression of the antiapoptotic BCL-XL gene in the striatum and hypothalamus, but increased it in the hippocampus. To estimate environmental stress contribution into spaceflight effects we analyzed spaceflight-responsive genes in mice housed for 1 month on Earth in the same shuttle cabins that were used for spaceflight, and in mice of the laboratory control group. It was shown that 1-month shuttle cabin housing decreased BCL-XL gene expression in the striatum but failed to alter BCL-XL mRNA levels in the hippocampus or hypothalamus. Spaceflight failed to alter the expression of the proapoptotic BAX gene in all investigated brain structures, although the insignificant increase of the BAX mRNA level in the hippocampus of spaceflight mice was found. At the same time, shuttle cabin housing produced insignificant decrease in BAX gene expression in the hippocampus. In contrast to the BCL-XL gene, genes encoding BAX, BDNF as well as TrkB and p75 receptors did not respond to 30-day spaceflight. Thus, long-term spaceflight (1) did not affect the expression of genes encoding BDNF as well as TrkB and p75 receptors, (2) produced dysregulation in genetic control of the neuronal apoptosis, (3) implicated BCL-XL as the risk factor for spaceflight-induced behavioral abnormalities.

AB  - Abstract
The blood retinal barrier (BRB) can mitigate deleterious immune response. Dysfunction at the BRB can affect disease progression. Under inflammatory conditions Müller glia produce increased pro-inflammatory factors, like nitric oxide (NO). In this study we describe molecular events at the Müller glia during inflammation which could affect inner BRB properties. Griess assay and 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate (DAF-2DA) time-lapse fluorescence were used to measure NO production. Western blot was used to analyze the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) components. Lucifer Yellow was used to measure permeability. Griess assay and DAF-2DA time-lapse fluorescence images revealed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced inflammation and increased NO production. In parallel, changes were observed in tight junction proteins, zona occludens 1 (ZO-1), connexin 43 (Cx43), and permeability. This was mediated through activation of iNOS and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1), implicated in immune response. Endocannabinoids can exert a protective and anti-inflammatory effect. Exogenous arachidonoyl ethanolamide (AEA) inhibited NO generation and also abolished LPS-induced increase in permeability. Our work suggests that subtle changes in Müller glia function, which act as part of the BRB, could contribute to retinal health. AEA which can reduce inflammatory cytotoxicity has potential as treatment in several ocular manifestations where the integrity of the BRB is crucial.

AB  - Abstract
Spontaneous nerve regeneration beyond the scar frequently occurs in fish after spinal cord lesions, in contrast to mammals. Here we examined the spatiotemporal relationship between the fibrous scar and axonal regeneration in the goldfish. Within 1 week after hemisection of the spinal cord, the open wound was closed by a fibrous scar that was demarcated from the surrounding nervous tissue by the glia limitans, which was immunoreactive for laminin. Within 1 week after hemisection, regenerating axons entered the fibrous scar, and were surrounded by laminin-coated tubular structures continuous with the glia limitans. Regenerating axons that initially entered the fibrous scar were usually accompanied by glial processes. Within 2–3 weeks after hemisection, the tubular structures became enlarged, and the regenerating axons increased in number, fasciculating in the tubules. Glial processes immunoreactive for glial fibrillary acid protein and 5-hydroxytryptamine neurons then entered the tubular structures to associate with the regenerating axons. The tubular structures developed further, creating tunnels that penetrated the fibrous scar, through which the regenerating axons passed. At 6–12 weeks after hemisection, the fibrous scar was smaller and the enlarged tunnels contained many glial processes and several axons.

The findings of present study demonstrated that, following spinal lesions in goldfish, regenerating axons enter and pass the scar tissue. The regenerating axons first enter the fibrous scar with glial elements and then grow through laminin-coated tubular structures within the fibrous scar. Invasion by glial processes and neuronal elements into the tubular structures reduces the fibrous scar area and allows for more regenerating axons to pass beyond the fibrous scar.

AB  - Abstract
Cognitive dysfunction is a major sign of cerebral malaria (CM). However, the underlying mechanisms of CM cognitive outcome remain poorly understood. A body of evidence suggests that adult neurogenesis may play a role in learning and memory processes. It has also been reported that these phenomena can be regulated by the immune system. We hypothesized that memory dysfunction in CM results from hippocampal neurogenesis impairment mediated by the deregulated immune response during the acute phase of CM. C57Bl/6 mice were infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) strain, using a standardized inoculation of 106 parasitized erythrocytes. Long-term working memory was evaluated using the novel object recognition test. The mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tropomyosin-receptor-kinase (TRK-B) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in the frontal cortex and hippocampus was estimated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The protein levels of cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and CCL11 and neurotrophins BDNF and NGF were determined using a cytometric bead array (CBA) kit or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cell viability in the hippocampus was analyzed by Confocal Microscopy. Neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus was determined through quantification of doublecortin (DCX) positive cells. PbA-infected mice presented working memory impairment on day 5 post-infection. At this same time point, CM mice exhibited a decrease in DCX-positive cells in the dentate gyrus in parallel with increased cell death and elevated inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ and CCL11) in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. A significant reduction of BDNF mRNA expression was also found. IL-6 and TNF-α correlated negatively with BDNF and NGF levels in the hippocampus of CM mice. In summary, we provide further evidence that neuroinflammation following PbA-infection influences neurotrophin expression, impairs adult hippocampal neurogenesis and increases hippocampal cell death in association with memory impairment following CM course. The current study identified potential mediators of memory impairment in CM.

AB  - Abstract
Previous studies that utilized task-based approaches have demonstrated that the chronic use of heroin is associated with altered activity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, few studies have focused on examining the variation in resting-state functional connectivity in heroin-dependent individuals, which might help further understanding the mechanisms underlying heroin addiction. Due to the structural and functional heterogeneity of the ACC, we systematically mapped the resting-state functional connectivity patterns of three sub-regions of the ACC in heroin-dependent individuals, wondered whether the partition of three sub-regions of the ACC is feasible in heroin-dependent individuals, and identified how heroin affected the correlated activities among three sub-regions of the ACC using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In the present study, fMRI data were acquired from 21 heroin-dependent individuals (Her group) and 15 non-addicted controls (CN group). Compared to controls, there were reduced functional connectivities in the dorsal ACC (dACC) and rostral ACC (rACC) networks with different areas of the dorsal striatum (the caudate and the putamen) in the Her group. Meanwhile, there exhibited an inverted alteration of pattern for orbital frontal cortex (OFC) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG) in the functional connectivity network with the dACC and subcallosal ACC (sACC), and a different alteration of the cerebellum and the amygdala in the functional connectivity network with the rACC and the sACC. In addition, we also found reduced connectivities between dACC and rACC, as well as reduced connectivities between sACC and dACC. Our findings of variations of functional connectivities in three sub-regions of ACC in Her group implied that these sub-regions of the ACC together with other key brain areas (such as dorsal striatum, OFC, SFG, cerebellum, amygdale, etc.) might potentially play independent and/or overlapping roles in heroin addiction, which might indicate the potential direction of future research.

AB  - Abstract
Dorsal vagal complex (DVC) AMPK regulation of food intake in the estradiol-treated ovariectomized (OVX) female rat is energy state-dependent. Here, RT-PCR array technology was used to identify estradiol-sensitive AMPK-regulated DVC signal transduction pathways that exhibit differential reactivity to sensor activation during energy balance versus imbalance. The AMP mimetic AICAR correspondingly reduced or stimulated cDVC phosphoAMPK (pAMPK) and estrogen receptor-beta (ERβ) proteins in full-fed (F) versus 12-h food-deprived (D) estradiol-treated ovariectomized (OVX) rats, but elevated ER-alpha (ERα) in F only. Estradiol suppressed DVC ERβ protein and hypoxia, NFκB, STAT3, STAT6, and Hedgehog signaling pathway marker genes against oil-implanted OVX controls. F + (A)ICAR and D + (S)aline groups each exhibited further inhibition of NFκB, STAT3, and Hedgehog pathway genes, and diminished PPAR, Notch, and STAT5 transcripts versus F + S. Conversely, genes in these six pathways were up-regulated by AICAR treatment of D. Results show that in this animal model, acute AMP augmentation or feeding cessation each inhibit both pAMPK and ERβ expression, but in combination increase these protein profiles. pAMPK protein and DVC TNF (NFκB), SOCS3 (JAK/STAT), WNT6 (Hedgehog), and FABP1 (PPAR) mRNAs were down- or upregulated in parallel by AICAR in F versus D states, respectively. Further research is needed to determine the impact of ERβ on opposing directionality of these responses, and to characterize the role of the aforementioned signaling pathways in hyperphagic responses in the female to AICAR-induced DVC AMPK activation during acute interruption of feeding.

AB  - Abstract
Throughout adulthood, neurons are continuously replaced by new cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, and this neurogenesis is increased by various neuronal injuries including ischemic stroke and seizure. While several mechanisms of this injury-induced neurogenesis have been elucidated, the initiation factor remains unclear. Here, we investigated which signal(s) trigger(s) ischemia-induced cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the hippocampal DG region. We found that early apoptotic cell death of the immature neurons occurred in the DG region following transient forebrain ischemia/reperfusion in mice. Moreover, early immature neuronal death in the DG initiated transient forebrain ischemia/reperfusion-induced neurogenesis through glycogen synthase kinase-3β/β-catenin signaling, which was mediated by microglia-derived insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Additionally, we observed that the blockade of immature neuronal cell death, early microglial activation, or IGF-1 signaling attenuated ischemia-induced neurogenesis. These results suggest that early immature neuronal cell death initiates ischemia-induced neurogenesis through microglial IGF-1 in mice.

AB  - Abstract
Hyperglycemia accentuates the injury produced by anoxia both in the central and peripheral nervous system. To understand whether this is a consequence of changes in metabolic pathways produced by anoxia, the effect of the metabolic substrate used by the rat peripheral nerve on the nerve action potential (NAP) was studied in the presence and absence of anoxia. In the continuously oxygenated state, the NAP was well preserved with glucose, lactate, as well as with high concentrations of sorbitol and fructose but not β-hydroxybutyrate, acetate or galactose. With intermittent anoxia, the pattern of substrate effects on the NAP changed markedly so that low concentrations of fructose became able to support neurophysiologic activity but not high concentrations of glucose. These alterations occurred gradually with repeated episodes of anoxia as reflected by the progressive increase in the time needed for the NAP to disappear during anoxia when using glucose as substrate. This “preconditioning” effect was not seen with other substrates and an opposite effect was seen with lactate. In fact, the rate at which the NAP disappeared during anoxia was not simply related to degree of recovery after anoxia. These are distinct phenomena. For example, the NAP persisted longest during anoxia in the setting of hyperglycemia but this was the state in which the anoxic damage was most severe.

Correlating the results with existing literature on the metabolic functions of Schwann cells and axons generates testable hypotheses for the mechanism of hyperglycemic damage during anoxia and lead to discussions of the role for a metabolic shuttle between Schwann cells and axons as well as a potential important role of glycogen.

AB  - Abstract
Orexins are bioactive peptides, which have been shown to play a pivotal role in vigilance state transitions: the loss of orexin-producing neurons (orexin neurons) leads to narcolepsy with cataplexy in the human. However, the effect of the need for sleep (i.e., sleep pressure) on orexin neurons remains largely unknown. Here, we found that immunostaining intensities of the α1 subunit of the GABAA receptor and neuroligin 2, which is involved in inhibitory synapse specialization, on orexin neurons of mouse brain were significantly increased by 6-h sleep deprivation. In contrast, we noted that immunostaining intensities of the α2, γ2, and β2/3 subunits of the GABAA receptor and Huntingtin-associated protein 1, which is involved in GABAAR trafficking, were not changed by 6-h sleep deprivation. Using a slice patch recording, orexin neurons demonstrated increased sensitivity to a GABAA receptor agonist together with synaptic plasticity changes after sleep deprivation when compared with an ad lib sleep condition. In summary, the GABAergic input property of orexin neurons responds rapidly to sleep deprivation. This molecular response of orexin neurons may thus play a role in the changes that accompany the need for sleep following prolonged wakefulness, in particular the decreased probability of a transition to wakefulness once recovery sleep has begun.

AB  - Abstract
Wallerian degeneration (WD) is a process of axonal degeneration distal to the injury site followed by a robust regenerative response. It involves degeneration and regeneration which can be directly induced by nerve injury and activated by transcription factors. Although WD has been studied extensively, the precise mechanisms of transcription factors regulating WD are still elusive. In this study, we reported the effect of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) on WD after rat sciatic nerve injury. The data showed that TGF-β1 may express in injured rat sciatic nerve and cultured Schwann cells (SCs). Knock down of TGF-β1 expressions resulted in the reduction of SC proliferation and apoptosis, up regulation of cytokines and Smad2, 4. Enhanced expression of TGF-β1 could promote SC proliferation and apoptosis, down regulation of cytokines and Smad2, 4. Altered expressions of TGF-β1 may affect Smad and AKT but not c-Jun and extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) pathways. Our results revealed the role of TGF-β1 on WD and provided the basis for the molecular mechanisms of TGF-β1-regulated nerve degeneration and/or regeneration.

AB  - Abstract
Deciphering the molecular pathways involved in myelin gene expression is a major point of interest to better understand re/myelination processes. In this study, we investigated the role of Lithium Chloride (LiCl), a drug largely used for the treatment of neurological disorders, on the two major central myelin gene expression (PLP and MBP) in mouse oligodendrocytes. We show that LiCl enhances the expression of both PLP and MBP, by increasing mRNA amount and promoter activities. We investigated whether Wnt/β-catenin and/or Akt/CREB pathways are modulated by LiCl to regulate myelin gene expression. We showed that β -catenin is required both for PLP and MBP basal promoter activities and for LiCl-induced myelin gene stimulation. Furthermore, while CREB functionality does not influence PLP expression, MBP promoter activity depends on Akt/CREB activation. Finally, we show that LiCl can stimulate oligodendrocyte morphological maturation, and promote remyelination after lysolecithin-induced demyelination of organotypic cerebellar slice cultures. Our data provide mechanistic evidences that Akt/CREB together with β-catenin participate in the transcriptional control of PLP and MBP exerted by LiCl. Therefore, the use of LiCl to balance between β-catenin and CREB effectors could be considered as an efficient remyelinating strategy.

AB  - Abstract
In previous studies that used compacted DNA nanoparticles (DNP) to transfect cells in the brain, we observed higher transgene expression in the denervated striatum when compared to transgene expression in the intact striatum. We also observed that long-term transgene expression occurred in astrocytes as well as neurons. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the higher transgene expression observed in the denervated striatum may be a function of increased gliosis. Several aging studies have also reported an increase of gliosis as a function of normal aging. In this study we used DNPs that encoded for human glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (hGDNF) and either a non-specific human polyubiquitin C (UbC) or an astrocyte-specific human glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter. The DNPs were injected intracerebrally into the denervated or intact striatum of young, middle-aged or aged rats, and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) transgene expression was subsequently quantified in brain tissue samples. The results of our studies confirmed our earlier finding that transgene expression was higher in the denervated striatum when compared to intact striatum for DNPs incorporating either promoter. In addition, we observed significantly higher transgene expression in the denervated striatum of old rats when compared to young rats following injections of both types of DNPs. Stereological analysis of GFAP+ cells in the striatum confirmed an increase of GFAP+ cells in the denervated striatum when compared to the intact striatum and also an age-related increase; importantly, increases in GFAP+ cells closely matched the increases in GDNF transgene levels. Thus neurodegeneration and aging may lay a foundation that is actually beneficial for this particular type of gene therapy while other gene therapy techniques that target neurons are actually targeting cells that are decreasing as the disease progresses.

AB  - Abstract
Eider duck (Somateria mollissima) cerebellar neurons are highly tolerant toward hypoxia in vitro, which in part is due to a hypoxia-induced depression of their spontaneous activity. We have studied whether this response involves ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, which are known to be involved in the hypoxic/ischemic defense of mammalian neural and muscular tissues, by causing hyperpolarization and reduced ATP demand. Extracellular recordings in the Purkinje layer of isolated normoxic eider duck cerebellar slices showed that their spontaneous neuronal activity decreased significantly compared to in control slices when the KATP channel opener diazoxide (600 μM) was added (F1,70 = 92.781, p &lt; 0.001). Adding the KATP channel blocker tolbutamide (400 μM) 5 min prior to diazoxide completely abolished its effect (F1,55 = 39.639, p &lt; 0.001), strongly suggesting that these drugs have a similar mode of action in this avian species as in mammals. The spontaneous activity of slices treated with tolbutamide in combined hypoxia/chemical anoxia (95% N2–5% CO2 and 2 mM NaCN) was not significantly different from that of control slices (F1,203 = 0.071, p = 0.791). Recovery from hypoxia/anoxia was, however, slightly but significantly weaker in tolbutamide-treated slices than in control slices (F1,137 = 15.539, p &lt; 0.001). We conclude that KATP channels are present in eider duck cerebellar neurons and are activated in hypoxia/anoxia, but that they do not play a key role in the protective shut-down response to hypoxia/anoxia.

AB  - Abstract
Severe brain injuries can trigger epileptogenesis, a latent period that eventually leads to epilepsy. Previous studies have demonstrated that changes in local connectivity between cortical neurons are a part of the epileptogenic processes. In the present study we aimed to investigate whether changes in long-range connectivity are also involved in epileptogenesis.

We performed a large unilateral transection (undercut) of the white matter below the suprasylvian gyrus in cats. After about 2 months, we either injected retrograde tracer (cholera toxin, sub-unit B, CTB) or performed Golgi staining. We analyzed distribution of retrogradely labeled neurons, counted dendritic spines in the neocortex (Golgi staining), and analyzed dendritic orientation in control conditions and after the injury.

We found a significant increase in the number of detected cells at the frontal parts of the injured hemisphere, which suggests that the process of axonal sprouting occurs in the deafferented area. The increase in the number of retrogradely stained neurons was accompanied with a significant decrease in neocortical spine density in the undercut area, a reduction in vertical and an increase in horizontal orientation of neuronal processes.

The present study shows global morphological changes underlying epileptogenesis. An increased connectivity in the injured cortical regions accompanied with a decrease in spine density suggests that excitatory synapses might be formed on dendritic shafts, which probably contributes to the altered neuronal excitability that was described in previous studies on epileptogenesis.

The association between the clinical use of nitroglycerin (NTG) and migraine suggests NTG as an animal model trigger for migraine. NTG-induced hyperalgesia in rats has been extensively used as a migraine model for pre-clinical research. Pregabalin is an anti-epileptic drug and may play a role in the preventive treatment of migraine; however, the mechanism of this action remains to be clarified. Herein, we performed the present study to investigate the effect of pregabalin on the NTG-induced hyperalgesia in rats. Sixty male Sprague–Dawley rats were divided equally into six groups. Thirty minutes before NTG injection, the rats were pretreated with pregabalin. von Frey hair testing was employed to evaluate tactile sensitivity. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to analyze plasma calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) levels in the jugular vein. Immunohistochemistry was applied to detect c-Fos-immunoreactive neurons and western blot was performed to detect c-Fos protein expression in trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC). We found that pregabalin pretreatment alleviated the NTG-induced hyperalgesia. Moreover, pregabalin suppressed peripheral CGRP release, c-Fos-immunoreactive neurons and the protein expression of c-Fos in TNC as well. These data suggest that pregabalin could alleviate the NTG-induced hyperalgesia. Further studies are required to determine the mechanisms of action for this effect.

AB  - Abstract
Tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX-s) spontaneous activity is recorded from the dorsal roots after peripheral nerve injury. Primary sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) express multiple TTX-s voltage-gated sodium channel α-subunits (Navs). Since Nav1.3 increases, whereas all other Navs decrease, in the DRG neurons after peripheral nerve lesion, Nav1.3 is proposed to be critical for the generation of these spontaneous discharges and the contributions of other Navs have been ignored. Here, we re-evaluate the changes in expression of three other TTX-s Navs, Nav1.1, Nav1.6 and Nav1.7, in the injured 5th lumbar (L5) primary afferent components following L5 spinal nerve ligation (SNL) using in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry. While the overall signal intensities for these Nav mRNAs decreased, many injured DRG neurons still expressed these transcripts at clearly detectable levels. All these Nav proteins accumulated at the proximal stump of the ligated L5 spinal nerve. The immunostaining patterns of Nav1.6 and Nav1.7 associated with the nodes of Ranvier were maintained in the ipsilateral L5 dorsal root. Interestingly, putative proprioceptive neurons characterized by α3 Na+/K+ ATPase-immunostaining specifically lacked Nav1.7 mRNA in naïve DRG but displayed de novo expression of this transcript following SNL. Nav1.7-immunoreactive fibers were significantly increased in the ipsilateral gracile nucleus where central axonal branches of the injured A-fiber afferents terminated. These data indicate that multiple TTX-s channel subunits could contribute to the generation and propagation of the spontaneous discharges in the injured primary afferents. Specifically, Nav1.7 may cause some functional changes in sensory processing in the gracile nucleus after peripheral nerve injury.

Autism is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction and repetitive behaviors. Diagnosis of autism is currently phenotype based with no reliable laboratory test available to assist clinicians. It has been shown that dysfunction of serotonin (5-HT) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are involved in autism. The goal of this study was to evaluate the combined role of 5-HT and IL-6 as potential biomarkers for autism. The whole blood concentration of 5-HT and plasma concentration of IL-6 of individuals with autism were significantly elevated compared with the control group, and the concentration of 5-HT and IL-6 had positive correlations with the severity of autism. The results of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that the combination of 5-HT and IL-6 produced the best sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of autism. Therefore, the present study has revealed a simple clinical method with great potential for assisting the diagnosis of autism.

AB  - Abstract
Extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulates around different neuronal compartments of the central nervous system (CNS) or appears in diffuse reticular form throughout the neuropil. In the adult CNS, the perineuronal net (PNN) surrounds the perikarya and dendrites of various neuron types, whereas the axonal coats are aggregations of ECM around the individual synapses, and the nodal ECM is localized at the nodes of Ranvier. Previous studies in our laboratory demonstrated on rats that the heterogeneous distribution and molecular composition of ECM is associated with the variable cytoarchitecture and hodological organization of the vestibular nuclei and may also be related to their specific functions in gaze and posture control as well as in the compensatory mechanisms following vestibular lesion. Here, we investigated the ECM expression pattern in the climbing fiber-generating inferior olive (IO), which is functionally related to the vestibular nuclei. By using histochemical and immunohistochemical methods, the most characteristic finding was the lack of PNNs, presumably due to the absence of synapses on the perikarya and proximal dendrites of IO neurons. On the other hand, the darkly stained dots or ring-like structures in the neuropil might represent the periaxonal coats around the axon terminals of olivary synaptic glomeruli. We have observed positive ECM reaction for the hyaluronan, tenascin-R, hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein 1 (HAPLN1) and various chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. The staining intensity and distribution of ECM molecules revealed a number of differences between the functionally different subnuclei of IO. We hypothesized that the different molecular composition and intensity differences of ECM reaction is associated with different control mechanisms of gaze and posture control executed by the visuomotor-vestibular, somatosensory and integrative subnuclei of the IO.

AB  - Abstract
Neuromodulators rapidly alter activity of neural circuits and can therefore shape higher order functions, such as sensorimotor integration. Increasing evidence suggests that brain-derived estrogens, such as 17-β-estradiol, can act rapidly to modulate sensory processing. However, less is known about how rapid estrogen signaling can impact downstream circuits. Past studies have demonstrated that estradiol levels increase within the songbird auditory cortex (the caudomedial nidopallium, NCM) during social interactions. Local estradiol signaling enhances the auditory-evoked firing rate of neurons in NCM to a variety of stimuli, while also enhancing the selectivity of auditory-evoked responses of neurons in a downstream sensorimotor brain region, HVC (proper name). Since these two brain regions are not directly connected, we employed dual extracellular recordings in HVC and the upstream nucleus interfacialis of the nidopallium (NIf) during manipulations of estradiol within NCM to better understand the pathway by which estradiol signaling propagates to downstream circuits. NIf has direct input into HVC, passing auditory information into the vocal motor output pathway, and is a possible source of the neural selectivity within HVC. Here, during acute estradiol administration in NCM, NIf neurons showed increases in baseline firing rates and auditory-evoked firing rates to all stimuli. Furthermore, when estradiol synthesis was blocked in NCM, we observed simultaneous decreases in the selectivity of NIf and HVC neurons. These effects were not due to direct estradiol actions because NIf has little to no capability for local estrogen synthesis or estrogen receptors, and these effects were specific to NIf because other neurons immediately surrounding NIf did not show these changes. Our results demonstrate that transsynaptic, rapid fluctuations in neuroestrogens are transmitted into NIf and subsequently HVC, both regions important for sensorimotor integration. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that acute neurosteroid actions can propagate within and between neural circuits to modulate their functional connectivity.

AB  - Abstract
The goals of the present study were to determine (1) the properties of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) currents in rat cutaneous dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons; (2) the impact of nAChR activation on the excitability of cutaneous DRG neurons; and (3) the impact of inflammation on the density and distribution of nAChR currents among cutaneous DRG neurons. Whole-cell patch-clamp techniques were used to study retrogradely labeled DRG neurons from naïve and complete Freund’s adjuvant inflamed rats. Nicotine-evoked currents were detectable in ∼70% of the cutaneous DRG neurons, where only one of two current types, fast or slow currents based on rates of activation and inactivation, was present in each neuron. The biophysical and pharmacological properties of the fast current were consistent with nAChRs containing an α7 subunit while those of the slow current were consistent with nAChRs containing α3/β4 subunits. The majority of small diameter neurons with fast current were IB4− while the majority of small diameter neurons with slow current were IB4+. Preincubation with nicotine (1 μM) produced a transient (1 min) depolarization and increase in the excitability of neurons with fast current and a decrease in the amplitude of capsaicin-evoked current in neurons with slow current. Inflammation increased the current density of both slow and fast currents in small diameter neurons and increased the percentage of neurons with the fast current. With the relatively selective distribution of nAChR currents in putative nociceptive cutaneous DRG neurons, our results suggest that the role of these receptors in inflammatory hyperalgesia is likely to be complex and dependent on the concentration and timing of acetylcholine release in the periphery.

AB  - Abstract
Behavioral flexibility is known to be mediated by corticostriatal systems and to involve several major neurotransmitter signaling pathways. The current study investigated the effects of inactivation of glutamatergic N-methyl-d-aspartate-(NMDA) receptor signaling in the dorsal striatum on behavioral flexibility in mice. NMDA-receptor inactivation was achieved by virus-mediated inactivation of the Grin1 gene, which encodes the essential NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors. To assess behavioral flexibility, we used a water U-maze paradigm in which mice had to shift from an initially acquired rule to a new rule (strategy shifting) or had to reverse an initially learned rule (reversal learning). Inactivation of NMDA-receptors in all neurons of the dorsal striatum did not affect learning of the initial rule or reversal learning, but impaired shifting from one strategy to another. Strategy shifting was also compromised when NMDA-receptors were inactivated only in dynorphin-expressing neurons in the dorsal striatum, which represent the direct pathway. These data suggest that NMDA-receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity in the dorsal striatum contributes to strategy shifting and that striatal projection neurons of the direct pathway are particularly relevant for this process.

AB  - Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by synaptic loss and cognitive impairments. Although AD is the most prevalent aging-related neurodegenerative disease, therapeutic strategies remain palliative. Recent studies have shown that probucol presents neuroprotective effects in experimental models of neurodegenerative disease. The present study aimed to investigate the potential protective effects of probucol against streptozotocin (STZ)-induced cognitive impairment and hippocampal biochemical changes (oxidative stress-related parameters, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, cholesterol levels and β-secretase (BACE) protein levels) in mice. Adult Swiss mice received STZ [150 μg/bilateral, i.c.v.], and treated daily with probucol (≅10 mg/kg/day, in drinking water, for 5 weeks,). Twenty-one days after i.c.v. administrations, STZ-infused animals displayed significant deficits in cognition (evaluated in the displaced and new object recognition tasks), which were paralleled by a significant increase in hippocampal AChE activity. Moreover, STZ-infused mice showed increased levels of BACE and decreased glutathione reductase (GR) activity in the hippocampus compared with the control group. Probucol treatment significantly protected against the behavioral and hippocampal biochemical changes induced by STZ. However, it was unable to prevent STZ-induced increase of hippocampal BACE levels and did not change hippocampal cholesterol levels. It is noteworthy that probucol treatment increased the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity per se independent of STZ injection. The present findings are the first to show that i.c.v. STZ infusions are able to increase hippocampal BACE expression. Moreover, the results also show that probucol can counteract STZ-induced cognitive impairments and biochemical parameters independently of potential modulator effects toward BACE levels. The study is the first to report the protective effects of probucol against STZ-induced biochemical hippocampal changes and behavioral impairments, rendering this compound a promising molecule for further pharmacological studies on the search for therapeutic strategies to treat or prevent AD.

AB  - Abstract
It has anatomically been revealed that the rostral part of the rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1) directly projects to the dorsal part of the trigeminal oral subnucleus (dorVo) and the dorsal part of juxtatrigeminal region (dorVjuxt), and that the dorVo and dorVjuxt contain premotoneurons projecting directly to the jaw-opening or jaw-closing motoneurons in the trigeminal motor nucleus (Vmo). However, little is known about how the rostral S1 regulates jaw movements in relation to its corticofugal projections. To address this issue, we performed intracortical microstimulation of the rat rostral S1 by monitoring jaw movements and electromyographic (EMG) activities. We for the first time found that low-frequency long-train stimulation of the rostral S1 induced single sustained opening of the jaw with elevated EMG activities of the anterior digastric muscles (jaw-opener). The effective sites for the low-frequency long-train stimulation overlapped the S1 sites where traditional high-frequency short-train stimulation was effective to induce single twitch-like jaw movement. We also found that the effective sites for the two kinds of train stimuli were included in the rostral S1 area, which has previously been identified to send direct projections to the dorVo or the dorVjuxt. Specifically, the most effective stimulation sites for the two kinds of train stimuli were located in the rostralmost part of S1 which has been reported to emanate strong direct projections to the dorVjuxt but less to the dorVo. Therefore, the present study suggests that the rat rostral S1, especially its rostralmost part, plays an important role in controlling jaw movements by activation of direct descending projections from the rostral S1 to the trigeminal premotoneuron pools, especially to the dorVjuxt.

AB  - Abstract
Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) affects central autonomic neurons, including those controlling the cardiovascular system, thermogenesis, and energy balance. Preproglucagon (PPG) neurons, located mainly in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and medullary reticular formation, produce GLP-1. In transgenic mice expressing glucagon promoter-driven yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), these brainstem PPG neurons project to many central autonomic regions where GLP-1 receptors are expressed. The spinal cord also contains GLP-1 receptor mRNA but the distribution of spinal PPG axons is unknown.

Here, we used two-color immunoperoxidase labeling to examine PPG innervation of spinal segments T1–S4 in YFP-PPG mice. Immunoreactivity for YFP identified spinal PPG axons and perikarya. We classified spinal neurons receiving PPG input by immunoreactivity for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and/or Fluorogold (FG) retrogradely transported from the peritoneal cavity. FG microinjected at T9 defined cell bodies that supplied spinal PPG innervation.

The deep dorsal horn of lower lumbar cord contained YFP-immunoreactive neurons. Non-varicose, YFP-immunoreactive axons were prominent in the lateral funiculus, ventral white commissure and around the ventral median fissure. In T1–L2, varicose, YFP-containing axons closely apposed many ChAT-immunoreactive sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPN) in the intermediolateral cell column (IML) and dorsal lamina X. In the sacral parasympathetic nucleus, about 10% of ChAT-immunoreactive preganglionic neurons received YFP appositions, as did occasional ChAT-positive motor neurons throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the ventral horn. YFP appositions also occurred on NOS-immunoreactive spinal interneurons and on spinal YFP-immunoreactive neurons. Injecting FG at T9 retrogradely labeled many YFP-PPG cell bodies in the medulla but none of the spinal YFP-immunoreactive neurons.

These results show that brainstem PPG neurons innervate spinal autonomic and somatic motor neurons. The distributions of spinal PPG axons and spinal GLP-1 receptors correlate well. SPN receive the densest PPG innervation. Brainstem PPG neurons could directly modulate sympathetic outflow through their spinal inputs to SPN or interneurons.

AB  - Abstract
The mesolimbic dopamine system, originating in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and projecting to the nucleus accumbens (NAc), has been heavily implicated in the reinforcing effects of ethanol. Recent slice voltammetry studies have shown that ethanol inhibits dopamine release selectively during high-frequency activity that elicits phasic dopamine release shown to be important for learning and reinforcement. Presently, we examined ethanol inhibition of electrically evoked NAc dopamine in two mouse strains with divergent dopamine responses to ethanol, C57BL/6 (C57) and DBA/2J (DBA) mice. Previous electrophysiology and microdialysis studies have demonstrated greater ethanol-induced VTA dopaminergic firing and NAc dopamine elevations in DBA compared to C57 mice. Additionally, DBA mice have greater ethanol responses in dopamine-related behaviors, including hyperlocomotion and conditioned place preference. Currently, we demonstrate greater sensitivity of ethanol inhibition of NAc dopamine signaling in C57 compared to DBA mice. The reduced sensitivity to ethanol inhibition in DBA mice may contribute to the overall greater ethanol-induced dopamine signaling and related behaviors observed in this strain. NAc cholinergic activity is known to potently modulate terminal dopamine release. Additionally, ethanol is known to interact with multiple aspects of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor activity. Therefore, we examined ethanol-mediated inhibition of dopamine release at two ethanol concentrations (80 and 160 mM) during bath application of the non-selective nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine, as well as compounds selective for the β2-(dihydro-β-erythroidine hydrobromide; DhβE) and α6-(α-conotoxin MII [H9A; L15A]) subunit-containing receptors. Mecamylamine and DhβE decreased dopamine release and reduced ethanol’s inhibitory effects on dopamine in both DBA and C57 mice. Further, α-conotoxin also reduced the dopamine release and the dopamine-inhibiting effects of ethanol at the 80 mM, but not 160 mM, concentration. These data suggest that ethanol is acting in part through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, or downstream effectors, to reduce dopamine release during high-frequency activity.

AB  - Abstract
Converging evidence suggests that the Parkinson’s disease-linked leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) modulates cellular function by regulating actin dynamics. In the present study we investigate the role of LRRK2 in functional synaptic terminals of adult LRRK2-knockout and LRRK2(R1441G)-transgenic mice as well as in primary fibroblasts of LRRK2(G2019S) mutation carriers. We show that lack of LRRK2 decreases and overexpression of mutant LRRK2 age-dependently increases the effect of the actin depolymerizing agent Latrunculin A (LatA) on the synaptic cytoskeleton. Similarly, endogenous mutant LRRK2 increases sensitivity to LatA in primary fibroblasts. Under basal conditions however, these fibroblasts show an increase in F-actin bundles and a decrease in filopodial length which can be rescued by LatA treatment. Our data suggest that LRRK2 alters actin dynamics and F-actin structure both in brain neurons and skin fibroblasts. We hypothesize that increased F-actin bundling represents a compensatory mechanism to protect F-actin from the depolymerizing effect of mutant LRRK2 under basal conditions. Our data further indicate that LRRK2-dependent changes in the cytoskeleton might have functional consequences on postsynaptic NMDA receptor localization.

AB  - Abstract
The disruptive effects of cocaine on physiological, behavioral and genetic processes are well established. However, few studies have focused on the actions of cocaine on the adult circadian timekeeping system, and none have explored the circadian implications of long-term (weeks to months) cocaine exposure. The present study was undertaken to explore the actions of such long-term cocaine administration on core circadian parameters in mice, including rhythm period, length of the nocturnal activity period and photic entrainment. For cocaine dosing over extended periods, cocaine was provided in drinking water using continuous and scheduled regimens. The impact of chronic cocaine on circadian regulation was evidenced by disruptions of the period of circadian entrainment and intrinsic free-running circadian period. Specifically, mice under a skeleton photoperiod (1-min pulse of dim light delivered daily) receiving continuous ad libitum cocaine entrained rapidly to the light pulse at activity onset. Conversely, water controls entrained more slowly at activity offset through a process of phase-delays, which resulted in their activity rhythms being entrained 147° out of phase with the cocaine group. This pattern persisted after cocaine withdrawal. Next, mice exposed to scheduled daily cocaine presentations exhibited free-running periods under constant darkness that were significantly longer than water controls and which also persisted after cocaine withdrawal. These cocaine-induced perturbations of clock timing could produce chronic psychological and physiological stress, contributing to increased cocaine use and dependence.

AB  - Abstract
Neonatal anoxia in rodents has been used to understand brain changes and cognitive dysfunction following asphyxia. This study investigated the time-course of cellular and subcellular changes and hippocampal cell death in a non-invasive model of anoxia in neonatal rats, using Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) to reveal DNA fragmentation, Fluoro-Jade® B (FJB) to show degenerating neurons, cleaved caspase-3 immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect cells undergoing apoptosis, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to reveal fine ultrastructural changes related to cell death. Anoxia was induced by exposing postnatal day 1 (P1) pups to a flow of 100% gaseous nitrogen for 25 min in a chamber maintained at 37 °C. Control rats were similarly exposed to this chamber but with air flow instead of nitrogen. Brain changes following anoxia were evaluated at postnatal days 2, 14, 21 and 60 (P2, P14, P21 and P60). In addition, spatial reference memory following anoxia and control treatments was evaluated in the Morris water maze, starting at P60. Compared to their respective controls, P2 anoxic rats exhibited (1) higher TUNEL labeling in cornus ammonis (CA) 1 and the dentate gyrus (DG), (2) higher FJB-positive cells in the CA2–3, and (3) somato-dendritic swelling, mitochondrial injury and chromatin condensation in irregular bodies, as well as other subcellular features indicating apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy and excitotoxicity in the CA1, CA2–3 and DG, as revealed by TEM. At P14, P21 and P60, both groups showed small numbers of TUNEL-positive and FJB-positive cells. Stereological analysis at P2, P14, P21 and P60 revealed a lack of significant differences in cleaved caspase-3 IHC between anoxic and control subjects. These results suggest that the type of hippocampal cell death following neonatal anoxia is likely independent of caspase-3 activation. Neonatal anoxia induced deficits in acquisition and performance of spatial reference memory in the Morris water maze task. Compared to control subjects, anoxic animals exhibited increased latencies and path lengths to reach the platform, as well as decreased searching specifically for the platform location. In contrast, no significant differences were observed for swimming speeds and frequency within the target quadrant. Together, these behavioral results indicate that the poorer performance by anoxic subjects is related to spatial memory deficits and not to sensory or motor deficits. Therefore, this model of neonatal anoxia in rats induces hippocampal changes that result in cell losses and impaired hippocampal function, and these changes are likely related to spatial memory deficits in adulthood.

AB  - Abstract
Although morphine was previously reported to produce an instant induction of c-fos in the striatum, our recent studies have demonstrated that the expression of numerous immediate early genes (IEGs) is significantly elevated at delayed time-points (several hours) after morphine administration. To better dissect the time-course of opioid-produced IEG induction, we used in situ hybridization to examine the expression of the IEGs c-fos, zif268 and arc in the mouse forebrain at several time-points after acute morphine injection. To link drug-produced behavioral changes with the activity of specific neuronal complexes, this study was performed comparatively in the C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mouse strains, which differ markedly in their locomotor responses to opioids and opioid reward.

Our study demonstrates that morphine produces two episodes of IEG induction, which are separate in time (30 min vs. 4–6 h) and which have different neuroanatomic distribution. At 30 min, one or more IEGs were induced in circumscribed subregions of the dorsal striatum (dStr) and of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell, as well as in the lateral septum. The observed inter-strain differences in IEG expression at 30 min support earlier proposals that activation of the dorsomedial striatum may mediate morphine-elicited locomotor stimulation (both effects were present only in the C57BL/6 strain). In contrast, NAc shell activation does not appear to be linked to morphine-elicited changes in locomotor behavior. The second IEG induction (of arc and of zif268) was more widespread, involving most of the dStr and the cortex. The second IEG induction peaked earlier in the DBA/2 mice than in the C57BL/6 mice (4 h compared with 6 h) and displayed no apparent relation to locomotor behavior. This delayed episode of IEG activation, which has largely been overlooked thus far, may contribute to the development of long-term effects of opioids such as tolerance, dependence and/or addiction.

AB  - Abstract
Cholinergic activation of the medial septal area (MSA) with carbachol produces thirst, natriuresis, antidiuresis and pressor response. In the brain, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) modulates autonomic and behavioral responses. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the combination of carbachol and H2O2 injected into the MSA on water intake, renal excretion, cardiovascular responses and the activity of vasopressinergic and oxytocinergic neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic (SON) nuclei. Furthermore, the possible modulation of carbachol responses by H2O2 acting through K+ATP channels was also investigated. Male Holtzman rats (280–320 g) with stainless steel cannulas implanted in the MSA were used. The pre-treatment with H2O2 in the MSA reduced carbachol-induced thirst (7.9 ± 1.0, vs. carbachol: 13.2 ± 2.0 ml/60 min), antidiuresis (9.6 ± 0.5, vs. carbachol: 7.0 ± 0.8 ml/120 min,), natriuresis (385 ± 36, vs. carbachol: 528 ± 46 μEq/120 min) and pressor response (33 ± 5, vs. carbachol: 47 ± 3 mmHg). Combining H2O2 and carbachol into the MSA also reduced the number of vasopressinergic neurons expressing c-Fos in the PVN (46.4 ± 11.2, vs. carbachol: 98.5 ± 5.9 c-Fos/AVP cells) and oxytocinergic neurons expressing c-Fos in the PVN (38.5 ± 16.1, vs. carbachol: 75.1 ± 8.5 c-Fos/OT cells) and in the SON (57.8 ± 10.2, vs. carbachol: 102.7 ± 7.4 c-Fos/OT cells). Glibenclamide (K+ATP channel blocker) into the MSA partially reversed H2O2 inhibitory responses. These results suggest that H2O2 acting through K+ATP channels in the MSA attenuates responses induced by cholinergic activation in the same area.

AB  - Abstract
There is ample evidence that both lateral/dorsolateral periaqueductal gray (l/dlPAG) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) are essential for the regulation of the autonomic responses evoked during innate reactions to threatening stimuli. However, it is not well established to what extent the BLA regulates the upstream functional connection from the l/dlPAG. Here we evaluated the role of the BLA and its glutamatergic receptors in the cardiovascular responses induced by l/dlPAG stimulation in rats. We examined the influence of acute inhibition of the BLA, unilaterally, by injecting muscimol on the cardiovascular responses evoked by the injection of N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) into the l/dlPAG. We also evaluated the role of BLA ionotropic glutamate receptors in these responses by injecting antagonists of NMDA and AMPA/kainate receptor subtypes into the BLA. Our results show that the microinjection of NMDA in the BLA increased the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR). Injection of NMDA into the l/dlPAG caused similar increases in these variables, which was prevented by the prior injection of muscimol, a GABAA agonist, into the BLA. Moreover, injection of glutamatergic antagonists (2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (AP5) and 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX)) into the BLA reduced the increase in MAP and HR induced by l/dlPAG activation. Finally, the inhibition of the central amygdala neurons failed to reduce the cardiovascular changes induced by l/dlPAG activation. These results indicate that physiological responses elicited by l/dlPAG activation require the neuronal activity in the BLA. This ascending excitatory pathway from the l/dlPAG to the BLA might ensure the expression of the autonomic component of the defense reaction.

AB  - Abstract
Neurons in the mammalian retina expressing the photopigment melanopsin have been identified as a class of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). This discovery more than a decade ago has opened up an exciting new field of retinal research, and following the initial identification of photosensitive ganglion cells, several subtypes have been described. A number of studies have shown that ipRGCs subserve photoentrainment of circadian rhythms. They also influence other non-image forming functions of the visual system, such as the pupillary light reflex, sleep, cognition, mood, light aversion and development of the retina. These novel photosensitive neurons also influence form vision by contributing to contrast detection. Furthermore, studies have shown that ipRGCs are more injury-resistant following optic nerve injury, in animal models of glaucoma, and in patients with mitochondrial optic neuropathies, i.e., Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy and dominant optic atrophy. There is also an indication that these cells may be resistant to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Herein we provide an overview of ipRGCs and discuss the injury-resistant character of these neurons under certain pathological and experimental conditions.

AB  - Abstract
Rats with lesions of the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) reliably overconsume high concentration sucrose solution. This effect is thought to be indicative of response-perseveration or loss of behavioral control in conditions of high excitement. While these theories have anatomical and behavioral support, they have never been explicitly tested. Here, we used a contact lickometer to examine the microstructure of drinking behavior to gain insight into the behavioral changes during overconsumption. Rats received either excitotoxic (ibotenic acid) damage to all PPTg neuronal subpopulations or selective depletion of the cholinergic neuronal sub-population (diphtheria toxin–urotensin II (Dtx–UII) lesions). We offered rats a variety of pleasant, neutral and aversive tastants to assess the generalizability and specificity of the overconsumption effect. Ibotenic-lesioned rats consumed significantly more 20% sucrose than sham controls, and did so through licking significantly more times. However, the behavioral microstructure during overconsumption was unaffected by the lesion and showed no indications of response-perseveration. Furthermore, the overconsumption effect did not generalize to highly consumed saccharin. In contrast, while only consuming small amounts of quinine solution, ibotenic-lesioned rats had significantly more licks and bursts for this tastant. Selective depletion of cholinergic PPTg neurons had no effect on consumption of any tastant. We then assessed whether it is the salience of the solution which determines overconsumption by ibotenic-lesioned rats. While maintained on free-food, ibotenic-lesioned rats had normal consumption of sucrose and hypertonic saline. After mild food deprivation ibotenic PPTg-lesioned rats overconsumed 20% sucrose. Subsequently, after dietary-induced sodium deficiency, lesioned rats consumed significantly more saline than controls. These results establish that it is the salience of the solution which is the determining factor leading to overconsumption following excitotoxic PPTg lesion. They also find no support for response-perseveration contributing to this effect. Results are discussed in terms of altered dopamine (DA) and salience signaling.

AB  - Abstract
Reactive oxygen species and their detrimental effects on the brain after transient ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ischemic reperfusion injury. Thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) is an endogenous antioxidant protein that has neuroprotective effects. We hypothesized that Trx-1 plays a crucial role in regulating cerebral I/R injury. To be able to test this, 190 Sprague–Dawley rats were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) with Trx-1 siRNA (small interference RNA) injected 24 h prior to ischemia. At 24 h after tMCAO, we measured neurological deficits, infarct volume, and brain water content, and found that neurological dysfunction, brain infarct size, and brain edema were worse in the Trx-1 siRNA group than in the control group. Oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring superoxide dismutase activity and malondialdehyde level. The levels of Trx-1 and its cofactor, peroxiredoxin (Prdx), were significantly decreased after Trx-1 down-regulated. However, there is no significant difference in the Prdx mRNA level after administration of Trx-1 siRNA. In contrast, Prdx-SO3 protein levels were significantly increased in the Trx-1 siRNA group. We also investigated the specific role of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in Trx-1 induction by knocking down Nrf2. Nrf2 siRNA injection decreased Trx-1 mRNA and protein expression. Our results suggest that the exacerbation of brain damage was associated with enhanced cerebral peroxidation in brain tissues. Moreover, these results revealed that Trx-1, which is more likely regulated by Nrf2, exerts a neuroprotective role probably through maintaining the reduction activity of Prdx1–4.

AB  - Abstract
Nerve injuries cause pain, paralysis and numbness that can lead to major disability, and newborns often sustain nerve injuries during delivery that result in lifelong impairment. Without a pharmacologic agent to enhance functional recovery from these injuries, clinicians rely solely on surgery and rehabilitation to treat patients. Unfortunately, patient outcomes remain poor despite application of the most advanced microsurgical and rehabilitative techniques. We hypothesized that the detrimental effects of traumatic neonatal nerve injury could be mitigated with pharmacologic neuroprotection, and tested whether the novel neuroprotective agent P7C3 would block peripheral neuron cell death and enhance functional recovery in a rat neonatal nerve injury model. Administration of P7C3 after sciatic nerve crush injury doubled motor and sensory neuron survival, and also promoted axon regeneration in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with P7C3 also enhanced behavioral and muscle functional recovery, and reversed pathological mobilization of spinal microglia after injury. Our findings suggest that the P7C3 family of neuroprotective compounds may provide a basis for the development of a new neuroprotective drug to enhance recovery following peripheral nerve injury.

AB  - Abstract
Oxidative stress and apoptosis were induced in neuronal cultures by inhibition of glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis with d,l-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine (BSO). Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) cation channels are gated by oxidative stress. The oxidant effects of homocysteine (Hcy) may induce activation of TRPV1 and TRPM2 channels in aged mice as a model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We tested the effects of Hcy, BSO and GSH on oxidative stress, apoptosis and Ca2+ and influx via TRPM2 and TRPV1 channels in the hippocampus of mice.

Native mice hippocampal neurons were divided into five groups as follows; control, Hcy, BSO, Hcy + BSO and Hcy + BSO + GSH groups. The neurons in TRPM2 and TRPV1 experiments were stimulated by hydrogen peroxide and capsaicin, respectively. BSO and Hcy incubations increased intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations, reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, mitochondrial depolarization, and levels of caspase 3 and 9. All of these increases were reduced by GSH treatments. Treatment with 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) and N-(p-amylcinnamoyl)anthranilic acid (ACA) as potent inhibitors of TRPM2, capsazepine as a potent inhibitor of TRPV1, verapamil + diltiazem (V + D) as inhibitors of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC) and MK-801 as a N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) channel antagonist indicated that GSH depletion and Hcy elevation activated Ca2+ entry into the neurons through TRPM2, TRPV1, VGCC and NMDA channels. Inhibitor roles of 2-APB and capsazepine on the Ca2+ entry higher than in V + D and MK-801 antagonists.

In conclusion, these findings support the idea that GSH depletion and Hcy elevation can have damaging effects on hippocampal neurons by perturbing calcium homeostasis, mainly through TRPM2 and TRPV1 channels. GSH treatment can partially reverse these effects.

AB  - Abstract
Sepsis is a severe systemic inflammatory disorder that rapidly activates the sympathetic nervous system to enhance catecholamine secretion from postganglionic sympathetic neurons and adrenal chromaffin cells. Although an increase in preganglionic drive to postganglionic sympathetic tissues has been known to contribute to this response for quite some time, only recently was it determined that sepsis also has direct effects on adrenal chromaffin cell Ca2+ signaling and epinephrine release. In the present study, we characterized the direct effects of sepsis on postganglionic sympathetic neuron function. Using the endotoxemia model of sepsis in mice, we found that almost a quarter of postganglionic neurons acquired the ability to fire spontaneous action potentials, which was absent in cells from control mice. Spontaneously firing neurons possessed significantly lower rheobases and fired a greater number of action potentials at twice the rheobase compared to neurons from control mice. Sepsis did not significantly affect voltage-gated Ca2+ currents. However, global Ca2+ signaling was enhanced in postganglionic neurons isolated from 1 to 24 h endotoxemic mice. A similar increase in the amplitude of high-K+-stimulated Ca2+ transients was observed during the cecal ligation and puncture model of sepsis. The enhanced excitability and Ca2+ signaling produced during sepsis likely amplify the effect of increased preganglionic drive on norepinephrine release from postganglionic neurons. This is important, as sympathetic neurons are integral to the anti-inflammatory autonomic reflex that is activated during sepsis.

AB  - Abstract
The medial preoptic and anterior hypothalamic areas (MPO/AH) are important androgen targets regulating homeostasis, neuroendocrinology and circadian rhythm as well as instinctive and sociosexual behaviors. Although species differences between rats and mice have been pointed out in terms of morphology and physiology, detailed distributions of androgen receptor (AR) have never been compared between the two rodents. In the present study, AR distribution was examined immunohistochemically in serial sections of the MPO/AH and compared for adult rats and mice. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry clearly demonstrated that AR expression in the brain was stronger in mice than in rats and was stronger in males than in females. In addition, we found (1) an “obliquely elongated calbindin-ir cell island” in mice medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) expressed AR intensely, as well as the sexually dimorphic nucleus in the MPN (SDN–MPN) in rats, strongly supporting a “putative SDN–MPN” previously proposed in mice; (2) AR expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) was much more prominent in mice than in rats and differed in localization between the two species; (3) a mouse-specific AR-ir cell cluster was newly identified as the “tear drop nucleus (TDN)”, with male-dominant sexual dimorphism; and (4) two rat-specific AR-ir cell clusters were also newly identified as the “rostral and caudal nebular islands”, with male-dominant sexual dimorphism. The present results may provide basic morphological evidence underlying species differences in androgen-modified psychological, physiological and endocrinergic responses. Above all, the findings of the mouse-specific TDN and differing AR expression in the SCN might explain not only species difference in gonadal modification of circadian rhythm, but also distinct structural bases in the context of transduction of SCN oscillation. The current study could also serve as a caution that data on androgen-sensitive functions obtained from one species should not always be directly applied to others among rodents.

AB  - Abstract
Relaxin is an essential pregnancy-related hormone with broad peripheral effects mediated by activation of relaxin-like family peptide 1 receptors (RXFP1). More recent studies suggest an additional role for relaxin as a neuropeptide, with RXFP1 receptors expressed in numerous brain regions. Neurons in an area of the brainstem known as the nucleus incertus (NI) produce relaxin 3 (RLN3), the most recently identified neuropeptide in the relaxin family. RLN3 has been shown to activate both RXFP1 and relaxin-like family peptide receptor 3 (RXFP3) receptor subtypes. Studies suggest wide-ranging neuromodulatory effects of both RXFP1 and RXFP3 activation, although to date the majority of studies have been conducted in young males. In the current study, we examined potential sex- and age-related changes in RLN3 gene expression in the NI as well as RXFP1 and RXFP3 gene expression in the dorsal hippocampus (HI), ventral hippocampus (vHI) and amygdala (AMYG) using young adult (9–12 weeks) and middle-aged (9–12 months) male and female rats. In addition, regional changes in RXFP1 and RXFP3 protein expression were examined in the CA1, CA2/CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) as well as within basolateral (BLA), central (CeA), and medial (MeA) amygdaloid nuclei. In the NI, RLN3 showed an age-related decrease in males. In the HI, only the RXFP3 receptor showed an age-related change in gene expression, however, both receptor subtypes showed age-related changes in protein expression that were region specific. Additionally, while gene and protein expression of both receptors increased with age in AMYG, these effects were both region- and sex-specific. Finally, overall males displayed a greater number of cells that express the RXFP3 protein in all of the amygdaloid nuclei examined. Cognitive and emotional processes regulated by activity within the HI and AMYG are modulated by both sex and age. The vast majority of studies exploring the influence of sex on age-related changes in the HI and AMYG have focused on sex hormones, with few studies examining the role of neuropeptides. The current findings suggest that changes in relaxin family peptides may contribute to the significant sex differences observed in these brain regions as a function of aging.

In semantic categorization processes, individuals form a relation between perceived or imagined objects and knowledge about these objects. In the present semantic categorization study, we correlated endogenous 17-β-estradiol levels (E2) with performance as well as amplitude of theta oscillations in young women (age 23.1 ± 3.4 years). The semantic categorization task consisted of nouns representing either living or non-living items. Each item was characterized either by many or by few features. We identified parameters associated or not associated with menstrual cycle phases. Irrespective of the menstrual cycle phase, women (1) responded faster to living items as well as to nouns characterized by many features compared to non-living items and items characterized by few features, (2) showed higher accuracy to non-living items and items having many features, and (3) showed negative correlation between response time (RT) and theta amplitude. RT, accuracy and post-stimulus theta amplitude were not statistically significantly different among early follicular, late follicular or luteal women. In early follicular but not in late follicular or luteal women, we observed (1) a positive correlation between E2 and latency in RT, (2) a negative correlation between E2 and accuracy, and (3) a negative correlation between E2 and post-stimulus theta amplitude. A mosaic of menstrual cycle phase-dependent and -independent associations may indicate that a similar performance in each menstrual cycle phase is related to different modulation of synaptic activity by hormones.

AB  - Abstract
Human auditory nerve afferents consist of two separate systems; one is represented by the large type I cells innervating the inner hair cells and the other one by the small type II cells innervating the outer hair cells. Type I spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) constitute 96% of the afferent nerve population and, in contrast to other mammals, their soma and pre- and post-somatic segments are unmyelinated. Type II nerve soma and fibers are unmyelinated. Histopathology and clinical experience imply that human SGNs can persist electrically excitable without dendrites, thus lacking connection to the organ of Corti. The biological background to this phenomenon remains elusive. We analyzed the pre- and post-somatic segments of the type I human SGNs using immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in normal and pathological conditions. These segments were found surrounded by non-myelinated Schwann cells (NMSCs) showing strong intracellular expression of laminin-β2/collagen IV. These cells also bordered the perikaryal entry zone and disclosed surface rugosities outlined by a folded basement membrane (BM) expressing laminin-β2 and collagen IV. It is presumed that human large SGNs are demarcated by three cell categories: (a) myelinated Schwann cells, (b) NMSCs and (c) satellite glial cells (SGCs). Their BMs express laminin-β2/collagen IV and reaches the BM of the sensory epithelium at the habenula perforata. We speculate that the NMSCs protect SGNs from further degeneration following dendrite loss. It may give further explanation why SGNs can persist as electrically excitable monopolar cells even after long-time deafness, a blessing for the deaf treated with cochlear implantation.

AB  - Abstract
The primary vestibular neurons convey afferent information from hair cells in the inner ear to the vestibular nuclei and the cerebellum. The intrinsic firing properties of vestibular ganglion cells (VGCs) are heterogeneous to sustained membrane depolarization, and undergo marked developmental changes from phasic to tonic types during the early postnatal period. Previous studies have shown that low-voltage-activated potassium channels, Kv1 and Kv7, play a critical role in determining the firing pattern of VGCs. In the present study, we explored the developmental changes in the properties of hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih) in rat VGCs and the role played by Ih in determining the firing properties of VGCs. Tonic firing VGCs showed a larger current density of Ih as compared to phasic firing VGCs, and tonic firing VGCs became phasic firing in the presence of ZD7288, an Ih channel blocker, indicating that Ih contributes to control the firing pattern of VGCs. The amplitude of Ih increased and the activation kinetics of Ih became faster during the developmental period. Analysis of developmental changes in the expression of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated cation (HCN) channels revealed that expression of HCN1 protein and its mRNA increased during the developmental period, whereas expression of HCN2–4 protein and its mRNA did not change. Our results suggest that HCN1 channels as well as Kv1 channels are critical in determining the firing pattern of rat VGCs and that developmental up-regulation of HCN1 transforms VGCs from phasic to tonic firing phenotypes.

AB  - Abstract
Major depressive illness is among the most prevalent neuropsychiatric disorders and is associated with neuroplasticity deficits in limbic structures such as the amygdala. Since exposure to stressful life events is proposed to contribute to depressive illness, our recent studies examined the effects of stress on amygdalar neuroplasticity. These studies determined that repeated stress elicits deficits in glutamatergic activity in the amygdala, neuroplasticity deficits that can be prevented by some but not all antidepressants. In view of these observations, the goal of the current study was to determine the effects of repeated restraint stress (RRS) on the dendritic architecture of pyramidal neurons in the rat basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (CBL), as well as glutamate efflux in the CBL and central nucleus of the amygdala (CMX) via in vivo microdialysis. We also examined the ability of the antidepressant agomelatine to prevent RRS-induced neuroplasticity deficits. Compared with control rats, rats subjected to RRS exhibited atrophy of CBL pyramidal neurons, including decreases in total dendritic length, branch points, and dendritic complexity index. In addition, glutamate efflux was significantly reduced in the CMX of rats subjected to RRS, thereby identifying a potential neurochemical consequence of stress-induced dendritic atrophy of CBL pyramidal neurons. Lastly, an acute stress challenge increased corticosterone (CORT) levels in the CBL, suggesting that stress-induced increases in CORT levels may contribute to the neuroanatomical and neurochemical effects of RRS in the CBL. Importantly, these RRS-induced changes were prevented by daily agomelatine administration. These results demonstrate that the neuroanatomical and neurochemical properties of glutamatergic neurons in the rat amygdala are adversely affected by repeated stress and suggest that the therapeutic effects of agomelatine may include protection of structural and neurochemical plasticity in limbic structures like the amygdala.

AB  - AbstractRationale
Seizures during status epilepticus (SE) cause neuronal death and induce cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Pilocarpine-induced SE was used to determine if COX-2 inhibition with NS-398, when administered alone or with diazepam, decreases the duration and/or intensity of SE and/or reduces neuronal injury in the rat hippocampus.
Methods
Electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes were implanted in male Sprague–Dawley rats. SE was induced with lithium-pilocarpine, and continuous EEG and video monitoring were performed for 24 h. Rats were divided into four groups (n = 8–14 rats/group) and received NS-398, diazepam, NS-398 and diazepam, or vehicle 30 min after the first motor seizure. Six hours later, NS-398 injection was repeated in the NS-398 and in the NS-398 + diazepam groups. The duration of SE (continuous spiking) and the EEG power in the γ-band were analyzed. FluoroJade B staining in the dorsal hippocampus at 24 h after SE was analyzed semi-quantitatively in the CA1, CA3 and hilus.
Results
The duration and intensity of electrographic SE was not significantly different across the four groups. In rats treated with NS-398 alone, compared to vehicle-treated rats, neuronal damage was significantly lower compared to vehicle-treated rats in the CA3 (27%) and hilus (27%), but neuroprotection was not detected in the CA1. When NS-398 was administered with diazepam, decreased neuronal damage was further obtained in all areas investigated (CA1: 61%, CA3: 63%, hilus: 60%).
Conclusions
NS-398, when administered 30 min after the onset of SE with a repeat dose at 6 h, decreased neuronal damage in the hippocampus. Administration of diazepam with NS-398 potentiates the neuroprotective effect of the COX-2 inhibitor. These neuroprotective effects occurred with no detectable effect on electrographic SE.

AB  - Abstract
Apart from its repressing effect on plasma lipid levels, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors exert neuroprotective functions in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders. In view of these promising observations, we were interested in whether HMG-CoA reductase inhibition would affect epileptiform activity in the brain. To elucidate this issue, atorvastatin, simvastatin and rosuvastatin were administered orally at a dose of 20 mg/kg each for 3 days and their anti-epileptic activities were tested and compared in rats. Epileptiform activity in the brain was induced by an intracortical penicillin G injection. Among HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, simvastatin-treatment was less effective in terms of spike frequency as compared with atorvastatin- and rosuvastatin-treated animals. Atorvastatin treatment reduced spike frequencies and amplitudes significantly throughout the experiment. However, the most pronounced anti-epileptic effect was observed in rosuvastatin-treated animals, which was associated with improved blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity, increased expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA and decreased expressions of pro-apoptotic p53, Bax and caspase-3 mRNAs. Inhibition of eNOS activity with l-NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester (l-NAME) reversed the anti-epileptic effect of rosuvastatin significantly. However, l-NAME did not alter the effect of rosuvastatin on the levels of p53, Bax and caspase-3 mRNA expression. Here, we provide evidence that among HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, rosuvastatin was the most effective statin on the reduction of epileptiform activity, which was associated with improved BBB permeability, increased expression of eNOS and decreased expressions of pro-apoptotic p53, Bax and caspase-3. Our observation also revealed that the anti-epileptic effect of rosuvastatin was dependent on the increased expression level of eNOS. The robust anti-epileptic effect encourages proof-of-concept studies with rosuvastatin in human epilepsy patients with hypercholesterolemia.

AB  - Abstract
The cerebral cortex is an indispensable region that is involved in higher cognitive function in the mammalian brain, and is particularly evolved in the primate brain. It has been demonstrated that cortical areas are formed by both innate and activity-dependent mechanisms. However, it remains unknown what molecular changes induce cortical expansion and complexity during primate evolution. Active DNA methylation/demethylation is one of the epigenetic mechanisms that can modify gene expression via the methylation/demethylation of promoter regions. Three growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible small nuclear proteins, Gadd45 alpha, beta, and gamma, have been identified as regulators of methylation status. To understand the involvement of epigenetic factors in primate cortical evolution, we started by analyzing expression of these demethylation genes in the developing common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and mouse (Mus musculus) brain. In the marmoset brain, we found that cortical expression levels of Gadd45 alpha and gamma were reduced during development, whereas there was high expression of Gadd45 beta in some areas of the adult brain, including the prefrontal, temporal, posterior parietal and insula cortices, which are particularly expanded in greater primates and humans. Compared to the marmoset brain, there were no clear regional differences and constant or reduced Gadd45 expression was seen between juvenile and adult mouse brain. Double staining with a neuronal marker revealed that most Gadd45-expressing cells were NeuN-positive neurons. Thus, these results suggest the possibility that differential Gadd45 expression affects neurons, contributing cortical evolution and diversity.

AB  - Abstract
Feeding increases plasma osmolality and ovarian steroids may influence the balance of fluids. Vasopressin (AVP) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON) express estrogen receptor type β (ERβ), but not estrogen receptor type α (ERα). The circumventricular organs express ERα and project efferent fibers to the PVN and SON. Our aim was to assess whether interactions exist between food state-related osmolality changes and the action of estrogen on AVP neuron activity and estrogen receptor expression. We assessed plasma osmolality and AVP levels; fos-coded protein (FOS)- and AVP-immunoreactivity (-IR) and FOS-IR and ERα-IR in the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) and organ vasculosum lamina terminalis (OVLT) in estrogen-primed and unprimed ovariectomized rats under the provision of ad libitum food, 48 h of fasting, and subsequent refeeding with standard chow or sodium-free food. Refeeding with standard chow increased plasma osmolality and AVP as well as the co-expression of FOS-IR/AVP-IR in the PVN and SON. These responses were not altered by estrogen, with the exception of the decreases in FOS-IR/AVP-IR in the lateral PVN. During refeeding, estrogen modulates only a subpopulation of AVP neurons in the lateral PVN. FOS-ERα co-expression in the ventral median preoptic nucleus (vMnPO) was reduced by estrogen and increased after refeeding with standard chow following fasting.

It appears that estrogen may indirectly modulate the activity of AVP neurons, which are involved in the mechanism affected by hyperosmolality-induced refeeding after fasting. This indirect action of estrogen can be at least in part via ERα in the vMnPO.

AB  - Abstract
Connexin26 (Cx26, GJB2) mutations account for &gt;50% of nonsyndromic hearing loss. The deafness is not always congenital. A large group of these patients (∼30%) demonstrate a late-onset hearing loss, starting in childhood. They have normal hearing early in life and are therefore good candidates for applying protective and therapeutic interventions. However, the underlying deafness mechanism is unclear. In this study, we used a time-controlled, inducible gene knockout technique to knockout Cx26 expression in the cochlea after birth. We found that deletion of Cx26 after postnatal day 5 (P5) in mice could lead to late-onset hearing loss. Similar to clinical observations, the mice demonstrated progressive, mild to moderate hearing loss. The hearing loss initiated at high frequencies and then extended to the middle- and low-frequency range. The cochlea showed normal development and had no apparent hair cell loss. However, distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) was reduced. The reduction was also progressive and large at high-frequencies. Consistent with DPOAE reduction, we found that outer hair cell electromotility-associated nonlinear capacitance was shifted to the right and the slope of voltage dependence was reduced. The endocochlear potential was reduced in Cx26 conditional knockout (cKO) mice but the reduction was not associated with progressive hearing loss. These data suggest that Cx26 deficiency may impair active cochlear amplification leading to late-onset hearing loss. Our study also helps develop newer protective and therapeutic interventions to this common nonsyndromic hearing loss.

AB  - Abstract
Administration of kainic acid induces acute seizures that result in the loss of neurons, gliosis and reorganization of mossy fiber pathways in the hippocampus resembling those observed in human temporal lobe epilepsy. Although these structural changes have been well characterized, the mechanisms underlying the degeneration of neurons following administration of kainic acid remain unclear. Since the lysosomal enzymes, cathepsins B and D, are known to be involved in the loss of neurons and clearance of degenerative materials in a variety of experimental conditions, we evaluated their potential roles in kainic acid-treated rats. In parallel, we also measured the levels and expression of insulin-like growth factor-II/mannose 6-phosphate (IGF-II/M6P) receptors, which mediate the intracellular trafficking of these enzymes, in kainic acid-treated rats. Our results showed that systemic administration of kainic acid evoked severe loss of neurons along with hypertrophy of astrocytes and microglia in the hippocampus of the adult rat brain. The levels and activity of cathepsins B and D increased with time in the hippocampus of kainic acid-treated rats compared to the saline-injected control animals. The expression of both cathepsins B and D, as evident by immunolabeling studies, was also markedly increased in activated astrocytes and microglia of the kainic acid-treated rats. Additionally, cytosolic levels of the cathepsins were enhanced along with cytochrome c and to some extent Bax in the hippocampus in kainic acid-treated rats. These changes were accompanied by appearance of cleaved caspase-3-positive neurons in the hippocampus of kainic acid-treated animals. The levels of IGF-II/M6P receptors, on the other hand, were not significantly altered, but these receptors were found to be present in a subset of reactive astrocytes following administration of kainic acid. These results, taken together, suggest that enhanced levels/expression and activity of lysosomal enzymes may have a role in the loss of neurons and/or clearance of degenerative materials observed in kainic acid-treated rats.

AB  - Abstract
Previous work has implicated the transcription factor, ΔFosB, acting in the nucleus accumbens, in mediating the pro-rewarding effects of drugs of abuse such as cocaine as well as in mediating resilience to chronic social stress. However, the transgenic and viral gene transfer models used to establish these ΔFosB phenotypes express, in addition to ΔFosB, an alternative translation product of ΔFosB mRNA, termed Δ2ΔFosB, which lacks the N-terminal 78 aa present in ΔFosB. To study the possible contribution of Δ2ΔFosB to these drug and stress phenotypes, we prepared a viral vector that overexpresses a point mutant form of ΔFosB mRNA which cannot undergo alternative translation as well as a vector that overexpresses Δ2ΔFosB alone. Our results show that the mutant form of ΔFosB, when overexpressed in the nucleus accumbens, reproduces the enhancement of reward and of resilience seen with our earlier models, with no effects seen for Δ2ΔFosB. Overexpression of full length FosB, the other major product of the FosB gene, also has no effect. These findings confirm the unique role of ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens in controlling responses to drugs of abuse and stress.

AB  - Abstract
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a widely expressed neurotrophin involved in neurodevelopment, neuroprotection and synaptic plasticity. It is also implicated in a range of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Stress during adolescence/young adulthood can have long-term psychiatric and cognitive consequences, however it is unknown how altered BDNF signaling is involved in such effects. Here we investigated whether a congenital deficit in BDNF availability in rats increases vulnerability to the long-term effects of the stress hormone, corticosterone (CORT).

Compared to wildtype (WT) littermates, BDNF heterozygous (HET) rats showed higher body weights and minor developmental changes, such as reduced relative brain and pituitary weight. These animals furthermore showed deficits in short-term spatial memory in the Y-maze and in prepulse inhibition and startle, but not in object-recognition memory. CORT treatment induced impairments in novel-object recognition memory in both genotypes but disrupted fear conditioning extinction learning in BDNF HET rats only.

These results show selective behavioral changes in BDNF HET rats, at baseline or after chronic CORT treatment and add to our understanding of the role of BDNF and its interaction with stress. Importantly, this study demonstrates the utility of the BDNF HET rat in investigations into the pathophysiology of various psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Abstract
The main visual pathway that conveys motion information to the middle temporal complex (hMT+) originates from the primary visual cortex (V1), which, in turn, receives spatial and temporal features of the perceived stimuli from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). In addition, visual motion information reaches hMT+ directly from the thalamus, bypassing the V1, through a direct pathway. We aimed at elucidating whether this direct route between LGN and hMT+ represents a ‘fast lane’ reserved to high-speed motion, as proposed previously, or it is merely involved in processing motion information irrespective of speeds. We evaluated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses elicited by moving visual stimuli and applied connectivity analyses to investigate the effect of motion speed on the causal influence between LGN and hMT+, independent of V1, using the Conditional Granger Causality (CGC) in the presence of slow and fast visual stimuli. Our results showed that at least part of the visual motion information from LGN reaches hMT+, bypassing V1, in response to both slow and fast motion speeds of the perceived stimuli. We also investigated whether motion speeds have different effects on the connections between LGN and functional subdivisions within hMT+: direct connections between LGN and MT-proper carry mainly slow motion information, while connections between LGN and MST carry mainly fast motion information. The existence of a parallel pathway that connects the LGN directly to hMT+ in response to both slow and fast speeds may explain why MT and MST can still respond in the presence of V1 lesions.

AB  - Abstract
Brain iron levels are significantly increased in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and iron deposition is observed in the substantia nigra (SN) of PD patients. It is unclear whether iron overload is an initial cause of dopaminergic neuronal death or merely a byproduct that occurs in the SN of PD patients. In this study, ceruloplasmin knockout (CP−/−) mice and mice receiving an intracerebroventricular injection of ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) were selected as mouse models with high levels of brain iron. These mice were administered with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) by intraperitoneal injection. Their behavior and the dopaminergic neuron damage to their substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) were assessed. These findings suggest that the injection of FAC or the absence of the CP gene may exacerbate both the observed apoptosis of TH-positive neurons and the behavioral symptoms of the MPTP-treated mice. The intracerebroventricular injection of deferoxamine (DFO) significantly alleviated the neuronal damage caused by MPTP in CP−/− mice. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the increased nigral iron content exacerbates the oxidative stress levels, promoting apoptosis through the Bcl-2/Bax pathway and the activated caspase-3 pathway in the brain. Therefore, iron overload in the brain exacerbates dopaminergic neuronal death in SNpc and leads to the onset of PD.

AB  - Abstract
We have recently demonstrated a role of the vascular endothelium in peripheral pain mechanism by disrupting endothelial cell function using intravascular administration of octoxynol-9, a non-selective membrane active agent. As an independent test of the role of endothelial cells in pain mechanisms, we evaluated the effect of homocysteine, an agent that damages endothelial cell function. Mechanical stimulus-induced enhancement of endothelin-1 hyperalgesia in the gastrocnemius muscle of the rat was first prevented then enhanced by intravenous administration of homocysteine, but was only inhibited by its precursor, methionine. Both homocysteine and methionine significantly attenuated mechanical hyperalgesia in two models of ergonomic muscle pain, induced by exposure to vibration, and by eccentric exercise, and cutaneous mechanical hyperalgesia in an ischemia–reperfusion injury model of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome type I, all previously shown responsive to octoxynol-9. This study provides independent support for a role of the endothelial cell in pain syndromes thought to have a vascular basis, and suggests that substances that are endothelial cell toxins can enhance vascular pain.

AB  - Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) is a key retrograde messenger that regulates synaptic transmission in the cerebral cortex. However, little is known about NO-induced modulatory effects and their mechanisms relative to inhibitory synaptic transmission. The present study aimed to examine the effects of NO on unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents (uIPSCs) and to postulate the synaptic location of NO action. We performed multiple whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from rat insular cortex and divided recorded cells into three subtypes: pyramidal cells (Pyr), fast-spiking interneurons (FS), and non-FS GABAergic interneurons. In the connections from FS to Pyr (FS → Pyr), the application of S-nitroso-N-acetyl-dl-penicillamine (SNAP, 100 μM), an NO donor, suppressed uIPSC amplitudes in 31% of the connections, whereas 39% of the connections showed uIPSC facilitation. The remaining FS → Pyr connections showed little effect of SNAP on uIPSCs. An analysis of paired-pulse ratio (PPR) implied the involvement of presynaptic mechanisms in SNAP-induced effects on uIPSCs. Similar effects of SNAP were observed in FS → FS/non-FS connections; 33%, 54%, and 13% of the connections were facilitated, suppressed, and unchanged, respectively. In contrast, non-FS → Pyr or FS/non-FS showed constant uIPSC suppression by SNAP. PPR analysis supports the hypothesis that these SNAP-induced effects are mediated by presynaptic mechanisms in FS → FS/non-FS and non-FS → Pyr/FS/non-FS connections. The NO scavenger, 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazolineoxyl-1-oxyl-3-oxide (PTIO), or the inhibitor of guanylate cyclase, 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), abolished the SNAP-induced uIPSC modulation. These results suggest that NO regulation of inhibitory synaptic transmission is dependent on presynaptic cell subtypes and that, at least in part, the effects are mediated by presynaptic mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract
Phoenixin (PNX) is a 14-amino acid amidated peptide (PNX-14) or an N-terminal extended 20-residue amidated peptide (PNX-20) recently identified in neural and non-neural tissue. Mass spectrometry analysis identified a major peak corresponding to PNX-14, with negligible PNX-20, in mouse spinal cord extracts. Using a previously characterized antiserum that recognized both PNX-14 and PNX-20, PNX-immunoreactivity (irPNX) was detected in a population of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells and in cell processes densely distributed to the superficial layers of the dorsal horn; irPNX cell processes were also detected in the skin. The retrograde tracer, Fluorogold, injected subcutaneously (s.c.) to the back of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord of mice, labeled a population of DRG, some of which were also irPNX. PNX-14 (2, 4 and 8 mg/kg) injected s.c.to the nape of the neck provoked dose-dependent repetitive scratching bouts directed to the back of the neck with the hindpaws. The number of scratching bouts varied from 16 to 95 in 30 min, commencing within 5 min post-injection and lasted 10–15 min. Pretreatment of mice at −20 min with nalfurafine (20 μg/kg, s.c.), the kappa opioid receptor agonist, significantly reduced the number of bouts induced by PNX-14 (4 mg/kg) compared with that of saline-pretreated mice. Our results suggest that the peptide, PNX-14, serves as one of the endogenous signal molecules transducing itch sensation in the mouse.

AB  - Abstract
The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr) is rich in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neurons and connected to the mesencephalic tectum (MT) structures, such as the superior colliculus and dorsal periaqueductal gray matter. The SNpr presents a high density of cannabinoid receptors (CBRs), suggesting a possible regulatory role that is played by endocannabinoids (eCBs) in the ventral mesencephalon. The present study investigated the involvement of SNpr eCB mechanisms in nigrotectal pathways in the expression of defensive behavior associated with instinctive fear and panic reactions in mice that are confronted with the venomous Viperidae snake Bothrops alternatus. The localization of CB1 receptors (CB1RS) and synaptophysin glycoprotein in the SNpr was also evaluated. Administration of the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline in the MT increased defensive responses to the snake that are related to panic, such as freezing and non-oriented escape reactions, sometimes toward the snake itself. Mice that were pretreated with anandamide (5 or 50 pmol) in the SNpr, followed by an injection of physiological saline or bicuculline in the MT, exhibited significant decreases in the expression of alertness, freezing, and escape responses. Immunofluorescence showed the presence of fibers that were rich in CB1RS and synaptophysin in the SNpr, indicating that these receptors appear to be located mainly in presynaptic terminals in the striatonigral pathway. These findings suggest that eCB mechanisms in the SNpr facilitate the activity of nigrotectal GABAergic pathways, modulating the activity of striatonigral links during the elaboration and organization of innate fear and panic-like responses in threatening situations.

AB  - Abstract
When retinal ganglion cells undergo apoptosis after optic nerve (ON) injury, microglial cells proliferate and promptly clear the degenerated debris in the ipsilateral retina. However, microglial changes in the contralateral retina have not been fully elucidated. This study characterized the long-term bilateral retinal microglial responses after unilateral ON transection. We analyzed the time course of proliferation and morphology changes of microglial cells, between 3 days and 12 weeks post ON transection, of undisturbed and reactive microglia in bilateral retinas of adult Fischer rats with unilateral ON transection. Microglia in retinas without ON transection were distributed homogeneously and possessed a highly ramified morphology, as judged by immunohistochemistry for ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1). After ON transection, microglia density in the ipsilateral retina increased gradually from 3 days to 2 weeks, and decreased from 3 weeks to 12 weeks, along with dramatic inverted alteration of process branch points of microglia in the ganglion cell layer (GCL). Transformation of ramified microglia into ameboid-like macrophages with few branching processes was observed in the ipsilateral retina from 1 week to 3 weeks. Though an increase in microglial density was weak in the contralateral retina and could only be statistically detected in the central retina, the morphological alteration over time was obvious and similar to that of the ipsilateral retina. In the inner plexiform layer (IPL), cell density and morphological changes of microglia in both the ipsilateral and contralateral retina were not prominent. These findings indicates that, though proliferation of microglial cells is weak in the contralateral retina after unilateral ON transection, conspicuous alterations in microglial morphology occur bilaterally. These suggest that using the contralateral retina as a control in studies of retinal degeneration should be considered with caution.

AB  - Abstract
Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is a growth factor. GLP-1 mimetics are on the market as treatments for type 2 diabetes and are well tolerated. These drugs have shown neuroprotective properties in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, the GLP-1 mimetic exendin-4 has shown protective effects in animal models of Parkinson’s disease (PD), and a clinical trial in PD patients showed promising first results. Liraglutide and lixisenatide are two newer GLP-1 mimetics which have a longer biological half-life than exendin-4. We previously showed that these drugs have neuroprotective properties in an animal model of Alzheimer’s disease. Here we demonstrate the neuroprotective effects in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. MPTP was injected once-daily (20 mg/kg i.p.) for 7 days, and drugs were injected once-daily for 14 days i.p. When comparing exendin-4 (10 nmol/kg), liraglutide (25 nmol/kg) and lixisenatide (10 nmol/kg), it was found that exendin-4 showed no protective effects at the dose chosen. Both liraglutide and lixisenatide showed effects in preventing the MPTP-induced motor impairment (Rotarod, open-field locomotion, catalepsy test), reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels (dopamine synthesis) in the substantia nigra and basal ganglia, a reduction of the pro-apoptotic signaling molecule BAX and an increase in the anti-apoptotic signaling molecule B-cell lymphoma-2. The results demonstrate that in this study, both liraglutide and lixisenatide are superior to exendin-4, and both drugs show promise as a novel treatment of PD.

AB  - Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder with increased oxidative stress, the underlying vital process contributing to cell death. Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA), a major bioactive diterpene quinone of Salva miltiorrhiza, had been proved effective in the MPTP model through its anti-inflammatory activity. Here in this research, we found that Tan IIA prevented the loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons by activating the NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)–antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway. The cytotoxicity of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) was attenuated by the treatment of Tan IIA in SH-SY5Y cells, which significantly reduced 6-OHDA-induced lactic dehydrogenase release and reactive oxygen species production. Further study indicated that Tan IIA contributed to the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2, which bound to the ARE sequence, and activated ARE-regulated genes, including heme oxygenase-1, glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) and glutamate cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM). Tan IIA also protected against damage to mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced the translocation of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm and the activation of Caspase-9 and Caspase-3. Moreover, we demonstrated the above effects were performed in Nrf2-dependent manner. Further studies revealed that Tan IIA reduced the enhancement of miR-153 by 6-OHDA, which targeted the 3′-UTR of Nrf2, and suppressed its expression and activation. Additionally, neurodegeneration caused by in vivo stereotaxic injection of 6-OHDA could also be ameliorated by the administration of Tan IIA. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that Tan IIA may be beneficial for the treatment of PD, and also confirm that targeting the Nrf2/ARE pathway is a promising strategy for therapeutic intervention in PD.

AB  - Abstract
Recent evidence suggests that the behavioral benefits associated with voluntary wheel running in rodents may be due to modulation of glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus, a brain region implicated in learning and memory. However, the expression of the glutamatergic ionotropic N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (GluN) in the hippocampus in response to chronic sustained voluntary wheel running has not yet been investigated. Further, the developmental effects during young and mature adulthood on wheel running output and GluN expression in hippocampal subregions has not been determined, and therefore is the main focus of this investigation. Eight-week-old and 16-week-old male Wistar rats were housed in home cages with free access to running wheels and running output was monitored for 4 weeks. Wheel access was terminated and tissues from the dorsal and ventral hippocampi were processed for Western blot analysis of GluN subunit expression. Young adult runners demonstrated an escalation in running output but this behavior was not evident in mature adult runners. In parallel, young adult runners demonstrated a significant increase in total GluN (1 and 2A) subunit expression in the dorsal hippocampus (DH), and an opposing effect in the ventral hippocampus (VH) compared to age-matched sedentary controls; these changes in total protein expression were not associated with significant alterations in the phosphorylation of the GluN subunits. In contrast, mature adult runners demonstrated a reduction in total GluN2A expression in the DH, without producing alterations in the VH compared to age-matched sedentary controls. In conclusion, differential running activity-mediated modulation of GluN subunit expression in the hippocampal subregions was revealed to be associated with developmental effects on running activity, which may contribute to altered hippocampal synaptic activity and behavioral outcomes in young and mature adult subjects.

AB  - Abstract
The incidence of asthma is more common in boys than in girls during the childhood, and more common in premenopausal female than age-matched males. Our previous study demonstrated a gender difference in histamine-mediated neuroexcitability in nodose ganglia neurons (NGNs), highlighting a possibility of histamine-mediated gender difference in asthma via visceral afferent function. In the present study, we aimed to explore the gender difference in expression profiles of histamine receptors (HRs) in nodose ganglia (NG) and individual identified NGNs to provide deeper insights into the mechanisms involved in sexual dimorphism of asthma. Western-blot and SYBR green RT-PCR showed that H2R and H3R were highly expressed in NG of females compared with males and downregulated in ovariectomized females. H1R was equally expressed in NG of both sexes and not altered by ovariectomy. Furthermore, this highly expressive H2R and H3R were distributed in both myelinated and unmyelinated NGNs isolated from adult female rats by immunofluorescence and single-cell RT-PCR. H3R widely distributed in all tested neuron subtypes and its expression did not show significant difference among neuron subtypes. H2R was widely and highly expressed in low-threshold and sex-specific subpopulation of myelinated Ah-types compared with myelinated A- and unmyelinated C-type NGNs. Unexpectedly, weak expression of H1R was detected in both myelinated and unmyelinated NGNs by immunofluorescence, which was further confirmed by single-cell RT-PCR. Our results suggest that the sexual dimorphism in the expression of H2R and H3R in vagal afferents very likely contributes, at least partially, to the gender difference in prevalence and severity of asthma.

AB  - Abstract
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is the prototypic pro-inflammatory cytokine. It is central to host defense and inflammatory responses but under certain circumstances also triggers cell death and tissue degeneration. Its pleiotropic effects often lead to opposing outcomes during the development of immune-mediated diseases, particularly those affecting the central nervous system (CNS). The reported contradictions may result from lack of precision in discussing TNF. TNF signaling comprises at minimum a two-ligand (soluble and transmembrane TNF) and two-receptor (TNFR1 and TNFR2) system, with ligands and receptors both differentially expressed and regulated on different cell types. The “functional multiplicity” this engenders is the focus of much research, but there is still no general consensus on functional outcomes of TNF signaling in general, let alone in the CNS. In this review, evidence showing the effects of TNF in the CNS under physiological and pathophysiological conditions is placed in the context of major advances in understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern TNF function in general. Thus the roles of TNF signaling in the CNS shift from the conventional dichotomy of beneficial and deleterious, that mainly explain effects under pathological conditions, to incorporate a growing number of “essential” and “desirable” roles for TNF and its main cellular source in the CNS, microglia, under physiological conditions including regulation of neuronal activity and maintenance of myelin. An improved holistic view of TNF function in the CNS might better reconcile the expansive experimental data with stark clinical evidence that reduced functioning of TNF and its dominant pro-inflammatory receptor, TNFR1, are risk factors for the development of multiple sclerosis. It will also facilitate the safe translation of basic research findings from animal models to humans and propel the development of more selective anti-TNF therapies aimed at selectively inhibiting deleterious effects of this cytokine while maintaining its essential and desirable ones, in the periphery and the CNS.

AB  - Abstract
Our study examined how different housing conditions modulated the acquisition of a spatial reference memory task and also, a reversal task in the 4-radial arm water maze (4-RAWM). The animals were randomly assigned to standard or enriched cages, and, as a type of complementary stimulation along with the environmental enrichment (EE), a group of rats also ran 15 min/day in a Rotarod. Elevated-zero maze results allowed us to discard that our exercise training increased anxiety-related behaviors. 4-RAWM results revealed that the non-enriched group had a worse performance during the acquisition and also, during the first trial of each session with respect to the enriched groups. Regarding the reversal task, this group made more perseverative errors in the previous platform position. Interestingly, we hardly found differences between the two enriched groups (with and without exercise). We also analyzed how the reversal learning, depending on the previous housing condition, modulated the expression of c-Fos-positive nuclei in different subdivisions of the medial prefrontal cortex (cingulate (Cg), prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) cortices) and in the orbitofrontal (OF) cortex. The enriched groups had higher c-Fos expression in the Cg and OF cortices and lower in the IL cortex respect to the non-enriched animals. In the PL cortex, we did not find significant differences between the groups that performed the reversal task. Therefore, our short EE protocol improved the performance in a spatial memory and a reversal task, whereas the exercise training, combined with the EE, did not produce a greater benefit. This better performance seemed to be related with the specific pattern of c-Fos expression in brain regions involved in cognitive flexibility.

AB  - Abstract
Circadian clocks drive daily rhythms in physiology and behavior which allow organisms to anticipate predictable daily changes in the environment. In most mammals, circadian rhythms result in nocturnal activity patterns although plasticity of the circadian system allows activity patterns to shift to different times of day. Such plasticity is seen when food access is restricted to a few hours during the resting (light) phase resulting in food anticipatory activity (FAA) in the hours preceding food availability. The mechanisms underlying FAA are unknown but data suggest the involvement of the reward system and homeostatic regulation of metabolism. We previously demonstrated the isolated effect of metabolism by inducing diurnality in response to energetic challenges. Here the importance of reward timing in inducing daytime activity is assessed.

The daily activity distribution of mice earning palatable chocolate at their preferred time by working in a running wheel was compared with that of mice receiving a timed palatable meal at noon. Mice working for chocolate (WFC) without being energetically challenged increased their total daily activity but this did not result in a shift to diurnality. Providing a chocolate meal at noon each day increased daytime activity, identifying food timing as a factor capable of altering the daily distribution of activity and rest. These results show that timing of food reward and energetic challenges are both independently sufficient to induce diurnality in nocturnal mammals. FAA observed following timed food restriction is likely the result of an additive effect of distinct regulatory pathways activated by energetic challenges and food reward.

AB  - Abstract
Despite ample evidence of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor dysfunction in schizophrenia, no study has addressed the effects of enriched environment (EE) on sensorimotor gating deficits induced by postnatal NMDA receptor blockade. We evaluated the effect of EE on sensorimotor gating (measured by prepulse inhibition, PPI), or on sensorimotor gating deficit induced by the NMDA receptor antagonist (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate (MK-801) in both sexes of Wistar rats. Rats were injected with MK-801 (1 mg/kg) on postnatal days (P) 6–10. EE was provided from birth up to the time of experiments on P28–30 or P58–60. PPI data were collected at three prepulse intensities and then averaged to yield global PPI.

MK-801 treatment reduced PPI significantly in both sexes. While EE per se had no significant effect on PPI, it restored MK-801-induced PPI deficit only in male rats. An extended period of EE did not influence PPI deficit in female rats. Our results indicate that postnatal exposure to MK-801 may exert long-lasting effects on neuronal circuits underlying sensorimotor gating. Sex-specific modulation of such effects by EE suggests sexually dimorphic mechanisms are involved.

AB  - Abstract
Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) constitute 95% of neurons in the dorsal striatum subdivided into direct (striatonigral) and indirect (striatopallidal) pathways. Whereas D1 and D2 receptors and several neuropeptides, including dynorphin and enkephalin, are differentially expressed in these neurons, 5-hydroxytryptamine 6 receptors (5-HT6) are expressed in both pathways. Previous results demonstrate that concurrent 5-HT6 receptor overexpression in MSNs of both pathways in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) interferes with instrumental learning and that 5-HT6 overexpression in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) relieves rats from inflexible habitual behaviors. We hypothesized that 5-HT6 receptor-mediated co-activation of both pathways interferes with the differential activation/inhibition of direct/indirect pathways by dopamine. To test this idea, we cloned novel viral vectors to selectively overexpress 5-HT6 receptors in direct or indirect pathway MSNs to deconstruct their role in modulating instrumental learning and habitual responding. We found that increasing 5-HT6 receptor expression in either direct or indirect pathway MSNs of the posterior DMS selectively enhanced or impaired initial acquisition of a discrete instrumental learning task respectively, though all rats were ultimately able to learn the task. In a separate set of experiments, 5-HT6 receptor overexpression in indirect pathway MSNs of the DLS facilitated behavioral flexibility in rats overtrained on a repetitive pressing task using a variable interval schedule of reinforcement, during an omission contingency training session and subsequent probe testing. Together these findings further the notion that 5-HT6 signaling causes balanced activation of opposing MSN pathways by serotonin in sub-regions of the dorsal striatum allowing for more reflective modalities of behavior.

AB  - Abstract
The pathogenesis of pain in chronic pancreatitis is poorly understood, and its treatment can be a major clinical challenge. Surgical and other invasive methods have variable outcomes that can be unsatisfactory. Therefore, there is a great need for further discovery of the pathogenesis of pancreatitis pain and new therapeutic targets. Human and animal studies indicate a critical role for oxidative stress and activation of transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel subfamily members TRPV1 and TRPA1 on pancreatic nociceptors in sensitization mechanisms that result in pain. However, the in vivo role of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 4 (TRPV4) in chronic pancreatitis needs further evaluation. The present study characterized a rat alcohol/high fat diet (AHF)-induced chronic pancreatitis model with hypersensitivity, fibrotic pathology, and fat vacuolization consistent with the clinical syndrome. The rats with AHF-induced pancreatitis develop referred visceral pain-like behaviors, i.e. decreased hindpaw mechanical thresholds and shortened abdominal and hindpaw withdrawal latency to heat. In this study, oxidative stress was characterized as well as the role of TRPV4 in chronic visceral hypersensitivity. Lipid peroxidase and oxidative stress were indicated by increased plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and diminished pancreatic manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). The secondary sensitization associated with AHF-induced pancreatitis was effectively alleviated by the TRPV4 antagonist, HC 067047. Similarity of the results to those with the peripherally restricted μ-opiate receptor agonist, loperamide, suggested TRPV4 channel activated peripheral sensitization. This study using a reliable model that provides pre-clinical correlates of human chronic pancreatitis provides further evidence that TRPV4 channel is a potential therapeutic target for treatment of pancreatitis pain.

AB  - Abstract
Ataxia is the predominant clinical manifestation of cerebellar dysfunction. Mutations in the human CACNA1A gene, encoding the pore-forming α1 subunit of CaV2.1 (P/Q-type) calcium channels, underlie several neurological disorders, including Episodic Ataxia type 2 and Familial Hemiplegic Migraine type 1 (FHM1).

Several mouse mutants exist that harbor mutations in the orthologous Cacna1a gene. The spontaneous Cacna1a mutants Rolling Nagoya (tgrol), Tottering (tg) and Leaner (tgln) mice exhibit behavioral motor phenotypes, including ataxia. Transgenic knock-in (KI) mouse strains with the human FHM1 R192Q and S218L missense mutations have been generated. R192Q KI mice are non-ataxic, whereas S218L KI mice display a complex behavioral phenotype that includes cerebellar ataxia.

Given the dependence of γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor subunit functioning on localized calcium currents, and the functional link between GABAergic inhibition and ataxia, we hypothesized that cerebellar GABAA receptor expression is differentially affected in Cacna1a mutants and contributes to the ataxic phenotype. Herein we quantified functional GABAA receptors and pharmacologically dissociated cerebellar GABAA receptors in several Cacna1a mutants. We did not identify differences in the expression of GABAA receptor subunits or in the number of functional GABAA receptors in the non-ataxic R192Q KI strain. In contrast, tgrol mice had a ∼15% decrease in the number of functional GABAA receptors, whereas S218L KI mice showed a ∼29% increase. Our data suggest that differential changes in cerebellar GABAA receptor expression profile may contribute to the neurological phenotype of cerebellar ataxia and that targeting GABAA receptors might represent a feasible complementary strategy to treat cerebellar ataxia.

AB  - Abstract
Memory formation is a protracted process in which recently acquired events are consolidated to produce stable and specific associations. Initially, newly acquired information undergoes cellular consolidation in the hippocampus, which transiently supports the storage of recently acquired memories. In contrast, remote, or “old” memories are maintained in the cortex and show almost complete independence from the hippocampus. Memories are transferred from the hippocampus to the cortex through a process termed systems consolidation. Emerging evidence suggests that recurrent activation, or “training” of the cortex by the hippocampus is vital to systems consolidation. This process involves prolonged waves of memory-related gene activity in the hippocampus and cortex long after the learning event has terminated. Indeed, molecular events occurring within hours and days of fear conditioning are essential for stabilizing and eventually transitioning the memory to the cortex. It is increasingly evident that molecular mechanisms that exhibit a capacity for prolonged activation may underlie systems consolidation. Processes that have the capacity to control protein abundance over long time scales, such as epigenetic modifications, are prime candidates for the molecular mechanism of systems consolidation. Indeed, recent work has established two types of epigenetic modifications as integral for systems consolidation. First, localized nucleosomal histone variant exchange and histone modifications are integral for early stages of systems consolidation, whereas DNA methylation appears to be utilized to form stable marks that support memory maintenance. Since systems consolidation also requires discrete and time-sensitive changes in protein abundance, additional mechanisms, such as protein degradation, need also be considered, although their role in systems consolidation has yet to be investigated. Here, we discuss the role of molecular mechanisms in systems consolidation and their implications for understanding how memories persist over time.

Neuroplasticity involves molecular and structural changes in central nervous system (CNS) throughout life. The concept of neural organization allows for remodeling as a compensatory mechanism to the early pathobiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in an attempt to maintain brain function and cognition during the onset of dementia. The hippocampus, a crucial component of the medial temporal lobe memory circuit, is affected early in AD and displays synaptic and intraneuronal molecular remodeling against a pathological background of extracellular amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition and intracellular neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) formation in the early stages of AD. Here we discuss human clinical pathological findings supporting the concept that the hippocampus is capable of neural plasticity during mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD and early stage AD.

AB  - Abstract
Human age-related retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), are intimately associated with decreased tissue oxygenation and hypoxia. Different antioxidants have been investigated to reverse AMD. In the present study, we describe the antioxidant 17β-estradiol (βE2) and investigate its protective effects on retinal neurons. Fourteen days after ovariectomy, adult Sprague–Dawley rats were exposed to 8000-lux light for 12 h to induce retinal degeneration. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were assessed by confocal fluorescence microscopy using 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and antioxidant enzyme mRNA expression were detected by real-time PCR. Western blotting was used to evaluate NRF2 activation. NRF2 translocation was determined by immunohistochemistry, with morphological changes monitored by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Following light exposure, βE2 significantly reduced ROS production. βE2 also up-regulated NRF2 mRNA and protein levels, with maximal expression at 4 and 12 h post-exposure, respectively. Interestingly, following βE2 administration, NRF2 was translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, primarily in the outer nuclear layer. βE2 also up-regulated NRF2, which triggered phase-2 antioxidant enzyme expression (superoxide dismutases 1 and 2, catalase, glutaredoxins 1 and 2, and thioredoxins 1 and 2), reduced ROS production, and ameliorated retinal damage. However, the beneficial effects of βE2 were markedly suppressed by pretreatment with LY294002 or ICI182780, specific inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase–Akt (PI3K/AKT), and estrogen receptor (ER) signaling pathways, respectively. Taken together, these observations suggest that βE2 exerts antioxidative effects following light-induced retinal degeneration potentially via NRF2 activation. This protective mechanism may depend on two pathways: a rapid, non-genomic-type PI3K/AKT response, and a genomic-type ER-dependent response. Our data provide evidence that βE2 is a potentially effective in the treatment of retinal degeneration diseases.

AB  - Abstract
The subplate is a transient layer between the cortical plate and intermediate zone in the developing cortex. Thalamo-cortical axons form temporary synapses on subplate neurons (SPns) before invading the cortical plate. Neuronal activity within the subplate is of critical importance for the development of neocortical circuits and architecture. Although both glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs on SPns were reported, short-term plasticity of GABAergic transmission has not been investigated yet. GABAergic postsynaptic currents (GPSCs) were recorded from SPns in coronal neocortical slices prepared from postnatal day 3–4 mice using whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Evoked GPSCs (eGPSCs) elicited by electrical paired-pulse stimulation demonstrated paired-pulse depression at all interstimulus intervals tested. Baclofen, a specific GABAB receptor (GABABR) agonist, reduced eGPSC amplitudes and increased paired-pulse ratio (PPR), suggesting presynaptic location of functional GABABRs. Baclofen-induced effects were alleviated by (2S)-3-[[(1S)-1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]amino-2-hydroxypropyl](phenylmethyl)phosphinic acid (CGP55845), a selective GABABR blocker. Moreover, CGP55845 increased eGPSC amplitudes and decreased PPR even under control conditions, indicating that GABABRs are tonically activated by ambient GABA. Because extracellular GABA concentration is mainly regulated by GABA transporters (GATs), we asked whether GATs release GABA. 1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-1-[2-[[(diphenylmethylene)amino]oxy]ethyl]-3-pyridinecarboxylic acid (NNC-711) (10 μM), a selective GAT-1 blocker, increased eGPSC decay time, decreased eGPSC amplitudes and PPR. The two last effects but not the first one were blocked by CGP55845, indicating that GAT-1 blockade causes an elevation of extracellular GABA concentration and in turn activation of extrasynaptic GABAARs and presynaptic GABABRs. 1-[2-[tris(4-methoxyphenyl)methoxy]ethyl]-(S)-3-piperidinecarboxylic acid (SNAP-5114), a specific GAT-2/3 blocker, failed to affect eGPSC kinetics. However, in contrast to NNC-711 SNAP-5114 increased eGPSC amplitudes and decreased PPR. In the presence of SNAP-5114 CGP55845 did not influence GABAergic transmission, indicating that GABABRs are not activated any longer. We conclude that in the subplate GAT-2/3 operates in reverse mode. GABA released via GAT-2/3 activates presynaptic GABABRs on GABAergic synapses and tonically inhibits GABAergic inputs on SPns.

AB  - Abstract
Background: The potential of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) for studying, and inducing, functionally relevant neuroplasticity is dependent on protocols that can induce lasting, robust and reliable effects. A current limiting factor is the large inter- and intra-subject variability in NIBS-induced neuroplastic responses. There has been some study of inter-subject response variability and factors that contribute to it; however, intra-subject response variability has, so far, received little investigation. Objectives: By testing participants on multiple occasions we aimed to (1) compare inter- and intra-subject variability of neuroplastic responses induced by continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS); (2) determine whether the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) intensity used to measure cTBS-induced neuroplastic responses contributes to response variability; (3) determine whether assessment of factors known to influence response variability can be used to explain some of the variability in cTBS-induced neuroplastic responses across experimental sessions. Methods: In three separate experimental sessions, motor-evoked potential (MEP) input–output (IO) curves were obtained before and after cTBS, and questionnaire-based assessments of physical activity and perceived stress were obtained. Results: cTBS-induced MEP suppression was greatest at the upper end of the IO curve (150–180% resting motor threshold; RMT) and most consistent across subjects and across experimental sessions when assessed with a TMS intensity of 150% RMT. The magnitude of cTBS-induced MEP suppression evoked at 150% RMT correlated with self-reported perceived stress, but not with self-reported physical activity. Conclusions: The most reliable TMS intensity to probe cTBS-induced long-term depression (LTD)-like neuroplastic responses is 150% RMT. This is unlikely to simply be a ceiling effect and, we suggest, may be due to changes in the descending volley evoked at higher stimulus intensities. The perceived stress scale appears to be sufficiently sensitive to measure the influence of subject stress on LTD-like neuroplastic responses.

AB  - Abstract
The immune response is an important component of the cochlear response to stress. As an important player in the cochlear immune system, the basilar membrane immune cells reside on the surface of the scala tympani side of the basilar membrane. At present, the immune cell properties in this region and their responses to stress are not well understood. Here, we investigated the functional role of these immune cells in the immune response to acoustic overstimulation. This study reveals that tissue macrophages are present in the entire length of the basilar membrane under steady-state conditions. Notably, these cells in the apical and the basal sections of the basilar membrane display distinct morphologies and immune protein expression patterns. Following acoustic trauma, monocytes infiltrate into the region of the basilar membrane, and the infiltrated cells transform into macrophages. While monocyte infiltration and transformation occur in both the apical and the basal sections of the basilar membrane, only the basal monocytes and macrophages display a marked increase in the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II and class II transactivator (CIITA), a MHC II production cofactor, suggesting the site-dependent activation of antigen-presenting function. Consistent with the increased expression of the antigen-presenting proteins, CD4+ T cells, the antigen-presenting partner, infiltrate into the region of the basilar membrane where antigen-presenting proteins are upregulated. Further pathological analyses revealed that the basal section of the cochlea displays a greater level of sensory cell damage, which is spatially correlated with the region of antigen-presenting activity. Together, these results suggest that the antigen-presenting function of the mononuclear phagocyte population is activated in response to acoustic trauma, which could bridge the innate immune response to adaptive immunity.

AB  - Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains exhibit plaques and tangles in association with inflammation. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abl is linked to neuro-inflammation in AD. Abl inhibition by nilotinib or bosutinib facilitates amyloid clearance and may decrease inflammation. Transgenic mice that express Dutch, Iowa and Swedish APP mutations (TgAPP) and display progressive Aβ plaque deposition were treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to determine pre-plaque effects on systemic and CNS inflammation using milliplex® ELISA. Plaque Aβ was detected at 4 months in TgAPP and pre-plaque intracellular Aβ accumulation (2.5 months) was associated with changes of cytokines and chemokines prior to detection of glial changes. Plaque formation correlated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1α, IL-1β) and markers of immunosuppressive and adaptive immunity, including, IL-4, IL-10, IL-2, IL-3, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and IFN-γ. An inverse relationship of chemokines was observed as CCL2 and CCL5 were lower than WT mice at 2 months and significantly increased after plaque appearance, while soluble CX3CL1 decreased. A change in glial profile was only robustly detected at 6 months in Tg-APP mice and TKIs reduced astrocyte and dendritic cell number with no effects on microglia, suggesting alteration of brain immunity. Nilotinib decreased blood and brain cytokines and chemokines and increased CX3CL1. Bosutinib increased brain and blood IL-10 and CX3CL1, suggesting a protective role for soluble CX3CL1. Taken together these data suggest that TKIs regulate systemic and CNS immunity and may be useful treatments in early AD through dual effects on amyloid clearance and immune modulation.

AB  - Abstract
The blockade of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) with the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol significantly reduces hypertonic NaCl and water intake by sodium-depleted rats. In the present study we investigated the effects of previous injection of losartan, an angiotensin II type-1 (AT1) receptor antagonist, into the CeA on 0.3 M NaCl and water intake reduced by muscimol bilaterally injected into the same areas in rats submitted to water deprivation–partial rehydration (WD–PR) and in rats treated with the diuretic furosemide (FURO). Male Sprague–Dawley rats with stainless steel cannulas bilaterally implanted into the CeA were used. Bilateral injections of muscimol (0.2 nmol/0.5 μl, n = 8 rats/group) into the CeA in WD–PR-treated rats reduced 0.3 M NaCl intake and water intake, and pre-treatment of the CeA with losartan (50 μg/0.5 μl) reversed the inhibitory effect of muscimol. The negative effect of muscimol on sodium and water intake could also be blocked by pretreatment with losartan microinjected into the CeA in rats given FURO (n = 8 rats/group). However, bilateral injections of losartan (50 μg/0.5 μl) alone into the CeA did not affect the NaCl or water intake. These results suggest that the deactivation of CeA facilitatory mechanisms by muscimol injection into the CeA is promoted by endogenous angiotensin II acting on AT1 receptors in the CeA, which prevents rats from ingesting large amounts of hypertonic NaCl and water.

AB  - Abstract
Exposure to an immune challenge during peripuberty/adolescence, but not in adulthood, can cause enduring alterations in reproductive and non-reproductive behaviors. This suggests that the peripubertal/adolescent brain might respond differently to a stressor, like an immune challenge, than the adult brain. The goal of this study was to examine whether there are age and sex differences in the acute response to an immune challenge. To examine this research question, we investigated c-Fos expression in various brain regions. Corticosterone (CORT) concentration in the serum was quantified to examine hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA-axis) responsiveness. Results showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS; a bacterial endotoxin) treatment, induced a significant increase in the number of c-Fos immunoreactive cells in adult male and female mice compared to their saline controls. However, in peripubertal/adolescent mice, LPS treatment failed to increase the number of c-Fos immunoreactive cells in both male and female mice compared to their saline controls. LPS treatment also significantly increased serum CORT concentration in all mice regardless of sex and age. However, adult female mice treated with LPS showed significantly greater serum CORT concentration compared to adult and peripubertal/adolescent males and peripubertal/adolescent females treated with LPS. These findings support our hypothesis and suggest that there are important age and sex differences in acute immune response, which may allude to mechanisms for the enduring behavioral alterations, observed previously in mice exposed to an immune challenge during puberty but not in adulthood.

AB  - Abstract
Despite the ongoing fundamental controversy about the physiological function of sleep, there is general consensus that sleep benefits neuronal plasticity, which ultimately supports brain function and cognition. In agreement with this are numerous studies showing that sleep deprivation (SD) results in learning and memory impairments. Interestingly, such impairments appear to occur particularly when these learning and memory processes require the hippocampus, suggesting that this brain region may be particularly sensitive to the consequences of sleep loss. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying sleep and memory formation remain to be investigated, available evidence suggests that SD may impair hippocampal neuronal plasticity and memory processes by attenuating intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling which may lead to alterations in cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)-mediated gene transcription, neurotrophic signaling, and glutamate receptor expression. When restricted sleep becomes a chronic condition, it causes a reduction of hippocampal cell proliferation and neurogenesis, which may eventually lead to a reduction in hippocampal volume. Ultimately, by impairing hippocampal plasticity and function, chronically restricted and disrupted sleep contributes to cognitive disorders and psychiatric diseases.

AB  - Abstract
Previous literature suggests that free access to a running wheel can attenuate the behavioral responsiveness to addictive drugs in rodents. In a few studies, wheel-running cessation accentuated drug responsiveness. Here, we tested whether free wheel-running cessation is followed by (1) an accentuation or (2) an attenuation of cocaine psychomotor sensitization, knowing that no cessation of (continuous) wheel-running is associated with an attenuation of cocaine responsiveness. Male C57BL/6J mice, aged 35 days, were housed singly either with (exercising mice) or without (non-exercising mice) a running wheel. At the end of a period of 36 days, half of the exercising mice were deprived of their wheel whereas the other half of exercising mice kept their wheel until the end of experimentation (which lasted 85 days). The non-exercising mice were housed without wheel throughout experimentation. Testing took place 3 days after exercise cessation. After 2 once-daily drug-free test sessions, mice were tested for initiation of psychomotor sensitization over 13 once-daily injections of 8 mg/kg cocaine. Post-sensitization conditioned activation (saline challenge) and long-term expression of sensitization were assessed 2 or 30 days after the last sensitizing injection (same treatments as for initiation of sensitization), respectively. Exercising mice and mice undergoing wheel-running cessation exhibited comparable degrees of attenuation of all cocaine effects in comparison with the continuously non-exercising mice, which showed the greatest effects. Thus, the efficaciousness of wheel-running at attenuating cocaine sensitization not only resisted to exercise cessation but was also unambiguously persistent (an important effect rarely reported in previous literature).

AB  - Abstract
Trefoil factor 1 (TFF1) belongs to a family of secreted peptides that are mainly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract. Notably, TFF1 has been suggested to operate as a neuropeptide, however, its specific cellular expression, regulation and function remain largely unknown.

We have previously shown that TFF1 is expressed in developing and adult rat ventral mesencephalic tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (TH-ir) dopaminergic neurons. Here, we investigated the expression of TFF1 in rat ventral mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons (embryonic day 14) grown in culture for 5, 7 or 10 days in the absence (controls) or presence of either glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), Forskolin or the combination. No TFF1-ir cells were identified at day 5 and only a few at day 7, whereas TH was markedly expressed at both time points. At day 10, several TFF1-ir cells were detected, and their numbers were significantly increased after the addition of GDNF (2.2-fold) or Forskolin (4.1-fold) compared to controls. Furthermore, the combination of GDNF and Forskolin had an additive effect and increased the number of TFF1-ir cells by 5.6-fold compared to controls. TFF1 expression was restricted to neuronal cells, and the percentage of TH/TFF1 co-expressing cells was increased to the same extent in GDNF and Forskolin-treated cultures (4-fold) as compared to controls. Interestingly, the combination of GDNF and Forskolin resulted in a significantly increased co-expression (8-fold) of TH/TFF1, which could indicate that GDNF and Forskolin targeted different subpopulations of TH/TFF1 neurons. Short-term treatment with Forskolin resulted in an increased number of TFF1-ir cells, and this effect was significantly reduced by the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 or the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89, suggesting that Forskolin induced TFF1 expression through diverse signaling pathways.

In conclusion, distinct populations of cultured dopaminergic neurons express TFF1, and their numbers can be increased by factors known to influence survival and differentiation of dopaminergic cells.

AB  - Abstract
Abnormal accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ), α-synuclein (α-syn), and microtubule-associated protein tau (tau) have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Pick’s disease (PiD). The mechanisms through which aggregated versions of α-syn, Aβ, and tau may lead to neurodegeneration are not entirely clear, however, there is emerging evidence that neuronal calcium dysregulation is at play. Two-photon microscopy is a powerful tool that can be used to measure in vivo alterations of calcium transients using animal models of neurodegeneration, and when coupled with statistical methods to characterize functional signals, can reveal features that identify and discern between distinct mouse types. We studied four mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases, wild-type (WT) α-syn, E57K α-syn, amyloid precursor protein (APP), and triple-repeat (3R)-Tau and Non-transgenic (tg) littermates using two-photon microscopy. We found that for calcium transients, simple measures such as area under the curve (AUC) and peak width in the 1-Hz whisker pad stimulation paradigm, were significantly increased for WT α-syn, E57K α-syn and APP mice across all cortical depths compared to Non-tg mice. A similar result was found in the 3-Hz paradigm in E57K α-syn mice. Spontaneous calcium transient AUC was significantly higher in WT α-syn mice and lower for APP and 3R Tau mice at 150-μm depth. Going beyond simple measure differences such as group means for AUC, signal peak width, and spontaneous calcium activity counts, we built statistical classifiers to characterize neuronal calcium signals to identify and discern, with quantified measures of confidence, all mouse types. We tested our classifier with FK506, which regulates mitochondrial calcium and found that this drug modulated the WT α-syn calcium transients to such an extent that the classifier easily identified the calcium transients as belonging to Non-tg mice. The coupling of two-photon microscopy data and statistical classifiers serves to effectively create a bioassay where the number of animals and scientific resources can be reduced without compromising the results of the experiment.

AB  - Abstract
Acrylamide (ACR) is an industrial pollutant, to which humans are exposed through chemicals associated with day to day human life and contributes to neurological disorders. The role of reactive gliosis upon toxic insults remains paradoxical, and the immunomodulatory events during ACR intoxication remain obscure. In view of this, the present study investigated ACR-induced (20 mg/kg b.wt for 4 weeks) neurodegeneration in the context of oxidative stress and associated inflammatory events and the ability of farnesol, a sesquiterpene, to mitigate reactive gliosis in the brain of Swiss albino mice. Farnesol supplementation (100 mg/kg b.wt.) showed a marked improvement in gait performance, neuromuscular function and fine motor coordination and attenuated ACR-induced diminution in glutathione (GSH) with parallel reduction in lipid peroxidation (LPO), protein carbonyls, hydroxide, hydroperoxide and nitrite levels. Farnesol treatment significantly ameliorated ACR-mediated histological aberrations and reactive gliosis by downregulating Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and Ionizsed calcium-binding adapter molecule-1 ​(Iba-1) in the cortex, hippocampus and striatum. Further, ACR stimulated increase in levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were considerably decreased by farnesol. In conclusion, our findings indicate that farnesol exerts neuroprotective efficacy during ACR-induced neuropathology by suppressing reactive gliosis and associated inflammatory events.

AB  - Abstract
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is abundantly expressed by both developing and adult rat visceral sensory neurons from the nodose ganglion (NG) in vivo and in vitro. We have previously shown that BDNF is released from neonatal NG neurons by activity and regulates dendritic development in their postsynaptic targets in the brainstem. The current study was carried out to examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms of activity-dependent BDNF expression in neonatal rat NG neurons, using our established in vitro model of neuronal activation by electrical field stimulation with patterns that mimic neuronal activity in vivo.

We show that BDNF mRNA (transcript 4) increases over threefold in response to a 4-h tonic or bursting pattern delivered at the frequency of 6 Hz, which corresponds to the normal heart rate of a newborn rat. No significant increase in BDNF expression was observed following stimulation at 1 Hz. The latter effect suggests a frequency-dependent mechanism of regulated BDNF expression. In addition to BDNF transcript 4, which is known to be regulated by activity, transcript 1 also showed significant upregulation. The increases in BDNF mRNA were followed by BDNF protein upregulation of a similar magnitude after 24 h of stimulation at 6 Hz. Electrical stimulation-evoked BDNF expression was inhibited by pretreating neurons with the blocker of voltage-gated sodium channels tetrodotoxin and by removing extracellular calcium. Moreover, our data show that repetitive stimulation-evoked BDNF expression requires calcium influx through N-, but not L-type, channels.

Together, our study reveals novel mechanisms through which electrical activity stimulates de novo synthesis of BDNF in sensory neurons, and points to the role of N-type calcium channels in regulating BDNF expression in sensory neurons in response to repetitive stimulation.

AB  - Abstract
Numerous clinical investigations have reported that children with cerebral palsy (CP) have tactile discrimination deficits that likely limit their ability to plan and manipulate objects. Despite this clinical awareness, we still have a substantial knowledge gap in our understanding of the neurological basis for these tactile discrimination deficits. Previously, we have shown that children with CP have aberrant theta–alpha (4–14 Hz) oscillations in the somatosensory cortices following tactile stimulation of the foot. In this investigation, we evaluated if these aberrant theta–alpha oscillations also extend to the hand. Magnetoencephalography was used to evaluate event-related changes in the theta–alpha and beta (18–34 Hz) somatosensory cortical oscillations in groups of children with CP and typically developing (TD) children following tactile stimulation of their hands. Our results showed that the somatosensory theta–alpha oscillations were relatively intact in children with CP, which is in contrast to our previous results for foot tactile stimulations. We suspect that these inter-study differences may be related to the higher probability that the neural tracts serving the lower extremities are damaged in children with CP, compared to those serving the upper extremities. This inference is plausible since the participating children with CP had Manual Ability Classification System (MACS) levels between I and II. In contrast to the theta–alpha results, children with CP did exhibit a sharp increase in beta activity during the same time period, which was not observed in TD children. This suggests that children with CP still have deficits in the computational aspect of somatosensory processing.

Spinal ephrinB–EphB signaling is involved in the modulation of pain processing. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether protein kinase C-γ (PKCγ) acts as a downstream effector in regulating spinal pain processing associated with ephrinB–EphB signaling in mice. The intrathecal injection of ephrinB2-Fc, an EphB receptor activator, caused thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia, as well as increased activation of spinal PKCγ. Knockdown of spinal PKCγ prevented the pain behaviors induced by ephrinB2-Fc. Furthermore, the intrathecal injection of EphB2-Fc, an EphB receptor blocker, suppressed formalin-induced inflammatory, chronic constriction injury (CCI)-induced neuropathic, and tibia bone cavity tumor cell implantation (TCI)-induced bone cancer pain behaviors, in addition to reducing the activation of spinal PKCγ. Finally, the intrathecal injection of MK801, an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker, prevented the pain behaviors and spinal PKCγ activation induced by ephrinB2-Fc. Overall, the results confirm the important role of PKCγ in the regulation of spinal pain processing associated with ephrinB–EphB signaling.

AB  - Abstract
A consequence of normal aging is a greater susceptibility to memory impairments following an immune challenge such as infection, surgery, or traumatic brain injury. The neuroinflammatory response, produced by these challenges results in increased and prolonged production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the otherwise healthy aged brain. Here we discuss the mechanisms by which long-lasting elevations in pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus produce memory impairments. Sensitized microglia are a primary source of this exaggerated neuroinflammatory response and appear to be a hallmark of the normal aging brain. We review the current understanding of the causes and effects of normal aging-induced microglial sensitization, including dysregulations of the neuroendocrine system, potentiation of neuroinflammatory responses following an immune challenge, and the impairment of memories. We end with a discussion of therapeutic approaches to prevent these deleterious effects.

AB  - Abstract
Perceptual judgments about the angular disparity of a character from its standard upright (i.e., mental rotation task) result in a concurrent increase in reaction time (RT) and modulation of the amplitude of the P300 event-related brain potential (ERP). It has therefore been proposed that the P300 represents the neural processes associated with a visual rotation. In turn, the visuomotor mental rotation (VMR) task requires reaching to a location that deviates from a target by a predetermined angle. Although the VMR task exhibits a linear increase in RT with increasing oblique angles of rotation, work has not examined whether the task is supported via a visual rotation analogous to its mental rotation task counterpart. This represents a notable issue because seminal work involving non-human primates has ascribed VMR performance to the motor-related rotation of directionally tuned neurons in the primary motor cortex. Here we examined the concurrent behavioral and ERP characteristics of a standard reaching task and VMR tasks of 35°, 70°, and 105° of rotation. Results showed that the P300 amplitude was larger for the standard compared to each VMR task – an effect independent of the angle of rotation. In turn, the amplitude of the contingent negative variation (CNV) – an ERP related to cognitive and visuomotor integration for movement preparation – was systematically modulated with angle of rotation. Thus, we propose that the CNV represents an ERP correlate related to the cognitive and/or visuomotor transformation demands of increasing the angular separation between a stimulus and a movement goal.

AB  - Abstract
Sensory events in the space around us trigger specific motor patterns directed toward or away from the spatial location of the sensory source. Spatially-defined sensorimotor associations are well-known in the visual domain but less so for the auditory modality. In particular no spatially-directed audio-motor association has been described for the upper limb. We tested the instantaneous directional tuning of the corticospinal system by means of single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the left motor cortex in 16 healthy volunteers while at rest. We recorded the lateral accelerations of the TMS-evoked movement by means of an accelerometer placed on the forearm. Acoustic stimuli (pure tone frequency = 1000 Hz, duration = 50 ms) coming from 25 different directions lying in the axial anterior half-plane at the height of the participant’s ears were played on earphones. The entire set of sound directions covered a span of 160° (±80° where 0° is the frontal direction) at a fixed azimuth angle. Six different intervals between sound onset and TMS (0, 25, 50, 100, 150 and 200 ms) were tested for each sound direction. Significant correlations were found between sound origin and TMS-evoked arm accelerations only when TMS was delivered 50 ms prior to sound onset. We show the presence in the upper limb motor system of auditory spatial tuning. Sound information accesses the motor system at very short latency, potentially compatible with both a subcortical and a cortical origin of the response. The use of TMS-evoked accelerations allowed us to disclose a strict directional tuning in audio-motor associations.

AB  - Abstract
The ability to categorize social information is essential to survive in a primate’s social group. In the monkey brain, there are neural systems to categorize social information. Among these, the relationship between the amygdala and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) has recently gained focus with regard to emotion regulation. However, the processing of facial information and the functional differences in these two areas remain unclear. Thus, in this study, we examined the response properties of single neurons in the amygdala and vlPFC while presenting video clips of three types of facial emotions (aggressive threat, coo, and scream) in Macaca mulatta. Neurons in the amygdala were preferentially activated upon presentation of a scream facial expression, which is strongly negative, whereas the neurons in the vlPFC were activated upon presentation of coo, a facial expression with multiple meanings depending on the social context. Information analyses revealed that the amount of information conveyed by the amygdala neurons about the type of emotion transiently increased immediately after stimulus presentation. In contrast, the information conveyed by the vlPFC neurons showed sustained elevation during stimulus presentation. Therefore, our results suggest that the amygdala processes strong emotion roughly but rapidly, whereas the vlPFC spends a great deal of time processing ambiguous facial information in communication, and make an accurate decision from multiple possibilities based on memory.

AB  - Abstract
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ is a potential pharmacological target for disease-modification in Parkinson’s disease (PD), mainly acting by modulating the neuroinflammatory response. However, currently available agonists thiazolidinediones (TZDs) present limitations due to safety concerns. We evaluated a novel thiobarbituric-like compound MDG548, which acts as a functional PPARγ agonist displaying higher and selective binding affinity as compared to TZDs. Neuroprotection by MDG548 was tested in vitro and in a mouse MPTP model of PD, and neuroinflammation was investigated as a putative underlying mechanism. Viability assay on rat cortical neurons showed lack of cytotoxic effect in the dose-range of 100 nM–10 μM, which was therefore used for testing in vitro protection against H2O2 and MPP+ neurotoxicity. MDG548 dose-dependently increased cell viability of rat cortical neurons co-treated with H2O2 or pre-exposed to MDG548 prior to H2O2. Moreover, MDG548 induced neuroprotection in MPP+-treated PC12 cells. NF-kB activation was investigated to assess anti-inflammatory activity. MDG548 dose-dependently decreased NF-kB activation induced by LPS (100 ng/100 ml) in HEK-Blue-hTLR4 cells. Given the supposed cancer risk of other PPARγ agonists, Ames test for genotoxicity was performed in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA98 strains, showing that MDG548 was not genotoxic. In vivo, BL/6J mice were treated with MPTP (20 mg/kg i.p. once/day for 4 days) in association with saline or MDG548 (2, 5, 10 mg/kg i.p.). Stereological counting showed that MDG548 prevented the MPTP-induced reduction in TH-positive cells in the substantia nigra compacta (SNc) at all doses tested. Moreover, MDG548 reduced reactive microglia and iNOS induction in the SNc. MDG548, being a non-TZD compound with high PPARγ affinity, void of genotoxicity, and with in vitro as well as in vivo neuroprotective properties, provides a promising alternative in the search for safer PPARγ agonists to be tested as potential disease-modifying drugs in PD.

AB  - Abstract
Oxidative stress (OS) mediated the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Astaxanthin (ATX) has been reported to exert antioxidant activities as well as neuroprotective effects in vivo and in vitro. But it is still unknown whether the Akt/glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) signaling mediated the neuroprotective effect of ATX in HT22 cells. Flow cytometric analysis was used to evaluate reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Caspase and PARP activity was measured. The expressions of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), Bcl-2, Bax, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), cytochrome-c (Cyto-c), p-Akt and p-GSK-3β were evaluated to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Our results showed that ATX significantly attenuated glutamate-induced cell viability loss and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, decreased the expression of caspase-3/8/9 activity and cleaved PARP, and suppressed the intracellular accumulation of ROS in HT22 cells after exposure to glutamate. ATX also increased the mitochondrial expression of AIF, Cyto-c as well as Bax while decreased Bcl-2. Moreover, ATX also induced the HO-1 expression in a dose and time-dependent manner, increased the antioxidant-responsive element (ARE) activity and nuclear Nrf2 expression. Furthermore, treatment with ATX restored the p-Akt and p-GSK-3β (Ser9) as well as HO-1 expression reduced by glutamate. This protective effect was partially blocked by the inhibitors lithium chloride treatment in HT22, indicating the involvement of Akt/GSK-3β inactivation during the neuroprotective effect of ATX. Our results provide the first evidence that ATX can protect glutamate-induced cytotoxicity in HT22 via attenuating caspase activation and mitochondrial dysfunction and modulating the Akt/GSK-3β signaling, indicating ATX may be useful for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as AD.

AB  - Abstract
Prairie voles are unusual mammals in that, like humans, they are capable of forming socially monogamous pair bonds, display biparental care, and engage in alloparental behaviors. Both mu and kappa opioid receptors are involved in behaviors that either establish and maintain, or result from pair bond formation in these animals. Mu and kappa opioid receptors both utilize inhibitory G-proteins in signal transduction mechanisms, however the efficacy by which these receptor subtypes stimulate G-protein signaling across the prairie vole neuraxis is not known. Utilizing [35S]GTPγS autoradiography, we characterized the efficacy of G-protein stimulation in coronal sections throughout male and female prairie vole brains by [d-Ala2,NMe-Phe4,Gly-ol5]-enkephalin (DAMGO) and U50,488H, selective mu and kappa opioid agonists, respectively. DAMGO stimulation was highest in the forebrain, similar to that found with other rodent species. U-50,488H produced greater stimulation in prairie voles than is typically seen in mice and rats, particularly in select forebrain areas. DAMGO produced higher stimulation in the core versus the shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in females, while the distribution of U-50,488H stimulation was the opposite. There were no gender differences for U50,488H stimulation of G-protein activity across the regions examined, while DAMGO stimulation was greater in sections from females compared to those from males for NAc core, entopeduncular nucleus, and hippocampus. These data suggest that the kappa opioid system may be more sensitive to manipulation in prairie voles compared to mice and rats, and that female prairie voles may be more sensitive to mu agonists in select brain regions than males.

AB  - Abstract
Epileptogenesis is a dynamic process initiated by insults to the brain that is characterized by progressive functional and structural alterations in certain cerebral regions, leading to the appearance of spontaneous recurrent seizures. Within the duration of the trauma to the brain and the appearance of spontaneous recurrent seizures, there is typically a latent period, which may offer a therapeutic window for preventing the emergence of epilepsy. Previous animal studies have shown that curcumin can attenuate acute seizure severity and brain oxidative stress, but the effect of curcumin on epileptogenesis has not been studied. We examined the effect of continued administration of curcumin during the latent period on epileptogenesis and the deleterious consequences of status epilepticus in adult rats in a post-status epilepticus model of temporal lobe epilepsy induced by kainic acid. We demonstrate that, while administration of curcumin treatment during the latent period does not prevent occurrence of spontaneous recurrent seizures after status epilepticus, it can attenuate the severity of spontaneous recurrent seizures and protect against cognitive impairment. Thus, treatment with curcumin during the latent period following status epilepticus is beneficial in modifying epileptogenesis.

AB  - Abstract
The present research aimed at determining the role played by the amygdala in reward devaluation using transient inactivation induced by lidocaine microinfusions into the centromedial region. Two situations involving reward devaluation were tested in rats: consummatory successive negative contrast (cSNC) and anticipatory negative contrast (ANC). In cSNC, rats exposed to a downshift from 32% to 4% sucrose consume less 4% sucrose than rats always exposed to 4% sucrose. Extensive evidence suggests that reward devaluation in the cSNC situation is accompanied by negative emotion. In ANC, rats consume less 4% sucrose when each session is closely followed by access to 32% sucrose rather than by 4% sucrose. Evidence suggests that reward devaluation in the ANC situation does not involve negative emotions; rather, ANC appears to involve Pavlovian anticipation of the higher value solution. To test the effects of lidocaine microinfusions in a situation known to induce negative emotion, but unrelated to reward devaluation, animals were also exposed to a lighted open field. Centromedial amygdala inactivation reduced the cSNC effect and increased exploratory behavior in the open field, both effects consistent with a reduction in negative emotional state. However, no detectable effects of amygdala inactivation were observed in the ANC situation. These results suggest that, first, the function of the amygdala is not unique to reward devaluation and, second, it is concerned with tagging the devaluation experience with aversive valence.

This study used the framework of the referent configuration hypothesis and slow changes in the external conditions during vertical oscillation of a hand-held object to infer the characteristics of hypothetical control variables. The study had two main objectives: (1) to show that hypothetical control variables, namely, referent coordinates and apparent stiffness of vertical hand position and grip force can be measured in an experiment; and (2) to establish relation(s) between these control variables that yield the classic grip-force–load-force coupling. Healthy subjects gripped a handle and performed vertical oscillations between visual targets at one of five metronome-prescribed frequencies. A HapticMaster robot was used to induce slow changes in the vertical force applied to the handle, while the size of the handle was changed slowly leading to changes in the grip aperture. The subjects were instructed not to react to possible changes in the external forces. A linear, second-order model was used to reconstruct the referent coordinate and apparent stiffness values for each phase of the vertical oscillation cycle using across-cycle regressions. The reconstructed time profiles of the referent coordinates and apparent stiffness showed consistent trends across subjects and movement frequencies. To validate the method, these values were used to predict the vertical force and the grip force applied to the handle for movement cycles that were not utilized in the reconstruction process. Analysis of the coupling between the four variables, two referent coordinates and two apparent stiffness values, revealed a single strong constraint reflecting the coupling between the grip force and vertical force. We view these data as providing experimental support for the idea of controlling natural, multi-muscle actions with shifts in a low-dimensional set of referent coordinates.

AB  - Abstract
Astrocytes are major supportive cells in brains with important functions including providing nutrients and regulating neuronal activities. In this study, we demonstrated that astrocytes regulate amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing in neuronal cells through secretion of group IIA secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-IIA). When astrocytic cells (DITNC) were mildly stimulated with the pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF α and IL-1β, sPLA2-IIA was secreted into the medium. When conditioned medium containing sPLA2-IIA was applied to human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells, there was an increase in both cell membrane fluidity and secretion of α-secretase-cleaved soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPPα). These changes were abrogated by KH064, a selective inhibitor of sPLA2-IIA. In addition, exposing SH-SY5Y cells to recombinant human sPLA2-IIA also increased membrane fluidity, accumulation of APP at the cell surface, and secretion of sAPPα, but without altering total expressions of APP, α-secretases and β-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1). Taken together, our results provide novel information regarding a functional role of sPLA2-IIA in astrocytes for regulating APP processing in neuronal cells.

AB  - Abstract
Aquaporin-4 (AQP4), a water channel protein, is expressed mainly in the perivascular end-feet of astrocytes in the brain and spinal cord. Dysregulation of AQP4 is critically associated with abnormal water transport in the astrocytes. We aimed to examine whether peripheral nerve injury (PNI) could induce the changes of AQP4 expression and astrocytic morphology in the spinal cord. Two different PNI models [partial sciatic nerve transection (PST) and chronic constriction injury (CCI)] were established on the left sciatic nerve in Sprague–Dawley rats, which decreased the pain withdrawal threshold in the ipsilateral hind paws. Both PNI models were associated with a persistent up-regulation of AQP4 in the ipsilateral dorsal horn at the lower lumbar region over 3 weeks, despite an absence of direct injury to the spinal cord. Three-dimensional reconstruction of astrocytes was made and morphometric analysis was done. Up-regulation of AQP4 was accompanied by a significant increase in the length and volume of astrocytic processes and the number of branch points. The most prominent changes were present in the distal processes of the astrocytes and the changes were maintained throughout the whole experimental period. Extravasation of systemically administered tracers Evans Blue and sodium fluorescein was not seen in both models. Taken together, PNI was associated with a long-lasting AQP4 up-regulation and enlargement of astrocytic processes in the spinal cord in rats, both of which were not related to the disruption of blood–spinal cord barrier. The findings could provide novel insights on the understanding of pathophysiology of spinal cords after PNI.

AB  - Abstract
Opioid receptors, especially μ-opioid receptors, in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) are reported to regulate food motivation. However, the roles of μ-, δ- and κ-opioid receptors are not fully understood. Moreover, since μ-, δ- and κ-opioid receptors are reported to distribute in the hypothalamus, these receptors in the hypothalamus might regulate feeding behavior. Thus, the present study investigated the role of μ-, δ- and κ-opioid receptors in the VTA, the NAcc and the hypothalamus in the regulation of feeding behavior. Male ICR mice were subjected to a feeding test after food deprivation for 16 h. The mRNA levels of proopiomelanocortin (POMC), preproenkephalin (PENK) and prodynorphin (PDYN), the precursors of endogenous opioid peptides, were measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The systemic injection of non-selective (naloxone) and selective μ (β-funaltrexamine; β-FNA), δ (naltrindole) and κ (norbinaltorphimine; norBNI) opioid receptor antagonists markedly reduced food intake. In contrast, the systemic injection of preferential μ (morphine), selective δ (KNT-127) and κ (U-50,488) opioid receptor agonists did not change food intake. The mRNA levels of POMC, PENK and PDYN were decreased in the hypothalamus and the midbrain after food deprivation, whereas the mRNA levels of PENK and PDYN, but not POMC, were decreased in the ventral striatum. The injection of naloxone into the NAcc, VTA and lateral hypothalamus (LH), but not the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, significantly decreased food intake. The injection of β-FNA and naltrindole into the LH, but not the VTA or NAcc, decreased food intake. The injection of norBNI into the LH and VTA, but not the NAcc, decreased food intake. These results indicate that μ-, δ- and κ-opioid receptors in the LH play a more important role in the regulation of feeding behavior than those receptors in the VTA and the NAcc.

AB  - Abstract
A common scientific strategy toward understanding consciousness is to study neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) for a particular conscious percept. This can be done by contrasting conditions in which subjects are aware and unaware of a particular visual stimulus. However, recent findings have been contradictory and this approach appears not to reveal only the NCC, but also the prerequisites or consequences of consciousness. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether the P300 component often claimed to be a key signature of conscious access might actually rather reflect the consequences of conscious perception. Subjects participated in an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment where most of the stimuli were clearly perceived and only a quarter of trials was associated with not perceiving the target. The visual masking paradigm used no discrimination task, always the same stimulus was presented and an additional task was given together with the target stimulus. Results indicate that trials where subjects reported to have seen the stimulus are associated with a more pronounced P300. Hence, the present data support the theories which claim that P300 is a marker of conscious perception. However, an earlier component, visual awareness negativity also tracks conscious perception reliably so that the P300 need not be the earliest correlate of conscious perception.

AB  - Abstract
Angiotensin II (ANG II) is known to promote leptin production and secretion. Although ANG II type 1 receptors (AT1Rs) and leptin are expressed within the carotid body, it is not known whether AT1R and leptin are co-expressed in the same glomus cells nor if these peptides are affected within the carotid body by intermittent hypoxia (IH). This study was done to investigate whether ANG II modulated leptin signaling in the carotid body during IH. Rats were treated with captopril (Capt) or the AT1R blocker losartan (Los) in the drinking water for 3 days prior to being exposed to IH (8h) or normoxia (8h). IH induced increases in plasma ANG II and leptin compared to normoxic controls. Capt treatment abolished the plasma leptin changes to IH, whereas Los treatment had no effect on the IH induced increase in plasma leptin. Additionally, carotid body glomus cells containing both leptin and the long form of the leptin receptor (OB-Rb) were found to co-express AT1R protein, and IH increased the expression of only AT1R protein within the carotid body in both Capt- and non-Capt-treated animals. On the other hand, Los treatment did not modify AT1R protein expression to IH. Additionally, Capt and Los treatment eliminated the elevated carotid body leptin protein expression, and the changes in phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription three protein, the short form of the leptin receptor (OB-R100), suppressor of cytokine signaling 3, and phosphorylated extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 protein expression induced by IH. However, Capt elevated the expression of OB-Rb protein, whereas Los abolished the changes in OB-Rb protein to IH. These findings, taken together with the previous observation that ANG II modifies carotid body chemosensitivity, suggest that the increased circulating levels of ANG II and leptin induced by IH act at the carotid body to alter leptin signaling within the carotid body which in turn may influence chemoreceptor function.

AB  - Abstract
Understanding mechanisms for vessel tone regulation within the trigeminal nuclei is of great interest because some headache syndromes are due to dysregulation of such mechanisms. Previous experiments on animal models suggest that mastication may alter neuron metabolism and blood supply in these nuclei. To investigate this hypothesis in humans, arterial spin-labeling magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to measure blood perfusion within the principal trigeminal nucleus (Vp) and in the dorsolateral-midbrain (DM, including the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus) in healthy volunteers, before and immediately after a mastication exercise consisting of chewing a gum on one side of the mouth for 1 h at 1 bite/s. The side preference for masticating was evaluated with a chewing test and the volume of the masseter muscle was measured on T1-weighted MRI scans.

The results demonstrated that the mastication exercise caused a perfusion increase within the Vp, but not in the DM. This change was correlated to the preference score for the side where the exercise took place. Moreover, the basal Vp perfusion was correlated to the masseter volume.

These results indicate that the local vascular tone of the trigeminal nuclei can be constitutively altered by the chewing practice and by strong or sustained chewing.

AB  - Abstract
Exposure to early-life inflammation results in time-of-challenge-dependent changes in both brain and behavior. The consequences of this neural and behavioral reprogramming are most often reported in adulthood. However, the trajectory for the expression of these various changes is not well delineated, particularly between the juvenile and adult phases of development. Moreover, interventions to protect against these neurodevelopmental disruptions are rarely evaluated. Here, female Sprague–Dawley rats were housed in either environmental enrichment (EE) or standard care (SC) and their male and female offspring were administered 50 μg/kg i.p. of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or pyrogen-free saline in a dual-administration neonatal protocol. All animals maintained their respective housing assignments from breeding until the end of the study. LPS exposure on postnatal days (P) 3 and 5 of life resulted in differential expression of emotional and cognitive disruptions and evidence of oxidative stress across development. Specifically, social behavior was reduced in neonatal-treated (n)LPS animals at adolescence (P40), but not adulthood (P70). In contrast, male nLPS rats exhibited intact spatial memory as adolescents which was impaired in later life. Moreover, these males had decreased prefrontal cortex levels of glutathione at P40, which was normalized in adult animals. Notably, EE appeared to offer some protection against the consequences of inflammation on juvenile social behavior and fully prevented reduced glutathione levels in the juvenile prefrontal cortex. Combined, these time-dependent effects provide evidence that early-life inflammation interacts with other developmental variables, specifically puberty and EE, in the expression (and prevention) of select behavioral and molecular programs.

AB  - Abstract
Paraquat (PQ) and maneb (MB) are potential risk factors for Parkinson’s disease. However, their impact on non-motor disorders, monoamine neurotransmission and basal ganglia function is not clearly determined. Here we investigated the effects of combined treatment with PQ/MB on motor behavior, anxiety and “depressive-like” disorders, tissue content of monoamines, and subthalamic nucleus (STN) neuronal activity. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were intoxicated by PQ (10 mg/kg) and MB (30 mg/kg) twice a week. Two weeks later, the majority of animals (group 1, 16/26) showed a severe loss of body weight with tremor and respiratory distress and others (group 2, 6/26) showed only tremor. Animals of group 2 received PQ/MB during four weeks before developing weight loss. A last group (group 3, 4/26) was insensitive to PQ/MB after 6 weeks of injections. Groups 1 and 2 displayed a failure of motor activity and motor coordination. Group 3 showed slight motor deficits only after the last injection of PQ/MB. Moreover, PQ/MB induced anxiety and “depressive-like” behaviors in animals of groups 2 and 3. Biochemical analysis showed that PQ/MB reduced striatal dopamine (DA) tissue content paralleled by changes in the activity of STN neurons without changing the content of norepinephrine and serotonin in the cortex. Our data provide evidence that individuals are not equally sensitive to PQ/MB and show that the motor deficits in vulnerable animals, are not only a result of DA neuron degeneration, but may also be a consequence of peripheral disabilities. Nevertheless, the parkinsonian-like non-motor impairments may be a direct consequence of the bilateral DA depletion.

AB  - Abstract
Proliferation and differentiation of retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) are tightly controlled by extrinsic cues and distinct combinations of transcription factors leading to the generation of retinal cell type diversity. In this context, we investigated the role of the protein tyrosine phosphatase interacting protein 51 (PTPIP51) in the differentiation of RPCs. The expression pattern of PTPIP51 was analyzed by immunostaining during post-natal retinal development in the rat. Ex vivo electroporation has been used to silence or misexpress PTPIP51 in post-natal retinal explants, and the retinal phenotype was investigated after 3–7 days in vitro (div). PTPIP51 expression in the retina started postnatally and was maintained throughout adulthood, especially in retinal ganglion cells and in the inner segment of photoreceptor cells. Silencing of Ptpip51 expression in postnatal retina failed to modify the commitment of late RPCs in the different lineages but severely impaired the final differentiation of photoreceptors, observed by a decrease in the fraction of Rhodopsin-positive cells after 7 div. By contrast, misexpression of PTPIP51 in early or late RPCs failed to modify the differentiation of the RPCs. Our data demonstrate that PTPIP51 is implicated in the differentiation process of immature photoreceptors. Because PTPIP51 is specifically localized in the inner segment, PTPIP51 may contribute to the complex stage of maturation of the apical segment of these cells.

AB  - Abstract
Homeostasis of magnesium ion (Mg2+) plays key roles in healthy neuronal functions, and deficiency of Mg2+ is involved in various neuronal diseases. In neurons, we have reported that excitotoxicity induced by excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate increases intracellular Mg2+ concentration ([Mg2+]i). However, it has not been revealed whether neuronal activity under physiological condition modulates [Mg2+]i. The aim of this study is to explore the direct relationship between neural activity and [Mg2+]i dynamics. In rat primary-dissociated hippocampal neurons, the [Mg2+]i and [Ca2+]i dynamics were simultaneously visualized with a highly selective fluorescent Mg2+ probe, KMG-104, and a fluorescent Ca2+ probe, Fura Red, respectively. [Mg2+]i increase concomitant with neural activity by direct current stimulation was observed in neurons plated on an indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass electrode, which enables fluorescent imaging during neural stimulation. The neural activity-dependent [Mg2+]i increase was also detected in neurons whose excitability was enhanced by the treatment of a voltage-gated K+ channel blocker, tetraethylammonium (TEA) at the timings of spontaneous Ca2+ increase. Furthermore, the [Mg2+]i increase was abolished in Mg2+-free extracellular medium, indicating [Mg2+]i increase is due to Mg2+ influx induced by neural activity. The direct neuronal depolarization by veratridine, a Na+ channel opener, induced [Mg2+]i increase, and this [Mg2+]i increase was suppressed by the pretreatment of a non-specific Mg2+ channel inhibitor, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB). Overall, activity-dependent [Mg2+]i increase results from Mg2+ influx through 2-APB-sensitive channels in rat hippocampal neurons.

AB  - Abstract
The experience of pain is a highly complex and personal experience, characterized by tremendous inter-individual variability. The purpose of this study was to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize responses in the brainstem and spinal cord to the same heat stimulus in healthy participants, to further our understanding of individual differences in pain perception. Responses to noxious heat stimuli at 49 °C were investigated in 20 healthy individuals by means of fMRI of the brainstem and spinal cord, at 3 Tesla, and were compared with brain fMRI and quantitative sensory testing. Blood oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) responses were detected with a general linear model (GLM) and effective connectivity was examined with structural equation modeling (SEM). Reported pain ratings ranged from 18 to 84/100 across the participants. Consistent with previous research, brain fMRI results show that BOLD responses in a number of cortical regions are correlated with individual pain ratings. Correlations between pain scores and BOLD responses are also demonstrated in the spinal cord dorsal horn, locus coeruleus, and thalamus. SEM results demonstrate the network of brainstem and spinal cord regions that contribute to the pain response, and reveal differences related to individual pain sensitivity. The results of this study are consistent with the conclusion that individual differences in pain perception in healthy participants are a consequence of differences in descending modulation of spinal nociceptive processes from brainstem regions.

AB  - Abstract
Rationale: Acute administration of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) non-competitive antagonist, MK-801, impairs novel object recognition (NOR), locomotor activity in open field (OF) and conditioned taste aversion (CTA) in rodents. NMDAR partial agonist d-cycloserine (DCS) reverses these effects in NOR and CTA via modulation of glutamatergic, cholinergic and dopaminergic systems. Objectives and methods: To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of DCS, a partial NMDAR agonist, on NOR memory, locomotor activity, and CTA memory in Wistar rats on NMDA-glutamate receptor antagonism by MK-801. The potential involvement of dopaminergic and cholinergic systems in improving cognitive functions was explored. MK-801-induced cognitive deficits were assessed using NOR, OF and CTA paradigms. MK-801-induced dopamine release increase in acetylcholinesterase (AChE), mono amine oxidase (MAO) activity and increase in c-fos expression were also investigated. Results: The effects caused by MK-801 (0.2 mg/kg) were inhibited by administration of the NMDA receptor agonist DCS (15 mg/kg). NOR and CTA paradigms inhibited by MK-801 were attenuated by DCS administration. Moreover, DCS also blocked the MK-801-induced abnormal increase in dopamine content, AChE activity and MAO activity. However, c-fos overexpression was controlled to some extent only. Conclusions: Based on the NMDAR hypo function hypothesis in some neuropsychiatric disorders, our finding suggests that improving NMDAR hypo function by agonist DCS may play a significant role.

AB  - Abstract
Electrical synapses formed by gap junctions composed of connexin36 (Cx36) are widely distributed in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS). Here, we used immunofluorescence methods to document the expression of Cx36 in the cochlear nucleus and in various structures of the auditory pathway of rat and mouse. Labeling of Cx36 visualized exclusively as Cx36-puncta was densely distributed primarily on the somata and initial dendrites of neuronal populations in the ventral cochlear nucleus, and was abundant in superficial layers of the dorsal cochlear nucleus. Other auditory centers displaying Cx36-puncta included the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), regions surrounding the lateral superior olivary nucleus, the dorsal nucleus of the medial lemniscus, the nucleus sagulum, all subnuclei of the inferior colliculus, and the auditory cerebral cortex. In EGFP-Cx36 transgenic mice, EGFP reporter was detected in neurons located in each of auditory centers that harbored Cx36-puncta. In the ventral cochlear nuclei and the MNTB, many neuronal somata were heavily innervated by nerve terminals containing vesicular glutamate transporter-1 (vglut1) and Cx36 was frequently localized at these terminals. Cochlear ablation caused a near total depletion of vglut1-positive terminals in the ventral cochlear nuclei, with a commensurate loss of labeling for Cx36 around most neuronal somata, but preserved Cx36-puncta at somatic neuronal appositions. The results suggest that electrical synapses formed by Cx36-containing gap junctions occur in most of the widely distributed centers of the auditory system. Further, it appears that morphologically mixed chemical/electrical synapses formed by nerve terminals are abundant in the ventral cochlear nucleus, including those at endbulbs of Held formed by cochlear primary afferent fibers, and those at calyx of Held synapses on MNTB neurons.

The hippocampus is strongly implicated in the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. Functionally, basal hippocampal activity (perfusion) is elevated in schizophrenic psychosis, as measured with positron emission tomography (PET) and with magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion techniques, while hippocampal activation to memory tasks is reduced. Subfield-specific hippocampal molecular pathology exists in human psychosis tissue which could underlie this neuronal hyperactivity, including increased GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors in hippocampal CA3, along with increased postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) along with augmented dendritic spines on the pyramidal neuron apical dendrites. We interpret these observations to implicate a reduction in the influence of a ubiquitous gene repressor, repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor (REST) in psychosis; REST is involved in the age-related maturation of the NMDA receptor from GluN2B- to GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors through epigenetic remodeling. These CA3 changes in psychosis leave the hippocampus liable to pathological increases in neuronal activity, feedforward excitation and false memory formation, sometimes with psychotic content.

AB  - Abstract
Sleep is strongly implicated in learning, especially in the reprocessing of recently acquired memory. Children with intellectual disability (ID) tend to have sleep-wake disturbances, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease. Given that sleep is partly controlled by the circadian clock, we decided to study the rhythmic expression of genes in the hippocampus, a brain structure which plays a key role in memory in humans and rodents.

By investigating the hippocampal transcriptome of adult mice, we identified 663 circadian clock controlled (CCC) genes, which we divided into four categories based on their temporal pattern of expression. In addition to the standard core clock genes, enrichment analysis identified several transcription factors among these hippocampal CCC genes, and our findings suggest that genes from one cluster regulate the expression of those in another. Interestingly, these hippocampal CCC genes were highly enriched in sleep/wakefulness-related genes. We show here that several genes in the glucocorticoid signaling pathway, which is involved in memory, show a CCC pattern of expression. However, ID genes were not enriched among these CCC genes, suggesting that sleep or learning and memory disturbances observed in patients with ID are probably not related to the circadian clock in the hippocampus.

AB  - Abstract
Rapastinel (GLYX-13) is an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) modulator that has characteristics of a glycine site partial agonist. Rapastinel is a robust cognitive enhancer and facilitates hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission in slices. In human clinical trials, rapastinel has been shown to produce marked antidepressant properties that last for at least one week following a single dose. The long-lasting antidepressant effect of a single dose of rapastinel (3 mg/kg IV) was assessed in rats using the Porsolt, open field and ultrasonic vocalization assays. Cognitive enhancement was examined using the Morris water maze, positive emotional learning, and contextual fear extinction tests. LTP was assessed in hippocampal slices. Dendritic spine morphology was measured in the dentate gyrus and the medial prefrontal cortex. Significant antidepressant-like or cognitive enhancing effects were observed that lasted for at least one week in each model. Rapastinel facilitated LTP 1 day–2 weeks but not 4 weeks post-dosing. Biweekly dosing with rapastinel sustained this effect for at least 8 weeks. A single dose of rapastinel increased the proportion of whole-cell NMDAR current contributed by NR2B-containing NMDARs in the hippocampus 1 week post-dosing, that returned to baseline by 4 weeks post-dosing. The NMDAR antagonist 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) blocked the antidepressant-like effect of rapastinel 1 week post dosing. A single injection of rapastinel also increased mature spine density in both brain regions 24 h post-dosing. These data demonstrate that rapastinel produces its long-lasting antidepressant effects via triggering NMDAR-dependent processes that lead to increased sensitivity to LTP that persist for up to two weeks. These data also suggest that these processes led to the alterations in dendritic spine morphologies associated with the maintenance of long-term changes in synaptic plasticity associated with learning and memory.

AB  - Abstract
The aim of the present work is to analyze how prenatal binge-like ethanol exposure to a moderate dose (2.0 g/kg; group Pre-EtOH) during gestational days (GD) 17–20 affects hydroelectrolyte regulatory responses. This type of exposure has been observed to increase ethanol consumption during adolescence (postnatal day 30–32). In this study we analyzed basal brain neural activity and basal-induced sodium appetite (SA) and renal response stimulated by sodium depletion (SD) as well as voluntary ethanol consumption as a function of vehicle or ethanol during late pregnancy. In adolescent offspring, SD was induced by furosemide and a low-sodium diet treatment (FURO + LSD). Other animals were analyzed in terms of immunohistochemical detection of Fra-like (Fra-LI-ir) protein and serotonin (5HT) and/or vasopressin (AVP). The Pre-EtOH group exhibited heightened voluntary ethanol intake and a reduction in sodium and water intake induced by SD relative to controls. Basal Na and K concentrations in urine were also reduced in Pre-EtOH animals while the induced renal response after FURO treatment was similar across prenatal treatments. However, the correlation between urine volume and water intake induced by FURO significantly varied across these treatments. At the brain level of analysis, the number of basal Fra-LI-ir was significantly increased in AVP magnocellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and in 5HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) in Pre-EtOH pups. In the experimental group, we also observed a significant increase in Fra-LI along the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and in the central extended amygdala nuclei. In summary, moderate Pre-EtOH exposure produces long-lasting changes in brain organization, affecting basal activity of central extended amygdala nuclei, AVP neurons and the inhibitory areas of SA such as the NTS and the 5HT-DRN. These changes possibly modulate the above described variations in basal-induced drinking behaviors and renal regulatory responses.

AB  - Abstract
Positive allosteric modulators of GABAB receptors have great therapeutic potential for medications of anxiety, depression, etc. The effects of recently discovered modulator rac-BHFF on the key characteristics of GABAergic neurotransmission were investigated in cortical and hippocampal presynaptic nerve terminals of rats (synaptosomes). The ambient level of [3H]GABA that is a balance between release and uptake of the neurotransmitter increased significantly in the presence of rac-BHFF (at concentrations 10–30 μM). The initial velocity of synaptosomal [3H]GABA uptake was suppressed by the modulator. In the presence of GABA transporter blocker NO-711, it was shown that rac-BHFF increased tonic release of [3H]GABA from synaptosomes (at concentrations 3–30 μM). Rac-BHFF within the concentration range of 0.3–30 μM did not enhance inhibiting effect of (±)-baclofen on depolarization-induced exocytotic release of [3H]GABA. Rac-BHFF (0.3–30 μM) caused dose-dependent depolarization of the plasma membrane and dissipation of the proton gradient of synaptic vesicles in synaptosomes that was shown in the absence/presence of GABAB receptor antagonist saclofen using fluorescent dyes rhodamine 6G and acridine orange, respectively, and so, the above effects of rac-BHFF were not associated with the modulation of presynaptic GABAB receptors. Therefore, drug development strategy of positive allosteric modulation of GABAB receptors is to eliminate the above side effects of rac-BHFF in presynapse, and vice versa, these new properties of rac-BHFF may be exploited appropriately.

AB  - Abstract
Sulfuretin, one of the major flavonoid glycosides found in the stem bark of Albizzia julibrissin and heartwood of Rhus verniciflua, is a known anti-oxidant. We previously demonstrated that sulfuretin inhibits neuronal death via reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent mechanisms in human SH-SY5Y cells, although other relevant mechanisms of action of this compound remain largely uncharacterized. As part of our ongoing exploration of the pharmacological actions of sulfuretin, we studied the neuroprotective effects of sulfuretin against amyloid beta (Aβ)-induced neurotoxicity in human SH-SY5Y and primary hippocampal neuron cells and investigated the possible mechanisms involved. Specifically, we found in the present study that sulfuretin significantly attenuates the decrease in cell viability, release of lactate dehydrogenase, and accumulation of ROS associated with Aβ25–35-induced neurotoxicity in neuronal cells. Furthermore, sulfuretin stimulated the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a downstream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K)/Akt. We demonstrated that sulfuretin induces the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an anti-oxidant response gene. Notably, we found that the neuroprotective effects of sulfuretin were diminished by an Nrf2 small interfering RNA (siRNA), the HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP), as well as the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002. Taken together, these results indicated that sulfuretin protects neuronal cells from Aβ25–35-induced neurotoxicity through activation of Nrf/HO-1 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Our results also indicate that sulfuretin-induced induction of Nrf2-dependent HO-1 expression via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway has preventive and/or therapeutic potential for the management of Alzheimer’s disease.

AB  - Abstract
The hippocampal CA1 region receives cortical information via two main inputs: directly via the perforant (temporoammonic) path (pp-CA1 synapse) and indirectly via the tri-synaptic pathway. Although synaptic plasticity has been reported at the pp-CA1 synapse of freely behaving animals, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon have not been investigated. Here, we explored whether long-term potentiation (LTP) at the pp-CA1 synapse in freely behaving rats requires activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). As group II metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors are densely localized on presynaptic terminals of the perforant path, and are important for certain forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, we also explored whether group II mGlu receptors affect LTP at the pp-CA1 synapse and/or regulate basal synaptic transmission at this synapse in vivo.

In adult male rats, high-frequency stimulation (200 Hz) given as 3, or 10 trains, resulted in robust LTP that lasted for at least 4 h in pp-CA1 or pp-dentate gyrus (DG) synapses, respectively. Pre-treatment with the NMDAR antagonist D-(−)-2-amino-5-phosphopentanoic acid (D-AP5) partially inhibited LTP at pp-CA1, and completely prevented LTP at pp-DG synapses. Combined antagonism of NMDAR using D-AP5 and the VGCC inhibitor, (−)-methoxyverapamil hydrochloride elicited a further inhibition of the LTP response at pp-CA1 synapses. Whereas activation of group II mGlu receptors using (1R,2R)-3-((1S)-1-amino-2-hydroxy-2-oxoethyl) cyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid (DCG-IV) dose-dependently reduced basal synaptic transmission elicited by test-pulse stimulation, DCG-IV did not affect LTP in a dose that inhibited LTP at pp-DG synapses in vivo. These data indicate that LTP at the pp-CA1 synapse of freely behaving animals is dually dependent on NMDAR and VGCCs, whereby group II mGlu receptor activation affect basal synaptic tonus, but not LTP. The lower frequency-dependency of NMDA-VGCC LTP at pp-CA1 synapses compared to pp-DG synapses may comprise a mechanism to prioritize information processing at this synapse.

AB  - Abstract
Phytanic acid (Phyt) accumulates in various peroxisomal diseases including Refsum disease (RD) and Zellweger syndrome (ZS). Since the pathogenesis of the neurological symptoms and especially the cerebellar abnormalities in these disorders are poorly known, we investigated the effects of in vivo intracerebral administration of Phyt on a large spectrum of redox homeostasis parameters in the cerebellum of young rats. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, sulfhydryl oxidation, carbonyl content, nitrite and nitrate concentrations, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) oxidation, total (tGS) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and the activities of important antioxidant enzymes were determined at different periods after Phyt administration. Immunohistochemical analysis was also carried out in the cerebellum. Phyt significantly increased MDA and nitric oxide (NO) production and decreased GSH levels, without altering tGS, DCFH oxidation, sulfhydryl oxidation, carbonyl content and the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Phyt caused astrogliosis and protein nitrosative damage in the cerebellum. It was also observed that the NO synthase inhibitor Nω-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) prevented the increase of MDA and NO production as well as the decrease of GSH and the immunohistochemical alterations caused by Phyt, strongly suggesting that reactive nitrogen species (RNS) were involved in these effects. The present data provide in vivo solid evidence that Phyt disrupts redox homeostasis and causes astrogliosis in rat cerebellum probably mediated by RNS production. It is therefore presumed that disequilibrium of redox status may contribute at least in part to the cerebellum alterations characteristic of patients affected by RD and other disorders with Phyt accumulation.

AB  - Abstract
Prolonged neuronal depression after spreading depression (SD) is followed by a late cellular and synaptic hyperexcitability. Intra- and extracellular recordings of bioelectrical activities were performed in the rodent hippocampus to investigate the role of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition in the late hyperexcitable state of SD. The effect of KCl-induced negative DC potential shifts was investigated on extracellularly recorded paired-pulse depression (PPD) and bicuculline-induced afterdischarges as well as intracellularly recorded inhibitory post synaptic potentials (IPSPs) in the hippocampal CA1 area. The results revealed that SD decreased the degree of PPD, enhanced the number and duration of bicuculline-induced afterdischarges, and reduced the amplitude and duration of IPSPs. Application of low concentrations of bicuculline before the induction of SD enhanced the inhibitory effect of SD on IPSPs. Data indicate the contribution of GABA-mediated inhibition to SD-induced delayed hyperexcitability. Modulation of GABA function in the late hyperexcitability phase of SD may play a role in therapeutic management of SD-related neurological disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a widespread gasotransmitter also known as a powerful neuroprotective agent in the central nervous system. However, the action of H2S in peripheral synapses is much less studied. In the current project we studied the modulatory effects of the H2S donor sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) on synaptic transmission in the mouse neuromuscular junction using microelectrode technique. Using focal recordings of presynaptic response and evoked transmitter release we have shown that NaHS (300 μM) increased evoked end-plate currents (EPCs) without changes of presynaptic waveforms which indicated the absence of NaHS effects on sodium and potassium currents of motor nerve endings. Using intracellular recordings it was shown that NaHS increased the frequency of miniature end-plate potentials (MEPPs) without changing their amplitudes indicating a pure presynaptic effect. Furthermore, NaHS increased the amplitude of end-plate potentials (EPPs) without influencing the resting membrane potential of muscle fibers. l-cysteine, a substrate of H2S synthesis induced, similar to NaHS, an increase of EPC amplitudes whereas inhibitors of H2S synthesis (β-cyano-l-alanine and aminooxyacetic acid) had the opposite effect. Inhibition of adenylate cyclase using MDL 12,330A hydrochloride (MDL 12,330A) or elevation of cAMP level with 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (pCPT-cAMP) completely prevented the facilitatory action of NaHS indicating involvement of the cAMP signaling cascade. The facilitatory effect of NaHS was significantly diminished when intracellular calcium (Ca2+) was buffered by 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM) and ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (EGTA-AM). Activation of ryanodine receptors by caffeine or ryanodine increased acetylcholine release and prevented further action of NaHS on transmitter release, likely due to an occlusion effect. Inhibition of ryanodine receptors by ryanodine or dantrolene also reduced the action of NaHS on EPC amplitudes. Our results indicate that in mammalian neuromuscular synapses endogenously produced H2S increases spontaneously and evoked quantal transmitter release from motor nerve endings without changing the response of nerve endings. The presynaptic effect of H2S appears mediated by intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP signaling and involves presynaptic ryanodine receptors.

AB  - Abstract
Non-physical balance training has demonstrated to be efficient to improve postural control in young people. However, little is known about the potential to increase corticospinal excitability by mental simulation in lower leg muscles. Mental simulation of isolated, voluntary contractions of limb muscles increase corticospinal excitability but more automated tasks like walking seem to have no or only minor effects on motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). This may be related to the way of performing the mental simulation or the task itself. Therefore, the present study aimed to clarify how corticospinal excitability is modulated during AO + MI, MI and action observation (AO) of balance tasks. For this purpose, MEPs and H-reflexes were elicited during three different mental simulations (a) AO + MI, (b) MI and (c) passive AO. For each condition, two balance tasks were evaluated: (1) quiet upright stance (static) and (2) compensating a medio-lateral perturbation while standing on a free-swinging platform (dynamic).

AO + MI resulted in the largest facilitation of MEPs followed by MI and passive AO. MEP facilitation was significantly larger in the dynamic perturbation than in the static standing task. Interestingly, passive observation resulted in hardly any facilitation independent of the task. H-reflex amplitudes were not modulated.

The current results demonstrate that corticospinal excitability during mental simulation of balance tasks is influenced by both the type of mental simulation and the task difficulty. As H-reflexes and background EMG were not modulated, it may be argued that changes in excitability of the primary motor cortex were responsible for the MEP modulation. From a functional point of view, our findings suggest best training/rehabilitation effects when combining MI with AO during challenging postural tasks.

Macrophages in the injured spinal cord arise from resident microglia and from infiltrating peripheral myeloid cells. Microglia respond within minutes after central nervous system (CNS) injury and along with other CNS cells signal the influx of their peripheral counterpart. Although some of the functions they carry out are similar, they appear to be specialized to perform particular roles after CNS injury. Microglia and macrophages are very plastic cells that can change their phenotype drastically in response to in vitro and in vivo conditions. They can change from pro-inflammatory, cytotoxic cells to anti-inflammatory, pro-repair phenotypes. The microenvironment of the injured CNS importantly influences macrophage plasticity. This review discusses the phagocytosis and cytokine-mediated effects on macrophage plasticity in the context of spinal cord injury.

AB  - Abstract
Environmental enrichment (EE), which mimics the wealth of sensory, motor and cognitive stimuli that arise through intense interactions with the ambient environment, results in enhanced hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial learning. A key molecular factor in the mediation of these changes is the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). One of the downstream cascades that is activated by BDNF is the cascade linked to the small GTPase, Ras, that triggers mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity and is part of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) pathway that can lead to synaptic restructuring to support LTP. Here, we explored whether persistent activation of Ras in neurons further enhances LTP following EE of rodents. Immediately following weaning, transgenic mice that expressed constitutively activated neuronal Ras, or their wildtype (Wt) littermates, underwent 3 weeks of constant EE. In the absence of EE, theta burst stimulation (TBS) evoked LTP in the CA1 region of transgenic mice that was not significantly different from LTP in Wts. After 3 weeks of EE, hippocampal LTP was improved in Wt mice. Enriched transgenic mice showed an equivalent level of LTP to enriched Wts, but it was not significantly different from non-enriched synRas controls. Western blot analysis performed after a pull-down assay showed that non-enriched transgenic mice expressed higher Ras activity compared to non-enriched Wts. Following EE, Ras activity was reduced in transgenics to levels detected in Wts. These results show that constitutive activation of Ras does not mimic the effects of EE on LTP. In addition, EE results in an equivalent enhancement of LTP transgenics and Wts, coupled with a decrease in Ras activity to Wt levels. This suggests that permanent activation of Ras in neurons of synRas animals following EE results in an altered feedback regulation of endogenous Ras activity that is not a key factor in LTP enhancements. The maintenance of Ras within a physiological range may thus be required for the optimization of LTP in the hippocampus.

AB  - Abstract
Glutamatergic synaptic activity entails a high energetic cost. During aging, a variety of neural metabolic changes have been reported that could compromise the capacity of neural circuits to maintain synaptic transmission during periods of reduced extracellular glucose. Indeed, a preferential compromise in evoked synaptic activity has been observed in hippocampal CA1 with age during exposure to low-glucose solutions. Whether this aging-related compromise in synaptic activity is regionally specific is unclear, however. Data suggest that the dentate gyrus (DG) preferentially exhibits hypometabolism with age and this region plays a critical role in spatial pattern separation, which is compromised with age. Therefore, we assessed whether synaptic activity is also preferentially affected in the DG with age. In vitro extracellular field potential recordings were used to monitor orthodromic and antidromic evoked activity in the DG granule cell layer in hippocampal slices from adult (8–12 months) and aged (22–27 months) rats in aCSF containing 10 mM glucose, followed by a reduced glucose aCSF containing 1 mM glucose. In 10 mM glucose-aCSF, orthodromic- and antidromic-evoked field potential activity was comparable between age groups. However, orthodromic-evoked population spike amplitude and field excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) slope were preferentially decreased in slices from aged rats during exposure to 1 mM glucose-aCSF. Antidromic population spike amplitude was not differentially affected in slices from aged versus adult rats, however. These data suggest that synaptic efficacy is preferentially compromised with age under reduced glucose availability and, combined with a decreased capacity of the periphery to provide glucose to the central nervous system (CNS) during metabolically challenging conditions, could contribute to aging-related hippocampal dysfunction and cognitive decline.

AB  - Abstract
Transient global ischemia selectively damages neurons in specific brain areas. A reproducible pattern of selective vulnerability is observed in the dorsal hippocampus of rodents where ischemic damage typically affects neurons in the CA1 area while sparing neurons in CA3 and granule cells. The “neuronal factors” underlying the differential vulnerability of CA1 versus CA3 have been of great interest. This review first provides on overview of the histological pattern of ischemic–hypoxic damage, the phenomenon of delayed neuronal death, the necrosis–apoptosis discussion, and multiple molecular mechanisms studied in the hippocampus. Subsequently, genomic studies of basal gene expression in CA1 and CA3 are summarized and changes in gene expression in response to global brain ischemia are surveyed. A formal analysis is presented for the overlap between genes expressed under basal conditions in the hippocampus and genes responding to ischemia–hypoxia in general. A possible role of the elusive vascular factors in selective vulnerability is reviewed, and a gene set for angiogenesis is then shown to be enriched in the CA3 gene set. A survey of selective vulnerability in the human hippocampus in relation to genomic studies in ischemia–hypoxia is presented, and neurodegeneration genes with high expression in CA1 are highlighted (e.g. WFS1). It is concluded that neuronal factors dominate the selective vulnerability of CA1 but that vascular factors also deserve more systematic studies.

AB  - Abstract
Contrast adaptation, generated by prolonged viewing of a high contrast spatial pattern, is known to reduce perceptual sensitivity to subsequently presented stimuli of similar spatial frequency (SF). Neural correlates of this pattern-specific contrast adaptation have been described in several classic studies in cat primary visual cortex (V1). These results have also recently been extended to mice, which is a genetically manipulable animal model. Here we attempt to parse the potential mechanisms contributing to this phenomenon by determining whether the SF specificity of contrast adaptation observed in mouse V1 neurons depends on the spike rate elicited by the adapting gratings. We found that adapting stimuli that drove a neuron more strongly generally produced more adaptation, implicating an intrinsic or fatigue-like process. Importantly, we also observed that slightly stronger contrast adaptation was produced when the adapting SF matched the test SF even when matched and nonmatched adapting gratings elicited similar spike rates indicating extrinsic or network processes contribute as well.

AB  - Abstract
The hypocretin/orexin system regulates, among other things, sleep and energy homeostasis. The system is likely regulated by both homeostatic and circadian mechanisms. Little is known about local differences in the regulation of hypocretin activity. The aim of this study was to establish an optimized peptide quantification method for hypocretin-1 extracted from different mouse brain areas and use this method for investigating circadian fluctuations of hypocretin-1 levels in these areas. The results show that hypocretin-1 peptide can be extracted from small pieces of intact tissue, with sufficient yield for measurements in a standard radioimmunoassay. Utilizing the optimized method, it was found that prepro-hypocretin mRNA and peptide show circadian fluctuations in the mouse brain. This study further demonstrates that the hypocretin-1 peptide level in the frontal brain peaks during dark as does prepro-hypocretin mRNA in the hypothalamus. However, in midbrain and brainstem tissue caudal to the hypothalamus, there was less circadian fluctuation and a tendency for higher levels during the light phase. These data suggest that regulation of the hypocretin system differs between brain areas.

AB  - Abstract
In the present study, we investigated the effects of low molecular weight chondroitin sulfate (LMWCS) on amyloid beta (Aβ)-induced neurotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro results showed that LMWCS blocked Aβ25–35-induced cell viability loss and apoptosis, decreased intracellular calcium concentration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) depolarization, and the protein expression of Caspase-3. During in vivo experiments, LMWCS improved the cognitive impairment induced by Aβ1–40, increased the level of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and decreased the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the mouse brain. Moreover, LMWCS decreased the density of pyramidal cells of CA1 regions, and suppressed the protein expression of Bax/Bcl-2 and Caspase-3, -9 in the hippocampus of mice. In conclusion, LMWCS possessed neuroprotective properties against toxic effects induced by Aβ peptides both in vitro and in vivo, which might be related to anti-apoptotic activity. LMWCS might be a useful preventive and therapeutic compound for Alzheimer’s disease.

AB  - Abstract
Rapid automatized naming (RAN) has been established to be a strong predictor of reading. Yet, the neural correlates underlying the RAN–reading relationship remain unknown. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine: (a) the extent to which RAN and reading activate similar brain regions (within subjects), (b) whether RAN and reading are directly related in the shared activity network outlined in (a), and (c) to what extent RAN neural activation predicts behavioral reading performance. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), university students (N = 15; Mean age = 20.6 years) were assessed on RAN (letters and digits) and single-word reading (words and non-words). The results revealed a common RAN–reading network that included regions associated with motor planning (cerebellum), semantic access (middle temporal gyrus), articulation (supplementary motor area, pre-motor), and grapheme–phoneme translation (supramarginal gyrus). We found differences between RAN and reading with respect to percent signal change (PSC) in phonological and orthographic regions, but not in articulatory regions. Significant correlations between the neural RAN and reading parameters were found primarily in motor/articulatory regions. Further, we found a unique relationship between in-scanner reading response time and RAN PSC in the left inferior frontal gyrus. Taken together, these findings support the notion that RAN and reading activate similar neural networks. However, the relationship between RAN and reading is primarily driven by commonalities in the motor-sequencing/articulatory processes.

AB  - Abstract
The effects of sensory loss on central processing in various sensory systems have already been described. The olfactory system holds the special ability to be activated by a sensorimotor act, without the presentation of an odor. In this study, we investigated brain changes related to chronic peripheral smell loss. We included 11 anosmic patients (eight female, three male; mean age, 43.5 years) with smell loss after an infection of the upper respiratory tract (mean disease duration, 4.64 years) and 14 healthy controls (seven female, seven male; mean age, 30.1 years) in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment with a sniffing paradigm. Data were analyzed using group-independent component analysis and functional connectivity analysis. Our results revealed a spatially intact olfactory network in patients, whereas major aberrations due to peripheral loss were observed in functional connectivity through a variety of distributed brain areas. This is the first study to show the re-organization caused by the lack of peripheral input. The results of this study indicate that anosmic patients hold the ability to activate an olfaction-related functional network through the sensorimotor component of odor-perception (sniffing). The areas involved were not different from those that emerged in healthy controls. However, functional connectivity appears to be different between the two groups, with a decrease in functional connectivity in the brain in patients with chronic peripheral sensory loss. We can further conclude that the loss of the sense of smell may induce far-reaching effects in the whole brain, which lead to compensatory mechanisms from other sensory systems due to the close interconnectivity of the olfactory system with other functional networks.

AB  - Abstract
Central GABAA receptors mediate GABAergic phasic and tonic inhibition. While synaptic αβγ GABAA receptors primarily mediate phasic inhibition, extrasynaptic αβδ receptors play an important role in mediating tonic inhibition. Etomidate is a general anesthetic that produces its effects by enhancing GABAA receptor activity. We previously showed that etomidate modulates the gating of oocyte-expressed αβγ and αβδ receptors with similar overall allosteric impact, but different pharmacological patterns. In αβγ receptors, etomidate enhances apparent GABA sensitivity (reduces GABA EC50), modestly increases maximal GABA efficacy, and slows current deactivation without affecting desensitization (Zhong et al., 2008). In αβδ receptors characterized by low GABA efficacy, etomidate dramatically increases responses to both low and maximal GABA. The effects of etomidate on desensitization and deactivation of αβδ receptors are unknown. To investigate the kinetic effects of etomidate on α1β3δ receptors of defined subunit arrangement, we expressed concatenated trimer (β3-α1-δ) and dimer (β3-α1) GABAA receptor subunit assemblies in human embryonic kidney (HEK)293T cells and recorded whole-cell voltage-clamp currents during rapid external solution exchanges. As expected, etomidate substantially increased maximal GABA-induced currents and prolonged deactivation. Moreover, desensitization was significantly decreased by etomidate. During prolonged GABA applications, etomidate enhanced steady-state currents more than peak currents. Thus, etomidate enhances tonic GABAergic inhibition through extrasynaptic αβδ receptors by both augmenting gating and reducing desensitization.

AB  - Abstract
Recently, ribbon synapses to the hair cells (HCs) in the cochlea have become a novel site of interest in the investigation of noise-induced cochlear lesions in adult rodents (Kujawa and Liberman, 2009; Lin et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012; Shi et al., 2013). Permanent noise-induced damage to this type of synapse can result in subsequent degeneration of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in the absence of permanent changes to hearing sensitivity. To verify whether noise exposure during an early developmental period produces a similar impact on ribbon synapses, the present study examined the damaging effects of noise exposure in neonatal Kunming mice. The animals received exposure to broadband noise at 105-decibel (dB) sound pressure level (SPL) for 2 h on either postnatal day 10 (P10d) or postnatal day 14 (P14d), and then hearing function (based on the auditory brainstem response (ABR)) and cochlear morphology were evaluated during either postnatal weeks 3–4 (P4w) or postnatal weeks 7–8 (P8w). There were no significant differences in the hearing threshold between noise-exposed and control animals, which suggests that noise did not cause permanent loss of hearing sensitivity. However, noise exposure did produce a significant loss of ribbon synapses, particularly in P14d mice, which continued to increase from P4w to P8w. Additionally, a corresponding reduction in the amplitude of compound action potential (CAP) was observed in the noise-exposed groups at P4w and P8w, and the CAP latency was elongated, indicating a change in synaptic function.

AB  - Abstract
So far, no effective disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) aiming at protecting or reversing neurodegeneration of the disease have been established yet. The present work aims to elucidate the effect of Harpagoside (abbreviated HAR), an iridoid glycosides purified from the Chinese medicinal herb Scrophularia ningpoensis, on neurodegeneration induced by β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) and the underlying molecular mechanism. Here we show that HAR exerts neuroprotective effects against Aβ neurotoxicity. Rats injected aggregated Aβ1–40 into the bilateral hippocampus displayed impaired spatial learning and memory ability in a Y-maze test and novel object recognition test, while HAR treatment ameliorated Aβ1–40-induced behavioral deficits. Moreover, administration of HAR increased the expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and activated the extracellular-regulated protein kinase (ERK) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) pathways both in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the Aβ1-40-insulted rat model. Furthermore, in cultured primary cortical neurons, Aβ1–42 induced significant decrease of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive neuron number and neurite outgrowth length, both of which were dose dependently increased by HAR. In addition, HAR pretreatment also significantly attenuated the decrease of cell viability in Aβ1–42-injured primary cortical neurons. Finally, when K252a, an inhibitor of Trk tyrosine kinases, and a BDNF neutralizing antibody were added to the culture medium 2 h prior to HAR addition, the protective effect of HAR on Aβ1–42-induced neurodegeneration in the primary cortical neuron was almost inhibited. Taken together, HAR exerting neuroprotection effect and ameliorating learning and memory deficit appears to be associated, at least in part, with up-regulation of BDNF content as well as activating its downstream signaling pathways, e.g., MAPK/PI3K pathways. It raises the possibility that HAR has potential to be a therapeutic agent against AD.

The frontostriatal system plays a critical role in emotional and cognitive control. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) influences the release of dopamine (DA) in the ventral striatum (VST), while catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) impacts DA availability in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Behavioral studies have already shown a genetic interaction of BDNF Val66Met and COMT Val158Met, but the interaction on the DA-related neural circuit has not been previously studied. Here we show, using functional magnetic resonance imaging in a sample of healthy human subjects, that BDNF and COMT epistatically interacted on the functional connectivity between the bilateral VST and the anterior cingulate cortex. Specifically, BDNF Val66Met impacted the VST-PFC functional connectivity in an inverted U-shaped in COMT Met carriers, while COMT Val homozygotes displayed a U-shaped. These data may be helpful elucidating the mechanism of the interaction between BDNF and COMT on the cognitive functions that are based in the frontostriatal system.

Our previous study has proved that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which is developed to treat type 2 diabetes, has a significant effect on neuroprotection against advanced glycation end product (AGE)-induced neuronal insult in vitro models of diabetes-related Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated and it is not clear whether GLP-1 receptor mediates the down-regulation effects on AGE-induced AD-like changes in vivo. This study aims to explore the effect and mechanisms of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) against the AGE-dependent signaling pathway both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we demonstrated that GLP-1RA could inhibit oxidative stress and repair mitochondrial damage in addition to decreasing tau hyperphosphorylation in PC12 cells treated with AGEs. Importantly, we first observed AGEs in the circulatory system could induce tau hyperphosphorylation after we injected AGEs (1 μg/kg bodyweight) into the mice tail vein. We found GLP-1RA could promote mitochondrial biogenesis and antioxidant system via regulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) signaling pathway in vivo besides down-regulating the activity of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) to reverse tau hyperphosphorylation directly. Collectively, our results suggest that GLP-1RA protects neurons against AGE-induced tau hyperphosphorylation via regulating GSK-3β and PGC-1α two cooperative signaling pathways.

AB  - Abstract
Many studies have investigated exercise therapy in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and have shown benefits in improving motor deficits. However, exercise does not slow down the progression of the disease or induce the revival of lost nigrostriatal neurons. To examine the dichotomy of behavioral improvement without the slowing or recovery of dopaminergic cell or terminal loss, we tested exercise therapy in an intervention paradigm where voluntary running wheels were installed half-way through our progressive PD mouse model. In our model, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is administered over 4 weeks with increased doses each week (8, 16, 24, 32-kg/mg). We found that after 4 weeks of MPTP treatment, mice that volunteered to exercise had behavioral recovery in several measures despite the loss of 73% and 53% tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) within the dorsolateral (DL) striatum and the substantia nigra (SN), respectively which was equivalent to the loss seen in the mice that did not exercise but were also administered MPTP for 4 weeks. Mice treated with 4 weeks of MPTP showed a 41% loss of vesicular monoamine transporter II (VMAT2), a 71% increase in the ratio of glycosylated/non-glycosylated dopamine transporter (DAT), and significant increases in glutamate transporters including VGLUT1, GLT-1, and excitatory amino acid carrier 1. MPTP mice that exercised showed recovery of all these biomarkers back to the levels seen in the vehicle group and showed less inflammation compared to the mice treated with MPTP for 4 weeks. Even though we did not measure tissue dopamine (DA) concentration, our data suggest that exercise does not alleviate motor deficits by sparing nigrostriatal neurons, but perhaps by stabilizing the extraneuronal neurotransmitters, as evident by a recovery of DA and glutamate transporters. However, suppressing inflammation could be another mechanism of this locomotor recovery. Although exercise will not be a successful treatment alone, it could supplement other pharmaceutical approaches to PD therapy.

AB  - Abstract
Mitochondrial fission is predominantly controlled by the activity of dynamin-related protein1 (Drp1), which has been reported to be involved in mitochondria apoptosis pathways. However, the role of Drp1 in a rat model of cardiac arrest remains unknown. In this study, we found that activation of Drp1 in the mitochondria was increased after cardiac arrest and inhibition of Drp1 by 1.2 mg/kg of mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (Mdivi-1) administration after the restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) significantly protected against cerebral ischemic injury, shown by the increased 72-h survival rate and improved neurological function. Moreover, the increase of the vital neuron and the reduction of cytochrome c (CytC) release, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) translocation and caspase-3 activation in the brain indicate that this protection might result from the suppression of neuron apoptosis. Altogether, these results indicated that Drp1 is activated after cardiac arrest and the inhibition of Drp1 is protective against cerebral ischemic injury in a rat of cardiac arrest model via inhibition of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.

AB  - Abstract
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be applied to modulate cortical phenomena. The modulation effect is dependent on the applied stimulation frequency. Repetition suppression (RS) has been demonstrated in the motor system using TMS with short suprathreshold 1-Hz stimulation trains repeated at long inter-train intervals. RS has been reported to occur in the resting motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) with respect to the first pulse in a train of stimuli. Although this RS in the motor system has been described in previous studies, the neuronal origin of the phenomenon is still poorly understood. The present study evaluated RS in three TMS-induced motor responses; resting and active MEPs as well as corticospinal silent periods (SPs) in order to clarify the mechanism behind TMS-induced RS. We studied 10 healthy right-handed subjects using trains of four stimuli with stimulation intensities of 120% of the resting motor threshold (rMT) and 120% of the silent period threshold for an SP duration of 30 ms (SPT30). Inter-trial interval was 20 s, with a 1-s inter-stimulus interval within the trains. We confirmed that RS appears in resting MEPs (p &lt; 0.001), whereas active MEPs did not exhibit RS (p &gt; 0.792). SPs, on the contrary, lengthened (p &lt; 0.001) indicating modulation of cortical inhibition. The effects of the two stimulation intensities exhibited a similar trend; however, the SPT30 evoked a more profound inhibitory effect compared to that achieved by rMT. Moreover, the resting MEP amplitudes and SP durations correlated (rho ⩽ −0.674, p &lt; 0.001) and the pre-TMS EMG level did not differ between stimuli in resting MEPs (F = 0.0, p ⩾ 0.999). These results imply that the attenuation of response size seen in resting MEPs might originate from increasing activity of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons which relay the characteristics of SPs.

AB  - Abstract
The association between a fit body and a fit brain in children has led to a rise of behavioral and neuroscientific research. Yet, the relation of cardiorespiratory fitness on premotor neurocognitive preparation with early visual processing has received little attention. Here, 41 healthy, lower and higher fit preadolescent children were administered a modified version of the Eriksen flanker task while electroencephalography (EEG) and behavioral measures were recorded. Event-related potentials (ERPs) locked to the stimulus onset with an earlier than usual baseline (−900/−800 ms) allowed investigation of both the usual post-stimulus (i.e., the P1, N1 and P2) as well as the pre-stimulus ERP components, such as the Bereitschaftspotential (BP) and the prefrontal negativity (pN component). At the behavioral level, aerobic fitness was associated response accuracy, with higher fit children being more accurate than lower fit children. Fitness-related differences selectively emerged at prefrontal brain regions during response preparation, with larger pN amplitude for higher than lower fit children, and at early perceptual stages after stimulus onset, with larger P1 and N1 amplitudes in higher relative to lower fit children. Collectively, the results suggest that the benefits of being aerobically fit appear at the stage of cognitive preparation prior to stimulus presentation and the behavioral response during the performance of a task that challenges cognitive control. Further, it is likely that enhanced activity in prefrontal brain areas may improve cognitive control of visuo-motor tasks, allowing for stronger proactive inhibition and larger early allocation of selective attention resources on relevant external stimuli.

AB  - Abstract
Recent research suggests a complex role for microglia not only in Parkinson’s disease but in other disorders involving alpha-synuclein aggregation, such as multiple system atrophy. In these neurodegenerative processes, the activation of microglia is a common pathological finding, which disturbs the homeostasis of the neuronal environment otherwise maintained, among others, by microglia. The term activation comprises any deviation from what otherwise is considered normal microglia status, including cellular abundance, morphology or protein expression. The microglial response during disease will sustain survival or otherwise promote cell degeneration. The novel concepts of alpha-synuclein being released and uptaken by neighboring cells, and their importance in disease progression, positions microglia as the main cell that can clear and handle alpha-synuclein efficiently. Microglia’s behavior will therefore be a determinant on the disease’s progression. For this reason we believe that the better understanding of microglia’s response to alpha-synuclein pathological accumulation across brain areas and disease stages is essential to develop novel therapeutic tools for Parkinson’s disease and other alpha-synucleinopathies. In this review we will revise the most recent findings and developments with regard to alpha-synuclein and microglia in Parkinson’s disease.

AB  - Abstract
Studies on sound perception show a tendency to overestimate the distance of an approaching sound source, leading to a faster reaction time compared to a receding sound source. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether motor preparation and execution change according to the perceived sound direction and distance, particularly when the sound falls inside the individual’s peripersonal space. In this study we developed several auditory stimuli by means of two speakers, generating sounds moving toward the perceiver but stopping at different distances from her/him. Participants were asked to raise their arms as soon as the sound stopped, and their premotor and motor movement components were recorded by means of electromyography (EMG). Error in locating the perceived sound distance was also measured by asking participants to walk to the point in space where they believed the sound had stopped. Results showed that action initiation was anticipated as a function of sound distance: the closer the sound, the earlier the movement onset, when the sound entered the subject’s peripersonal space. Less error for distance estimation was present when the sound was inside the peripersonal space with a modulation in the order of a few centimeters. Overall, our results reveal a link between perceptual bias in sound distance evaluation and peripersonal space, suggesting the presence of motor plan specificity.

AB  - Abstract
Convergent evidence suggests that the lateral frontal cortex is at the heart of a brain network subserving cognitive control. Recent theories assume a functional segregation along the rostro-caudal axis of the lateral frontal cortex based on differences in the degree of complexity of cognitive control. However, the functional contribution of specific rostral and caudal sub-regions remains elusive. Here we investigate the impact of disrupting rostral and caudal target regions on cognitive control processes, using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). Participants performed three different task-switching conditions that assessed differences in the degree of complexity of cognitive control processes, after temporally disrupting rostral, or caudal target regions, or a control region. Disrupting the rostral lateral frontal region specifically impaired behavioral performance of the most complex task-switching condition, in comparison to the caudal target region and the control region. These novel findings shed light on the neuroanatomical architecture supporting control over goal-directed behavior.

AB  - Abstract
Methylphenidate (MPH) is a widely prescribed stimulant drug for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents. Its use in this age group raises concerns regarding the potential interference with ongoing neurodevelopmental processes. Particularly the hippocampus is a highly plastic brain region that continues to develop postnatally and is involved in cognition and emotional behavior, functions known to be affected by MPH. In this study, we assessed whether hippocampal structure and function were affected by chronic oral MPH treatment and whether its effects were different in adolescent or adult rats. Using behavioral testing, resting-state functional MRI, post-mortem structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and immunohistochemistry, we assessed MPH’s effects on recognition memory, depressive-like behavior, topological features of functional connectivity networks, hippocampal shape and markers for hippocampal neurogenesis and proliferation. Object recognition memory was transiently impaired in adolescent treated rats, while in animals treated during adulthood, increased depressive-like behavior was observed. Neurogenesis was increased in adolescent treated rats, whereas cell proliferation was decreased following adult treatment. Adolescent treated rats showed inward shape deformations adjacent to ventral parahippocampal regions known to be involved in recognition memory, whereas such deformations were not observed in adult treated animals. Irrespective of the age of treatment, MPH affected topological features of ventral hippocampal functional networks. Thus, chronic oral treatment with a therapeutically relevant dose of MPH preferentially affected the ventral part of the hippocampus and induced contrasting effects in adolescent and adult rats. The differences in behavior were paralleled by opposite effects on adult neurogenesis and granule cell proliferation.

AB  - Abstract
The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is formed by the endothelial cells with specialized tight junctions (TJs) lining the blood vessels and astroglial endfeet surrounding the blood vessels. Although BBB disruption during brain insults leads to vasogenic edema as one of the primary steps in the epileptogenic process, little is known about the molecular and physiological events concerning vasogenic edema formation. In the present study, status epilepticus (SE) changed the expressions and subcellular localizations of TJ proteins (claudin-5, occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1)) in endothelial cells of the rat piriform cortex. Among TJ proteins, the alteration in ZO-1 expression was relevant to endothelin B (ETB) receptor-mediated endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation, which increased matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity. Indeed, BQ788 (an ETB receptor antagonist) effectively attenuated SE-induced vasogenic edema by inhibiting eNOS-mediated MMP-9 activation and ZO-1 protein degradation in endothelial cells, although astroglial endfeet were detached from endothelial cells. Therefore, we suggest that SE-induced ETB receptor/eNOS-mediated MMP-9 activation may lead to impairments of endothelial cell function via TJ protein degradation, which are involved in vasogenic edema formation independent of perivascular astroglial functions.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, progressive demyelinating disorder which affects the central nervous system (CNS) and is recognized as the major cause of nervous system disability in young adults. Enhancing myelin repair by stimulating endogenous progenitors is a main goal in efforts for MS treatment. Fingolimod (FTY720) which is administrated as an oral medicine for relapsing-remitting MS has direct effects on neural cells. In this study, we hypothesized if daily treatment with FTY720 enhances endogenous myelin repair in a model of local demyelination induced by lysolecithin (LPC). We examined the response of inflammatory cells as well as resident OPCs and evaluated the number of newly produced myelinating cells in animals which were under daily treatment with FTY720. FTY720 at doses 0.3 and 1 mg/kg decreased the inflammation score at the site of LPC injection and decreased the extent of demyelination. FTY720 especially at the lower dose increased the number of remyelinated axons and newly produced myelinating cells. These data indicate that repetitive treatment with FTY720, behind an anti-inflammatory effect, exerts beneficial effects on the process of endogenous repair of demyelinating insults.

AB  - Abstract
Acetylcholine (ACh) acts through nicotinic and muscarinic ACh receptors in the ventral midbrain and striatal areas to influence dopamine (DA) transmission. This cholinergic control of DA transmission is important for processes such as attention and motivated behavior, and is manipulated by nicotine in tobacco products. Identifying and characterizing the key ACh receptors involved in cholinergic control of DA transmission could lead to small molecule therapeutics for treating disorders involving attention, addiction, Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia. α6-Containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are highly and specifically expressed in midbrain DA neurons, making them an attractive drug target. Here, we used genetic, pharmacological, behavioral, and biophysical approaches to study this nAChR subtype. For many experiments, we used mice expressing mutant α6 nAChRs (“α6L9S” mice) that increase the sensitivity of these receptors to agonists such as ACh and nicotine. Taking advantage of a simple behavioral phenotype exhibited by α6L9S mice, we compared the ability of full versus partial α6∗ nAChR agonists to activate α6∗ nAChRs in vivo. Using local infusions of both agonists and antagonists into the brain, we demonstrate that neurons and nAChRs in the midbrain are sufficient to account for this behavioral response. To complement these behavioral studies, we studied the ability of in vivo α6∗ nAChR activation to support plasticity changes in midbrain DA neurons that are relevant to behavioral sensitization and addiction. By coupling local infusion of drugs and brain slice patch-clamp electrophysiology, we show that activating α6∗ nAChRs in midbrain DA areas is sufficient to enhance glutamatergic transmission in ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neurons. Together, these results from in vivo studies strongly suggest that α6∗ nAChRs expressed by VTA DA neurons are positioned to strongly influence both DA-mediated behaviors and the induction of synaptic plasticity by nicotine.

Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies consistently revealed contributions of fronto-parietal and related networks to the execution of a visuospatial judgment task, the so-called “Clock Task”. However, due to the low temporal resolution of fMRI, the exact cortical dynamics and timing of processing during task performance could not be resolved until now. In order to clarify the detailed cortical activity and temporal dynamics, 14 healthy subjects performed an established version of the “Clock Task”, which comprises a visuospatial task (angle discrimination) and a control task (color discrimination) with the same stimulus material, in an electroencephalography (EEG) experiment. Based on the time-resolved analysis of network activations (microstate analysis), differences in timing between the angle compared to the color discrimination task were found after sensory processing in a time window starting around 200 ms. Significant differences between the two tasks were observed in an analysis window from 192 ms to 776 ms. We divided this window in two parts: an early phase – from 192 ms to ∼440 ms, and a late phase – from ∼440 ms to 776 ms. For both tasks, the order of network activations and the types of networks were the same, but, in each phase, activations for the two conditions were dominated by differing network states with divergent temporal dynamics. Our results provide an important basis for the assessment of deviations in processing dynamics during visuospatial tasks in clinical populations.

AB  - Abstract
For several years Amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) has been considered the main pathogenetic factor of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). According to the so called Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis the increase of Aβ triggers a series of events leading to synaptic dysfunction and memory loss as well as to the structural brain damage in the later stage of the disease. However, several evidences suggest that this hypothesis is not sufficient to explain AD pathogenesis, especially considering that most of the clinical trials aimed to decrease Aβ levels have been unsuccessful. Moreover, Aβ is physiologically produced in the healthy brain during neuronal activity and it is needed for synaptic plasticity and memory. Here we propose a model interpreting AD pathogenesis as an alteration of the negative feedback loop between Aβ and its physiological receptors, focusing on alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7-nAchRs). According to this vision, when Aβ cannot exert its physiological function a negative feedback mechanism would induce a compensatory increase of its production leading to an abnormal accumulation that reduces α7-nAchR function, leading to synaptic dysfunction and memory loss. In this perspective, the indiscriminate Aβ removal might worsen neuronal homeostasis, causing a further impoverishment of learning and memory. Even if further studies are needed to better understand and validate these mechanisms, we believe that to deepen the role of Aβ in physiological conditions might represent the keystone to elucidate important aspects of AD pathogenesis.

AB  - Abstract
Tight junctions of the blood–brain barrier are composed of transmembrane and associated cytoplasmic proteins. The transmembrane claudin proteins form the primary seal between endothelial cells and junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs) regulate tight junction formation. We have previously shown that claudin-1, claudin-5, zonula occludens (ZO)-1, and ZO-2 exhibit differential developmental regulation from 60% of gestation up to maturity in adult sheep. The purpose of the current study was to examine developmental changes in claudin-3, -12, and JAM-A protein expression in cerebral cortices of fetuses at 60%, 80%, and 90% gestation, and in newborn and adult sheep. We also examined correlations between changes in endogenous cortisol levels and tight junction protein expression in cerebral cortices of the fetuses. Claudin-3, -12 and JAM-A expressions were determined by Western immunoblot. Claudin-3 and -12 were lower (P &lt; 0.01) at 60%, 80%, 90% and in newborns than in adults, and JAM-A was lower in adults than in fetuses at 80% and 90% gestation. Claudin-3 expression demonstrated a direct correlation with increasing plasma cortisol levels (r = 0.60, n = 15, P &lt; 0.02) in the fetuses. We conclude that: claudin-3, -12 and JAM-A are expressed as early as 60% of gestation in ovine cerebral cortices, exhibit differential developmental regulation, and that increasing endogenous glucocorticoids modulate claudin-3 expression in the fetus.

AB  - Abstract
Recently, the fascia innervation has become an important issue, particularly the existence of nociceptive fibers. Fascia can be a source of pain in several disorders such as fasciitis and non-specific low back pain. However, nothing is known about possible changes of the fascia innervation under pathological circumstances. This question is important, because theoretically pain from the fascia cannot only be due to increased nociceptor discharges, but also to a denser innervation of the fascia by nociceptive endings.

In this histological study, an inflammation was induced in the thoracolumbar fascia (TLF) of rats and the innervation by various fiber types compared between the inflamed and intact TLF. Although the TLF is generally considered to have proprioceptive functions, no corpuscular proprioceptors (Pacini and Ruffini corpuscles) were found. To obtain quantitative data, the length of fibers and free nerve endings were determined in the three layers of the rat TLF: inner layer (IL, adjacent to the multifidus muscle), middle layer (ML) and outer layer (OL). The main results were that the overall innervation density showed little change; however, there were significant changes in some of the layers. The innervation density was significantly decreased in the OL, but this change was partly compensated for by an increase in the IL. The density of substance P (SP)-positive – presumably nociceptive – fibers was significantly increased. In contrast, the postganglionic sympathetic fibers were significantly decreased.

In conclusion, the inflamed TLF showed an increase of presumably nociceptive fibers, which may explain the pain from a pathologically altered fascia. The meaning of the decreased innervation by sympathetic fibers is obscure at present. The lack of proprioceptive corpuscular receptors within the TLF does not preclude its role as a proprioceptive structure, because some of the free nerve endings may function as proprioceptors.

AB  - Abstract
Transgenic mouse lines are essential tools for understanding the connectivity, physiology and function of neuronal circuits, including those in the retina. This report compares transgene expression in the retina of a tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-red fluorescent protein (RFP) mouse line with three catecholamine-related Cre recombinase mouse lines [TH-bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-, TH-, and dopamine transporter (DAT)-Cre] that were crossed with a ROSA26-tdTomato reporter line. Retinas were evaluated and immunostained with commonly used antibodies including those directed to TH, GABA and glycine to characterize the RFP or tdTomato fluorescent-labeled amacrine cells, and an antibody directed to RNA-binding protein with multiple splicing to identify ganglion cells. In TH-RFP retinas, types 1 and 2 dopamine (DA) amacrine cells were identified by their characteristic cellular morphology and type 1 DA cells by their expression of TH immunoreactivity. In the TH-BAC-, TH-, and DAT-tdTomato retinas, less than 1%, ∼6%, and 0%, respectively, of the fluorescent cells were the expected type 1 DA amacrine cells. Instead, in the TH-BAC-tdTomato retinas, fluorescently labeled AII amacrine cells were predominant, with some medium diameter ganglion cells. In TH-tdTomato retinas, fluorescence was in multiple neurochemical amacrine cell types, including four types of polyaxonal amacrine cells. In DAT-tdTomato retinas, fluorescence was in GABA immunoreactive amacrine cells, including two types of bistratified and two types of monostratified amacrine cells. Although each of the Cre lines was generated with the intent to specifically label DA cells, our findings show a cellular diversity in Cre expression in the adult retina and indicate the importance of careful characterization of transgene labeling patterns. These mouse lines with their distinctive cellular labeling patterns will be useful tools for future studies of retinal function and visual processing.

AB  - Abstract
The present study was to investigate whether baicalin can prevent repeated exogenous corticosterone injection-induced depressive-like behaviors and explore its possible mechanisms. After a 21-day treatment with baicalin (10 and 20 mg/kg), sucrose preference in the sucrose preference test (SPT) and immobility time in forced swimming test (FST) were observed, serum corticosterone levels and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) contents in the hippocampus were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot were used to detect the mRNA and protein expression in the hippocampus. The results showed that 21-day cortiscosterone injections caused depressive-like behaviors in mice, including the reduced sucrose preference and increased duration of immobility. Baicalin reversed these behavioral changes described above and restored serum corticosterone levels. Additionally, baicalin up-regulated the mRNA and protein expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and BDNF, accompanied with the down-regulation of serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) in the hippocampus. Moreover, baicalin significantly increased the protein expression of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (11β-HSD2) in the hippocampus. The present results confirmed the antidepressant-like effects of baicalin in a mice model of depression induced by corticosterone and suggested that its mechanism was possibly involved in reducing serum corticosterone and thereby increasing BDNF in the hippocampus.

AB  - Abstract
The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) is part of the limbic system located in the rostral forebrain. BST is involved in behavioral, neuroendocrine and autonomic functions, including cardiovascular regulation. The angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor, AT1, was found in the BST, however its effects on the cardiovascular system and on single-unit responses have not been studied yet. In the present study, Ang II was microinjected into the BST of anesthetized rats and cardiovascular and single-unit responses were recorded simultaneously. Furthermore the responses were re-tested after the microinjection of a blocker of the AT1 receptor, losartan, into the BST. We found that microinjection of Ang II into the BST produced a pressor response of 11 ± 1 mmHg for a duration of 2–8 min. Ang II had no consistent effect on heart rate. It also produced two types of single-unit responses in the BST, short excitatory and long inhibitory. Blockade of AT1 receptors abolished both the cardiovascular and single-unit responses, indicating that the responses were mediated through AT1 receptors. These findings imply that Ang II may be utilized as a neurotransmitter and may play a role in returning blood pressure toward normal during hypotension.

AB  - Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Despite intense investigations, little is known about its pathological mediators. Here, we report the marked upregulation of RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) and eotaxin, chemokines that are involved in T cell trafficking, in the serum of hemiparkinsonian monkeys. Interestingly, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), a Parkinsonian toxin, increased the expression of RANTES and eotaxin in mouse microglial cells. The presence of NF-κB binding sites in promoters of RANTES and eotaxin and down-regulation of these genes by NEMO-binding domain (NBD) peptide, selective inhibitor of induced NF-κB activation, in MPP+-stimulated microglial cells suggest that the activation of NF-κB plays an important role in the upregulation of these two chemokines. Consistently, serum enzyme-linked immuno assay (ELISA) and nigral immunohistochemistry further confirmed that these chemokines were strongly upregulated in MPTP-induced hemiparkinsonian monkeys and that treatment with NBD peptides effectively inhibited the level of these chemokines. Furthermore, the microglial upregulation of RANTES in the nigra of hemiparkinsonian monkeys could be involved in the altered adaptive immune response in the brain as we observed greater infiltration of CD8+ T cells around the perivascular niche and deep brain parenchyma of hemiparkinsonian monkeys as compared to control. The treatment of hemiparkinsonian monkeys with NBD peptides decreased the microglial expression of RANTES and attenuated the infiltration of CD8+ T cells in nigra. These results indicate the possible involvement of chemokine-dependent adaptive immune response in Parkinsonism.

AB  - Abstract
Growing numbers of evidence indicate that cognitive impairments are part of clinical profile of childhood absence epilepsy. Little is known on neuropathological changes accompanied by cognitive deficits in absence epilepsy. The aim of the present study was to investigate age-dependent neuropathological changes accompanied by learning and memory impairments in Wistar Albino Glaxo from Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rat model of absence epilepsy. Experimental groups were divided into four groups of six rats of both WAG/Rij and Wistar strains with 2 and 6 months of age. The learning and memory performances were assessed using passive avoidance paradigm and neuropathological alterations were investigated by the evaluation of the number of dark neurons and apoptotic cells as well as the expression of caspase-3 in the neocortex, the hippocampus, and different regions of the thalamus. Results revealed a decline in learning and spatial memory of 6-month-old WAG/Rij rats compared to age-matched Wistar rats as well as 2-month-old WAG/Rij and Wistar rats. The mean number of dark neurons was significantly higher in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 areas as well as in the laterodorsal, centromedial, and reticular thalamic nuclei and the somatosensory cortex of 6-month-old WAG/Rij rats. In addition, a higher number of apoptotic cells as well as a higher expression of caspase-3 was observed in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions, the laterodorsal thalamic nucleus, and the somatosensory cortex of 6-month-old WAG/Rij rats compared to other animal groups. These results indicate significant enhancement of neuronal damage and cell death accompanied by memory deficits after seizure attacks in a rat model of absence epilepsy. Seizure-induced neuronal injury and death may underlie cognitive impairments in absence epilepsy.

AB  - Abstract
The prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) is a socially monogamous rodent species that forms pair bonds after mating. Recent data have shown that amphetamine (AMPH) is rewarding to prairie voles as it induces conditioned place preferences. Further, repeated treatment with AMPH impairs social bonding in adult prairie voles through a central dopamine (DA)-dependent mechanism. The present study examined the effects of neonatal exposure to AMPH on behavior and central DA activity in adult male prairie voles. Our data show that neonatal exposure to AMPH makes voles less social in an affiliation test during adulthood, but does not affect animals’ locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior. Neonatal exposure to AMPH also increases the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and DA transporter (DAT) mRNA expression in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the brain, indicating an increase in central DA activity. As DA has been implicated in AMPH effects on behavioral and cognitive functions, altered DA activity in the vole brain may contribute to the observed changes in social behavior.

AB  - Abstract
Low body weight gain and food intake are related to exhaustive training and overtraining; however, the molecular mechanisms responsible for these alterations remain unknown. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of running overtraining (OT) protocols performed downhill, uphill and without inclination on the inflammatory pathway in the mouse hypothalamus. The rodents were randomized into the control (C), overtrained by downhill running (OTR/down), overtrained by uphill running (OTR/up) and overtrained by running without inclination (OTR) groups. The body weights and food intake were recorded daily. The incremental load, exhaustive, rotarod and grip force tests were used to measure performance. At 36 h after the grip force test was performed at the end of OT protocols (i.e., week eight) and/or after a 2-week total recovery period (i.e., week 10), the hypothalamus and gastrocnemius were extracted for immunoblotting analysis. In addition, the serum was used to determine cytokine and leptin concentrations. From week 0 to week 8, the OTR/down group exhibited decreased body weight and food intake, and the OTR/up group increased their food intake. At week 10, the OTR/down group exhibited increased body weight, while the OTR group decreased their food intake. The OTR/down group exhibited increased IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, pSAPK/JNK and SOCS3 levels at week eight. The OTR/down, OTR/up and OTR groups exhibited increased IL-10 levels at week 10. The OTR/up group displayed increased pJAK2 levels at week eight. While the OTR/down group exhibited increased IL-1beta levels, the OTR/down and OTR/up groups exhibited increased IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels, but decreased IL-10 levels in the gastrocnemius at week eight. The three OT protocols increased the IL-1beta and IL-6 levels, but only the OTR/down and OTR/up groups had increased TNF-alpha levels in serum at week eight. The serum leptin levels were lower for the OTR group compared with the CT group at week eight. In conclusion, the OTR/down protocol induced transitory hypothalamic inflammation with concomitant reductions in the body weight and food intake. After the 2-week total recovery period, the OTR/down group had reversed the hypothalamic inflammation, with the concomitant normalization of the body weight and food intake.

AB  - Abstract
The rodent anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is critical for visceral pain and pain-related aversive response in chronic visceral hypersensitive (VH) state. Long-term potentiation (LTP), induced by theta burst stimulation (TBS) in the medial thalamus (MT)-ACC pathway, is blocked in VH rats. However, the neuronal intrinsic firing characteristics and the MT-ACC connectivity have not been investigated in visceral pain.

Using repetitive distension of the colon and rectum (rCRD) as a sensitization paradigm, we have identified that the spontaneous firing rates of ACC neurons and the CRD-stimulated neuronal firings were increased after repetitive visceral noxious stimulation. This correlates with increases in visceral pain responses (visceromotor responses, VMRs).

Two multichannel arrays of electrodes were implanted in the MT and ACC. Recordings were performed in free-moving rats before and after repeated CRD treatment. Power spectral density analysis showed that the local field potential (LFP) recorded in the ACC displayed increases in theta band power (4–10 Hz) that were modulated by rCRD. Neural spike activity in the ACC becomes synchronized with ongoing theta oscillations of LFP. Furthermore, cross correlation analysis showed augmented synchronization of thalamo-ACC theta band LFPs, which was consistent with an increase of neuronal communication between the two regions.

In conclusion, these results reveal theta oscillations and theta-frequency phase-locking as prominent features of neural activity in the ACC and a candidate neural mechanism underlying acute visceral pain.

AB  - Abstract
C-terminal binding proteins (CtBPs) are transcriptional co-repressors which cooperate with a variety of transcription factors to repress gene expression. Caenorhabditis elegans CTBP-1 expression has been observed in the nervous system and hypodermis. In C. elegans, CTBP-1 regulates several processes including Acute Functional Tolerance to ethanol and functions in the nervous system to modulate both lifespan and expression of a lipase gene called lips-7.

Incorrect structure and/or function of the nervous system can lead to behavioral changes. Here, we demonstrate reduced exploration behavior in ctbp-1 mutants. Our examination of a subset of neurons involved in regulating locomotion revealed that the axonal morphology of dorsal SMD (SMDD) neurons is altered in ctbp-1 mutants at the fourth larval (L4) stage. Expressing CTBP-1 under the control of the endogenous ctbp-1 promoter rescued both the exploration behavior phenotype and defective SMDD axon structure in ctbp-1 mutants at the L4 stage. Interestingly, the pre-synaptic marker RAB-3 was found to localize to the mispositioned portion of SMDD axons in a ctbp-1 mutant. Further analysis of SMDD axonal morphology at days 1, 3 and 5 of adulthood revealed that the number of ctbp-1 mutants showing an SMDD axonal morphology defect increases in early adulthood and the observed defect appears to be qualitatively more severe. CTBP-1 is prominently expressed in the nervous system with weak expression detected in the hypodermis. Surprisingly, solely expressing CTBP-1a in the nervous system or hypodermis did not restore correct SMDD axonal structure in a ctbp-1 mutant. Our results demonstrate a role for CTBP-1 in exploration behavior and the regulation of SMDD axonal morphology in C. elegans.

AB  - Abstract
Epilepsy is a life-shortening brain disorder affecting approximately 1% of the worldwide population. Most epilepsy patients are refractory to currently available antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Knowledge about the mechanisms underlying seizure activity and probing for new AEDs is fundamental to the discovery of new therapeutic strategies. Brain Na+, K+-ATPase activity contributes to the maintenance of the electrochemical gradients underlying neuronal resting and action potentials as well as the uptake and release of neurotransmitters. Accordingly, a decrease of Na+, K+-ATPase increases neuronal excitability and may predispose to appearing of seizure activity. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that activation of Na+, K+-ATPase activity with a specific antibody (DRRSAb) raised against a regulatory site in the α subunit would decrease seizure susceptibility. We found that incubation of hippocampal homogenates with DRRSAb (1 μM) increased total and α1 Na+, K+-ATPase activities. A higher concentration (3 μM) increased total, α1 and α2/α3 Na+, K+-ATPase activities. Intrahippocampal injection of DRRSAb decreased the susceptibility of post status epilepticus animals to pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced myoclonic seizures. In contrast, administration of DRRSAb into the hippocampus of naïve animals facilitated the appearance of PTZ-induced seizures. Quantitative analysis of hippocampal electroencephalography (EEG) recordings revealed that DRRSAb increased the percentage of total power contributed by the delta frequency band (0–3 Hz) to a large irregular amplitude pattern of hippocampal EEG. On the other hand, we found no DRRSAb-induced changes regarding the theta functional state. Further studies are necessary to define the potential of Na+, K+-ATPase activation as a new therapeutic approach for seizure disorders.

AB  - Abstract
While amyloid beta (Aβ) plays a central role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), recent evidence suggests the involvement of arginine metabolism in AD pathogenesis. Earlier research has shown that a single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of pre-aggregated Aβ25–35 (the neurotoxic domain of the full-length Aβ) altered arginine metabolism in the rat hippocampus (particularly the CA2/3 and dentate gyrus (DG) sub-regions) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) at the time point of 8 days post-infusion. The present study measured the levels of l-arginine and its nine downstream metabolites (l-citrulline, l-ornithine, agmatine, putrescine, spermidine, spermine, glutamate, GABA and glutamine) in the hippocampus and PFC at the time points of 42 and 97 days following a single bilateral i.c.v. infusion of Aβ25–35 (30 nmol/rat) or Aβ35–25 (reverse peptide; 30 nmol/rat). At the 42-day time point, Aβ25–35 resulted in decreased levels of glutamate, glutamine and spermine in the CA2/3 sub-region of the hippocampus. At the 97-day time point, however, there were decreased l-ornithine, GABA and putrescine levels, but increased glutamate/GABA ratio, in the PFC and increased spermine levels in the DG sub-region. Cluster analyses showed that l-arginine and its three main metabolites l-citrulline, l-ornithine and agmatine formed distinct groups, which changed as a function of Aβ25–35 at the 42-day and 97-day time points, particularly in the CA2/3 and PFC regions respectively. This study, for the first time, demonstrates that a single i.c.v. infusion of pre-aggregated Aβ25–35 leads to prolonged alterations in arginine metabolism in a region-specific and time-dependent manner, which further supports the involvement of arginine metabolism in AD pathogenesis.

AB  - Abstract
We have recently reported on the efficacy of an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor partial antagonist, S-Methyl-N,N-diethylthiolcarbamate sulfoxide (DETC-MeSO), in improving outcome following stroke, including reduced infarct size and calcium influx, suppressing the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis as well as improving behavioral outcome. DETC-MeSO was shown to suppress the protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) pathway, one of the major ER stress pathways. Several studies including ours have provided evidence that taurine also has neuroprotective effects through reducing apoptosis and inhibiting activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE-1) pathways. We hypothesized that a combined treatment with DETC-MeSO and taurine would ameliorate ischemia-induced brain injury by inhibiting all three ER stress pathways. Twenty four hours following reperfusion of a 2-h ischemic stroke, rats received either 0.56-mg/kg DETC-MeSO or 40-mg/kg of taurine, either alone or in combination, subcutaneously for 4 days. Our study showed that combined DETC-MeSO and taurine, but not DETC-MeSO alone at the dose used, greatly reduced the infarct size, improved performance on the neuro-score test and attenuated proteolysis of αII-spectrin. Meanwhile, the level of the pro-apoptotic protein, Bax, declined and the anti-apoptotic protein, B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), expression was markedly increased. Combination therapy decreased both caspase-12 and caspase-3 activation by preventing the release of Cytochrome-c from mitochondria, indicating attenuation of apoptosis in ischemic infarct. Glucose-regulated protein (GRP)78 as a marker of the unfolded protein response decreased and levels of the key ER stress protein markers p-PERK-ATF4, p-eIF2α and cleaved-ATF-6 were found to significantly decline. NeuN expression levels indicated that more neurons were protected in the presence of DETC-MeSO and taurine. We also showed that combined treatment can prevent gliosis and increase p-AKT a pro-survival marker in the penumbra. Therefore, we conclude that combined treatment with both DETC-MeSO and taurine synergistically inhibits all three ER stress pathways and apoptosis and therefore can be a novel and effective treatment after ischemic stroke.

AB  - Abstract
Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) have important functions in development of the central nervous system; however, their functions in nerve injury are not yet fully understood. We previously reported the expression of syndecan-1, a type of HSPG, in cranial motor neurons after nerve injury, suggesting the importance of syndecan-1 in the pathology of motor nerve injury. In this study, we examined the expression of syndecan-1, a type of HSPG, in primary sensory neurons after nerve injury in mice. Sciatic nerve axotomy strongly induced the expression of syndecan-1 in a subpopulation of injured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, which were small in size and had CGRP- or isolectin B4-positive fibers. Syndecan-1 was also distributed in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord ipsilateral to the axotomy, and located on the membrane of axons in lamina II of the dorsal horn. Not only sciatic nerve axotomy, infraorbital nerve axotomy also induced the expression of syndecan-1 in trigeminal ganglion neurons. Moreover, syndecan-1 knockdown in cultured DRG neurons induced a shorter neurite extension. These results suggest that syndecan-1 expression in injured primary sensory neurons may have functional roles in nerve regeneration and synaptic plasticity, resulting in the development of neuropathic pain.

AB  - Abstract
Physiological significance of synaptic Zn2+ signaling was examined in the CA1 of young rats. In vivo CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced using a recording electrode attached to a microdialysis probe and the recording region was locally perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) via the microdialysis probe. In vivo CA1 LTP was inhibited under perfusion with CaEDTA and ZnAF-2DA, extracellular and intracellular Zn2+ chelators, respectively, suggesting that the influx of extracellular Zn2+ is required for in vivo CA1 LTP induction. The increase in intracellular Zn2+ was chelated with intracellular ZnAF-2 in the CA1 1 h after local injection of ZnAF-2DA into the CA1, suggesting that intracellular Zn2+ signaling induced during learning is blocked with intracellular ZnAF-2 when the learning was performed 1 h after ZnAF-2DA injection. Object recognition was affected when training of object recognition test was performed 1 h after ZnAF-2DA injection. These data suggest that intracellular Zn2+ signaling in the CA1 is required for object recognition memory via LTP. Surprisingly, in vivo CA1 LTP was affected under perfusion with 0.1–1 μM ZnCl2, unlike the previous data that in vitro CA1 LTP was enhanced in the presence of 1–5 μM ZnCl2. The influx of extracellular Zn2+ into CA1 pyramidal cells has bidirectional action in CA1 LTP. The present study indicates that the degree of extracellular Zn2+ influx into CA1 neurons is critical for LTP and cognitive performance.

AB  - Abstract
Secondary death of neural cells plays a key role in the physiopathology and the functional consequences of traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). Pharmacological manipulation of cell death pathways leading to the preservation of neural cells is acknowledged as a main therapeutic goal in SCI. In the present work, we hypothesize that administration of the neuroprotective cell-permeable compound ucf-101 will reduce neural cell death during the secondary damage of SCI, increasing tissue preservation and reducing the functional deficits. To test this hypothesis, we treated mice with ucf-101 during the first week after a moderate contusive SCI. Our results reveal that ucf-101 administration protects neural cells from the deleterious secondary mechanisms triggered by the trauma, reducing the extension of tissue damage and improving motor function recovery. Our studies also suggest that the effects of ucf-101 may be mediated through the inhibition of HtrA2/OMI and the concomitant increase of inhibitor of apoptosis protein XIAP, as well as the induction of ERK1/2 activation and/or expression. In vitro assays confirm the effects of ucf-101 on both pathways as well as on the reduction of caspase cascade activation and apoptotic cell death in a neuroblastoma cell line. These results suggest that ucf-101 can be a promising therapeutic tool for SCI that deserves more detailed analyses.

AB  - Abstract
Steroid positive-feedback activation of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)–pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) neuroendocrine axis propagates the pre ovulatory LH surge, a crucial component of female reproduction. Our work shows that this key event is restrained by inhibitory metabolic input from hindbrain A2 noradrenergic neurons. GnRH neurons express the ultra-sensitive energy sensor adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK); here, we investigated the hypothesis that GnRH nerve cell AMPK and peptide neurotransmitter responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia are controlled by hindbrain lack of the oxidizable glycolytic end-product l-lactate. Data show that hypoglycemic inhibition of LH release in steroid-primed ovariectomized female rats was reversed by coincident caudal hindbrain lactate infusion. Western blot analyses of laser-microdissected A2 neurons demonstrate hypoglycemic augmentation [Fos, estrogen receptor-beta (ER-β), phosphoAMPK (pAMPK)] and inhibition (dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, GLUT3, MCT2) of protein expression in these cells, responses that were normalized by insulin plus lactate treatment. Hypoglycemia diminished rostral preoptic GnRH nerve cell GnRH-I protein and pAMPK content; the former, but not the latter response was reversed by lactate. Results implicate caudal hindbrain lactoprivic signaling in hypoglycemia-induced suppression of the LH surge, demonstrating that lactate repletion of that site reverses decrements in A2 catecholamine biosynthetic enzyme and GnRH neuropeptide precursor protein expression. Lack of effect of lactate on hypoglycemic patterns of GnRH AMPK activity suggests that this sensor is uninvolved in metabolic-inhibition of positive-feedback-stimulated hypophysiotropic signaling to pituitary gonadotropes.

AB  - Abstract
The amygdala is a heterogeneous group of nuclei that plays a role in emotional and social learning. As such, there has been increased interest in its development in adolescent animals, a period in which emotional/social learning increases dramatically. While many mechanisms of amygdala development have been studied, the role of cell proliferation during adolescence has received less attention. Using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) injections in adolescent and adult rats, we previously found an almost fivefold increase in BrdU-positive cells in the amygdala of adolescents compared to adults. Approximately one third of BrdU-labeled cells in the amygdala contained the putative neural marker doublecortin (DCX), suggesting a potential for neurogenesis. To further investigate this possibility in adolescents, we examined the proliferative dynamics of DCX/BrdU-labeled cells. Surprisingly, DCX/BrdU-positive cells were found to comprise a stable subpopulation of BrdU-containing cells across survivals up to 56 days, and there was no evidence of neural maturation by 28 days after BrdU injection. Additionally, we found that approximately 50% of BrdU+ cells within the adolescent amygdala contain neural-glial antigen (NG2) and are therefore presumptive oligodendrocyte precursors (OPCs). We next characterized the response to a short-lived stressor (3-day repeated variable stress, RVS). The total BrdU-labeled cell number decreased by ∼30% by 13 days following RVS (10 days post-BrdU injection) as assessed by stereologic counting methods, but the DCX/BrdU-labeled subpopulation was relatively resistant to RVS effects. In contrast, NG2/BrdU-labeled cells were strongly influenced by RVS. We conclude that typical neurogenesis is not a feature of the adolescent amygdala. These findings point to several possibilities, including the possibility that DCX/BrdU cells are late-developing neural precursors, or a unique subtype of NG2 cell that is relatively resistant to stress. In contrast, many proliferating OPCs are significantly impacted by a short-lived stressor, suggesting consequences for myelination in the developing amygdala.

AB  - Abstract
Epileptogenesis refers to the development and extension of tissue capable of generating spontaneous seizures, resulting in the development of an epileptic condition and/or progression of epilepsy after the condition is established. The hippocampus is the seizure-initiating zone in many epilepsy patients as well as in animal models of epilepsy. During epileptogenesis, the hippocampus undergoes structural changes, including mossy fiber sprouting; alterations in dendritic branching, spine density, and shape; and neurogenesis. In vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques provide insights into the microstructural organization of the hippocampus. An assessment of the structural plasticity of the hippocampus may provide parameters that could be used as biomarkers for epileptogenesis. Here we review conventional and more advanced MRI methods for detecting hippocampal tissue changes related to epileptogenesis. In addition, we summarize how diffusion tensor imaging can reveal cellular damage and plasticity, even at the level of hippocampal subfields. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions for using novel MRI techniques in the search of biomarkers associated with epileptogenesis after brain injury.

AB  - Abstract
It has been proposed that thalamic mediodorsal (MD) and ventromedial (VM) nuclei form thalamic ‘nociceptive discriminators’ in discrimination of nociceptive afferents, and specifically govern endogenous descending facilitation and inhibition. The present study conducted in rats was to explore the role of thalamic MD and VM nuclei in modulation of cerebral neuronal activities by means of detection of spatiotemporal variations of Fos expression within the cerebral cortex. Following a unilateral intramuscular injection of 5.8% saline into the gastrocnemius muscle, Fos expression within the bilateral, different areas of the cerebral cortex except S2 was significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05). Particularly, the increases in Fos expression within the cingulate cortex and the insular cortex occurred at 0.5 h, 4 h and reached the peak level at 4 h, 16 h, respectively. Electrolytic lesion of the contralateral thalamic MD and VM nuclei significantly blocked the 5.8% saline intramuscularly induced increases in Fos expression within the bilateral cingulate and insular cortices, respectively. Additionally, the 5.8% saline-induced Fos expression in the cingulate cortex and the insular cortex were dose-dependently attenuated by microinjection of μ-opioid antagonist β-funaltrexamine hydrochloride into the thalamic MD and VM nuclei. It is suggested that (1) the neural circuits of ‘thalamic MD nucleus – cingulate cortex’ and ‘thalamic VM nucleus – insular cortex’ form two distinct pathways in the endogenous control of nociception, (2) mirror or contralateral pain is hypothesized to be related to cross-talk of neuronal activities within the bilateral cerebral cortices modulated by μ-opioid receptors within the thalamic MD and VM nuclei.

AB  - Abstract
Prenatal stress (PS) can induce several long-lasting behavioral and molecular abnormalities in rats. It can also be considered as a risk factor for many psychiatric diseases like schizophrenia, depression or PTSD and predispose to addiction.

In this study, we investigated the effect of prenatal stress on the reinforcing properties of nicotine in the CPP paradigm. Then, we examined the mRNA expression of the D2 dopaminergic receptors using the quantitative real-time PCR technique in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). We found that prenatally stressed rats exhibited a greater place preference for the nicotine-paired compartment than the control rats. Moreover, we observed an overexpression of the DRD2 gene in adult offspring stressed in utero and a downregulation in the PS NIC group (PS rats treated with nicotine) compared with their control counterparts (C NIC).

These data suggest that maternal stress can permanently alter the offspring’s addictive behavior and D2 receptors’ expression.

AB  - Abstract
The regulation of post-ischemic hyperglycemia plays an important role in suppressing neuronal damage in therapeutic strategies for cerebral ischemia. We previously reported that the cerebral sodium-glucose transporter (SGLT) was involved in the post-ischemic hyperglycemia-induced exacerbation of cerebral ischemic neuronal damage. Cortical SGLT-1, one of the cerebral SGLT isoforms, is dramatically increased by focal cerebral ischemia. In this study, we focused on the involvement of cerebral SGLT-1 in the development of cerebral ischemic neuronal damage. It was previously reported that activation of 5′-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) increases SGLT-1 expression. Moreover, ischemic stress-induced activation of AMPK exacerbates cerebral ischemic neuronal damage. Therefore, we directly confirmed the relationship between cerebral SGLT-1 and cerebral AMPK activation using in vitro primary culture of mouse cortical neurons. An in vivo mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia was generated using a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). The development of infarct volume and behavioral abnormalities on day 3 after MCAO were ameliorated in cerebral SGLT-1 knock down mice. Cortical and striatal SGLT-1 expression levels were significantly increased at 12 h after MCAO. Immunofluorescence revealed that SGLT-1 and the neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN) were co-localized in the cortex and striatum of MCAO mice. In the in vitro study, primary cortical neurons were cultured for five days before each treatment with reagents. Concomitant treatment with hydrogen peroxide and glucose induced the elevation of SGLT-1 and phosphorylated AMPK/AMPK ratio, and this elevation was suppressed by compound C, an AMPK inhibitor in primary cortical neurons. Moreover, compound C suppressed neuronal cell death induced by concomitant hydrogen peroxide/glucose treatment in primary cortical neurons. Therefore, we concluded that enhanced cerebral SGLT-1 function mediated by post-ischemic hyperglycemia exacerbates the development of cerebral ischemic neuronal damage. One of the mechanisms of cerebral SGLT-1 up-regulation may be involved in the AMPK activation after cerebral ischemia.

AB  - Abstract
Assessment of awareness in patients with disorders of consciousness such as patients in a vegetative state (unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, UWS) and patients in a minimally conscious state (MCS) remains difficult, with a high rate of misdiagnosis (around 40%). While patients with UWS have no awareness, patients with MCS have partial preservation of conscious awareness. To improve the assessment of awareness in these patients, recent functional neuroimaging protocols have been developed. However, does the complexity of realizing and interpreting these functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) investigation protocols, which are currently carried out by only a few specialist teams, permit generalizable use in clinical routine?

In this study, 32 healthy volunteers, by definition perfectly conscious and able to efficiently communicate, performed the protocol proposed by Monti et al. in 2010. Four methods (comprising the method proposed by Monti et al., a mean squared error-based method, a correlation-based method, and a support vector machine-based method) were tested for correctly and accurately interpreting the communication task.

Firstly, the different instructions for the localizer and the communication tasks had no effect on activations. Secondly, 25% of participants (8/32) did not provide the expected patterns of activations during fMRI tasks (four for each imagery task). However, this did not necessarily prevent the classification methods from correctly guessing the answers during the communication task. Conversely, these classification methods may fail to detect the correct answers even though participants activated the expected brain areas. None of the four methods produced 100% correct detection during the communication phases. The correlation-based method obtained the best results with an error rate of 4.2%.

The results of this study demonstrate that fMRI-based communication paradigms may not be robust enough to reliably detect awareness in all aware patients. There is still a need to develop new statistical and analytical methods before considering their generalization in clinical routine.

AB  - Abstract
Background: People with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) also have poorer fundamental motor skills. The development of postural control underlies both social and motor skills. All three elements are facilitated by the active use of visual information. This study compares how adults with ASD and typically developed adults (TDAs) respond to a postural illusion induced using neck vibration. Adults with ASD unlike the TDA, were not expected to correct the illusion using vision. Methods: The study used intermittent (15off, 5on) posterior neck vibration during 200 s of quiet stance to induce a postural illusion. In TDAs and only in the absence of vision this protocol induces a forward body lean. Participants (12 ASD, 20 TDA) undertook four conditions combining vibration and visual occlusion. Results: As predicted, TDA were only affected by the postural illusion when vision was occluded (vibration condition: vision occluded (n = 1) p = 0.0001; vision available (n = 3) p &gt; 0.2466). Adults with ASD were affected by the postural illusion regardless of the availability of vision (all conditions p &lt; 0.0007). Conclusions: Our findings indicated the adults with ASD did not use visual information to control standing posture. In light of existing evidence that vision-for-perception is processed typically in ASD, our findings support a specific deficit in vision-for-action. These findings may explain why individuals with ASD experience difficulties with both social and motor skills since both require vision-for-action. Further research needs to investigate the division of these visual learning pathways in order to provide more specific intervention opportunities in ASD.

AB  - Abstract
Intrathecal delivery of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) reverses mechanical allodynia after 5th lumbar (L5) spinal nerve ligation (SNL). However, the molecular mechanism behind this process is not fully understood. Following sciatic nerve injury, primary afferent neurons in the injured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) begin to express neuropeptide Y (NPY) that is absent in normal DRG. The aim of the current study was to determine the relationship of this de novo expression of NPY and the anti-allodynic effect of GDNF. Following L5 SNL, 73% of neurons began to express NPY mRNA in the ipsilateral L5 DRG and robust NPY-immunoreactive fibers appeared in the ipsilateral GN where the touch-sense mediating A-fiber primary afferents from the hindpaw terminate. Seven-daylong intrathecal infusion of GDNF at the L5 DRG level, starting on day three when mechanical allodynia had fully developed, reversed once-established these changes. The GN neurons normally expressed NPY Y1 receptor, but not Y2, Y4, or Y5 receptors, and L5 SNL did not change the expression pattern. Bolus intracisternal injection of BIBP3226, a Y1 receptor antagonist, dose-dependently reversed mechanical allodynia. We demonstrated that GDNF reversed once-established mechanical allodynia as well as NPY induction in the touch-sense processing pathway. NPY could facilitate touch-sense processing by Y1 receptor in the gracile nucleus after peripheral nerve injury. GDNF may exert anti-allodynic effects through mitigation of this NPY up-regulation. The effectiveness of delayed treatment further indicates the therapeutic potential of GDNF on neuropathic pain.

AB  - Abstract
Introduction: Freezing of gait (FoG) is a debilitating gait disorder in Parkinson’s disease (PD). In advanced PD patients with FoG, the supraspinal locomotor network may be dysregulated (relative to similar patients without FoG) during gait. Here, we sought to characterize the metabolism of locomotor networks involved in FoG. Methods: Twenty-two PD patients (11 with off-drug FoG and 11 without) each underwent two [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET brain scans in the off-drug state: one at rest and another during radiotracer uptake while performing a standardized gait trajectory that incorporated the usual triggers for FoG. Results: For the 11 freezers, FoG was present for 39% (±23%) of the time during the gait trajectory. The FoG-associated abnormalities were characterized by (i) hypometabolism in frontal regions (the associative premotor, temporopolar and orbitofrontal areas, i.e. Brodmann areas 6 and 8), (ii) hypermetabolism in the paracentral lobule (Brodmann area 5), and (iii) deregulation of the basal ganglia output (the globus pallidus and the mesencephalic locomotor region). Conclusion: FoG during a real gait task was associated with impaired frontoparietal cortical activation, as characterized by abnormally low metabolic activity of the premotor area (involved in the indirect locomotor pathway) and abnormally high metabolic activity of the parietal area (reflecting the harmful effect of external cueing).

AB  - Abstract
In rat thalamic paraventricular nucleus of thalamus (PVT) neurons, activation of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptors enhances excitability via concurrent decrease in G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium (GIRK)-like and activation of transient receptor potential cation (TRPC)4/5-like cationic conductances. An exploration of intracellular signaling pathways revealed the TRH-induced current to be insensitive to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) inhibitors, but reduced by D609, an inhibitor of phosphatidylcholine-specific PLC (PC-PLC). A corresponding change in the I–V relationship implied suppression of the cationic component of the TRH-induced current. Diacylglycerol (DAG) is a product of the hydrolysis of PC. Studies focused on the isolated cationic component of the TRH-induced response revealed a reduction by RHC80267, an inhibitor of DAG lipase, the enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of DAG to the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Further investigation revealed enhancement of the cationic component in the presence of either JZL184 or WWL70, inhibitors of enzymes involved in the hydrolysis of 2-AG. A decrease in the TRH-induced response was noted in the presence of rimonabant or SR144528, membrane permeable CB1 and CB2 receptor antagonists, respectively. A decrease in the TRH-induced current by intracellular, but not by bath application of the membrane impermeable peptide hemopressin, selective for CB1 receptors, suggests a postsynaptic intracellular localization of these receptors. The TRH-induced current was increased in the presence of arachidonyl-2′-chloroethylamide (ACEA) or JWH133, CB1 and CB2 receptor agonists, respectively. The PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, known to inhibit TRPC translocation, decreased the response to TRH. In addition, a TRH-induced enhancement of the low-threshold spike was prevented by both rimonabant, and SR144528. TRH had no influence on excitatory or inhibitory miniature postsynaptic currents, suggesting presynaptic CB receptors are not involved in this situation. Collectively, the data imply that activation of TRH receptors in these midline thalamic neurons engages novel signaling pathways that include postsynaptic intracellular CB1 and CB2 receptors in the activation of TRPC4/5-like channels.

AB  - Abstract
β-Site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) initiates the generation of amyloid-β (Aβ), thus representing a prime therapeutic target for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Previous work including ours has used BACE1 haploinsufficiency (BACE1+/−; i.e., 50% reduction) as a therapeutic relevant model to evaluate the efficacy of partial β-secretase inhibition. However, it is unclear whether the extent of Aβ reductions in amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice with BACE1+/− gene ablation may vary with sex or disease progression. Here, we compared the impacts of BACE1 haploinsufficiency on Aβ concentrations and APP processing in 5XFAD Alzheimer mice (1) between males and females and (2) between different stages with moderate and robust Aβ accumulation. First, male and female 5XFAD mice at 6–7 months of age showed equivalent levels of Aβ, BACE1, full-length APP and its metabolites. BACE1 haploinsufficiency significantly lowered soluble Aβ oligomers, total Aβ42 levels and plaque burden in 5XFAD mouse brains irrespective of sex. Furthermore, there was no sex difference in reductions of β-cleavage products of APP (C99 and sAPPβ) found in BACE1+/−·5XFAD mice relative to BACE1+/+·5XFAD controls. Meanwhile, APP and sAPPα levels in BACE1+/−·5XFAD mice were higher than those of 5XFAD controls regardless of sex. Based on these observations, we next combined male and female data to examine the effects of BACE1 haploinsufficiency in 5XFAD mice at 12–14 months of age, as compared with those in 6–7-month-old 5XFAD mice. Oligomeric Aβ and C99 levels were dramatically elevated in older 5XFAD mice. Although the β-metabolites of APP were significantly reduced by BACE1 haploinsufficiency in both age groups, high levels of these toxic amyloidogenic fragments remained in 12–14-month-old BACE1+/−·5XFAD mice. The present findings are consistent with our previous behavioral data showing that BACE1 haploinsufficiency rescues memory deficits in 5XFAD mice irrespective of sex but only in the younger age group.

AB  - Abstract
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a key role in neuronal development, synaptic plasticity, and the central control of energy homeostasis. Peripheral metabolic signals such as leptin and glucose regulate hypothalamic BDNF gene expression. However, the effects of long-term hyperglycemia and/or hyperinsulinemia on BDNF mRNA levels in the hypothalamus and other brain regions where BDNF regulates physiological functions have not been investigated. Therefore, using in situ hybridization we examined whether high glucose, high insulin, or both affected BDNF gene expression in vivo. Ovariectomized, estrogen-replaced adult rats were fitted with indwelling jugular catheters and infused for 48 h with: saline (control), glucose (hyperglycemia–hyperinsulinemia), glucose with insulin (hyperinsulinemia only), diazoxide (Dzx) (control), or glucose with Dzx (hyperglycemia only). Glucose infusion (Hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia) significantly increased BDNF mRNA expression in the posterior ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (pVMH) and in the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (DMH). Unexpectedly, infusion of the KATP channel opener Dzx also increased BDNF mRNA expression in the pVMH and DMH. In contrast, no significant changes in BDNF mRNA expression were observed in the groups that were hyperinsulinemic only or hyperglycemic only. BDNF mRNA expression did not differ as a function of treatment in the anterior VMH, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, or the amygdala. Hyperglycemia with and without hyperinsulinemia decreased BDNF mRNA levels in the pituitary. Plasma BDNF concentrations were not changed by any of the treatments. Our results suggest that hyperinsulinemia alone does not affect BDNF mRNA expression in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, or pituitary. Our study is the first to distinguish that within the hypothalamus, prolonged high glucose levels in non-fasted rats regulates BDNF gene expression in a brain nuclei-specific fashion.

AB  - Abstract
Background: An increasing number of neuroimaging studies have revealed gray matter (GM) anomalies of several brain regions by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies in migraineurs. However, not all the studies reported entirely consistent findings. Our aim is to investigate concurrence across VBM studies to help clarify the structural anomalies underpinning this condition. Methods: A systematic search of VBM studies of patients with migraine and healthy controls (HC) published in PubMed and Embase databases from January 2000 to March 2014 was conducted. A quantitative meta-analysis of whole-brain VBM studies in patients with migraine compared with HC was performed by means of anisotropic effect size version of signed differential mapping (AES-SDM) software package. Results: Nine studies comprising 222 patients with migraine and 230 HC subjects were included in the present study. Compared to HC subjects, the patients group showed consistent decreased GM in the posterior insular-opercular regions, the prefrontal cortex, and the anterior cingulate cortex. Results remained largely unchanged in the following jackknife sensitivity analyses. Meta-regression analysis showed that a higher percentage of females in the patient sample was associated with decreased GM in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Conclusions: This is the first quantitative whole-brain VBM meta-analysis in migraine showing strong evidence of brain GM anomalies within the pain-processing neural network. Further longitudinal investigations are needed to determine whether these structural anomalies are reversible with effective treatment on migraine.

AB  - Abstract
Increased understanding of the neurovascular niche suggests that development of the central nervous system (CNS) and its vasculature is coordinated through shared regulatory factors. These include the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family, reported to promote neuroproliferation and neuroprotection in addition to angiogenesis via its receptors VEGFR1–3. VEGFR3, a mediator of lymphangiogenesis, is expressed in murine and rat brain from early gestation, has been associated with neural progenitors and neurons (Choi et al., 2010) and oligodendroglia (Le Bras et al., 2006) in the developing cortex and is reported to mediate adult neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) (Calvo et al., 2011). The early expression pattern of VEGFR3 protein and its cellular associations has not as yet been comprehensively reported. We describe the temporal expression of VEGFR3 protein at a cellular level and its close association with its VEGFC ligand, determined by double-labeling immunohistochemistry in the developing rat brain from embryonic day (E) 13 to postnatal day (P) 23. We found high expression of VEGFR3 in the ventricular zone and along radial glia in early gestation in association with neural stem cells and neuroblasts. Similar expression patterns were seen in the immature olfactory bulb and optic cup. In later development we found less expression by neural progenitors in proliferative regions including the SVZ and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. In contrast, VEGFR3 expression increased with development in the cortex in neurons and astrocytes, and appeared in the emerging population of oligodendroglial progenitors. High expression in ventricular ependyma, choroid plexus and pigmented retinal epithelium was noted from E18. VEGFC ligand was found in association with VEGFR3 throughout development, with highest expression in embryonic stages. Our findings suggest an important role for VEGFC/VEGFR3 signaling in neuronal proliferation in early forebrain development, and ongoing functions with niche neurogenesis, glial and ependymal function in the maturing postnatal brain.

AB  - Abstract
Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an inherited neurodevelopmental disorder affecting nearly one in 5000 newborn males and is a leading genetic cause of autism spectrum disorder. In addition to developmental delays and intellectual impairment, FXS is characterized by seizures, attention deficit, and hypersensitivity to visual, tactile and auditory stimuli. The Fmr1 gene encodes Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is abundant in neurons, binds select mRNAs and functions as a negative regulator of mRNA translation. A deficiency in FMRP, as in FXS and Fmr1 knockout (KO) animals, results in neuronal dysmorphology and altered synaptic function. Additionally, there is evidence for disruption of GABAergic circuits in subjects lacking FMRP. Our previous studies demonstrated widespread expression of FMRP in human auditory brainstem neurons. Given this observation, we hypothesized that FMRP is highly expressed in rat auditory brainstem neurons and that the auditory hypersensitivity characteristic of FXS results from dysfunction of brainstem networks secondary to decreased expression of FMRP. In our investigation of postnatal day 50 (P50) control rats, we found that FMRP was widely expressed in neurons of the superior olivary complex (SOC). In P50 Fmr1 KO rats, many SOC neurons had a smaller soma when compared to controls, indicative of abnormal neuronal morphology. Additionally, neurons in the medial superior olive (MSO) were more round in Fmr1 KO rats. There was also reduced expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) in neurons of the superior paraolivary nucleus (SPON) and a reduction in the number of calretinin-immunoreactive terminals associated with neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Together, these findings support the conclusion that the auditory dysfunction characteristic of FXS arises, at least in part, from defective brainstem networks.

AB  - Abstract
Damage to the cholinergic input to the prefrontal cortex has been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. Cholinergic endings release acetylcholine, which activates nicotinic and/or G-protein-coupled muscarinic receptors. Muscarinic receptors activate transduction systems, which control cellular effectors that regulate the membrane potential in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neurons. The mechanisms responsible for the cholinergic-dependent depolarization of mPFC layer V pyramidal neurons in slices obtained from young rats were elucidated in this study. Glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission as well as tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive Na+ and voltage-dependent Ca++ currents were eliminated. Cholinergic receptor stimulation by carbamoylcholine chloride (CCh; 100 μM) evoked depolarization (10.0 ± 1.3 mV), which was blocked by M1/M4 (pirenzepine dihydrochloride, 2 μM) and M1 (VU 0255035, 5 μM) muscarinic receptor antagonists and was not affected by a nicotinic receptor antagonist (mecamylamine hydrochloride, 10 μM). CCh-dependent depolarization was attenuated by extra- (20 μM) or intracellular (50 μM) application of an inhibitor of the βγ-subunit-dependent transduction system (gallein). It was also inhibited by intracellular application of a βγ-subunit-binding peptide (GRK2i, 10 μM). mPFC pyramidal neurons express Nav1.9 channels. CCh-dependent depolarization was abolished in the presence of antibodies against Nav1.9 channels in the intracellular solution and augmented by the presence of ProTx-I toxin (100 nM) in the extracellular solution. CCh-induced depolarization was not affected by the following reagents: intracellular transduction system blockers, including U-73122 (10 μM), chelerythrine chloride (5 μM), SQ 22536 (100 μM) and H-89 (2 μM); channel blockers, including Ba++ ions (200 μM), apamin (100 nM), flufenamic acid (200 μM), 2-APB (200 μM), SKF 96365 (50 μM), and ZD 7288 (50 μM); and a Na+/Ca++ exchanger blocker, benzamil (20 μM). We conclude that muscarinic M1 receptor-dependent depolarization in mPFC pyramidal neurons is evoked by the activation of Nav1.9 channels and that the signal transduction pathway involves G-protein βγ subunits.

Wobbler mutant mice suffer from progressive motoneuron degeneration and glial cell reactivity in the spinal cord. To prevent development of these abnormalities, we employed Nestorone, a high-affinity progesterone receptor agonist endowed with neuroprotective, promyelinating and anti-inflammatory activities in experimental brain ischemia, preventing neuroinflammation and chemical degeneration. Five-month-old Wobbler mice (wr−/wr−) received s.c. injections of 200 μg/day/mouse of Nestorone in vegetable oil or vehicle for 10 days. Control NFR/NFR mice (background strain for Wobbler) received vehicle only. Vehicle-treated Wobblers showed typical spinal cord abnormalities, such as vacuolated motoneurons, decreased immunoreactive choline-acetyltransferase, decreased expression of glutamine synthase (GS), increased glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive (GFAP) astrogliosis and curved digits in forelimbs. These cell-specific abnormalities were normalized in Nestorone-treated Wobblers. In addition, vehicle-treated Wobblers showed Iba1+ microgliosis, high expression of the microglial marker CD11b mRNA and up-regulation of the proinflammatory markers TNFα and iNOS mRNAs. In Nestorone-treated Wobblers, Iba1+ microgliosis subsided, whereas CD11b, TNFα and iNOS mRNAs were down-regulated. NFκB mRNA was increased in Wobbler spinal cord and decreased by Nestorone, whereas expression of its inhibitor IκBα was increased in Nestorone-treated Wobblers compared to control mice and vehicle-treated Wobblers. In conclusion, our results showed that Nestorone restraining effects on proinflammatory mediators, microgliosis and astrogliosis may support neurons in their resistance against degenerative processes.

AB  - Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by difficulties with communication and social interactions, restricted, repetitive behaviors and sensory abnormalities. Additionally, the vast majority of subjects with ASD suffer some degree of auditory dysfunction and we have previously identified significant hypoplasia and dysmorphology in auditory brainstem centers in individuals with ASD. Prenatal exposure to the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA) is associated with an increased risk of ASD. In rodents, prenatal exposure to VPA is utilized as an animal model of ASD and is associated with a number of anatomical, physiological and behavioral deficits, including hypoplasia and dysmorphology in the auditory brainstem. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that such dysmorphology in VPA-exposed animals would translate into abnormal activity in brainstem circuits and irregular tonotopic maps. Herein, we have subjected control and VPA-exposed animals to 4 or 16 kHz tones and examined neuronal activation with immunohistochemistry for c-Fos. After these sound exposures, we found significantly more c-Fos-positive neurons in the auditory brainstem of VPA-exposed animals. Further, we found a larger dispersion of c-Fos-positive neurons and shifted tonotopic bands in VPA-exposed rats. We interpret these findings to suggest hyper-responsiveness to sounds and disrupted mapping of sound frequencies after prenatal VPA exposure. Based on these findings, we suggest that such abnormal patterns of activation may play a role in auditory processing deficits in ASD.

AB  - Abstract
Objectives: We hypothesized that the impact of distinct anesthetic regimens could be differently expressed during anesthesia and on post-anesthesia sleep in the neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, we followed the impact of ketamine/diazepam and pentobarbital anesthesia in a rat model of the severe Parkinson’s disease cholinergic neuropathology on the electroencephalographic (EEG) microstructure and respiratory pattern during anesthesia, and on the post-anesthesia sleep. Methods: We performed the experiments on adult, male, spontaneously breathing Wistar rats chronically instrumented for sleep recording. The bilateral pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT) lesion was done by ibotenic acid microinfusion. Following postoperative recovery, we recorded sleep for 6 h, induced anesthesia 24 h later using ketamine/diazepam or pentobarbital, and repeated sleep recordings sessions 48 h and 6 days later. During 20 min of each anesthesia we recorded both the EEG and respiratory movements. For sleep and EEG analysis, Fourier analysis was applied on 6-h recordings, and each 10-s epoch was differentiated as a state of wakefulness (Wake), non-rapid eye movement (NREM) or rapid eye movement (REM). Additionally, the group probability density distributions of all EEG frequency band relative amplitudes were calculated for each state, with particular attention during anesthesia. For respiratory pattern analysis we used Monotone Signal Segments Analysis. The PPT lesion was identified through nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) diaphorase histochemistry. Results and conclusions: Our data show that the ketamine/diazepam anesthetic regimen in the PPT-lesioned rats induces more alterations in the EEG microstructure and respiratory pattern than does the pentobarbital anesthesia. In addition, the equal time required to establish an anesthetized state, and the long-term effect on post-anesthesia sleep in the PPT-lesioned vs. control rats suggest this anesthetic regimen as potentially more beneficial both for anesthesia induction and for post-anesthesia sleep in the surgical procedures of the elderly, and Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s patients.

AB  - Abstract
Previous studies have shown that glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) exerts significant neuroprotective effects on substantia nigra (SN) neurons in the rat 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model of Parkinson’s disease (PD). In this study we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to determine GDNF brain levels and distribution to target regions (i.e. striatum and SN) following intranasal administration of GDNF at different time points after administration. Brain levels increased significantly within 1 h following a single 50-μg dose of GDNF in a liposomal formulation, returning to baseline by 24 h. In a second study, different doses of GDNF (10–150 μg) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were studied at the 1-h time point. Dose-dependent increases in brain GDNF levels were observed with apparent saturation of uptake at doses above 100 μg. Liposomes delivered 10-fold more GDNF to brain than PBS despite yielding similar neuroprotective efficacy in the 6-OHDA model, suggesting incomplete release of GDNF from liposomes in tissue. In a third study, autoradiography was performed on brain sections taken 1 h after intranasal 125I-labeled GDNF. Radioactivity was detected throughout the brain along the rostral-to-caudal axis, indicating that nasally administered GDNF can reach target areas. Collectively, these results demonstrate that intranasal administration of GDNF in liposomes or PBS achieves significant increases in GDNF in target brain areas, supporting use of intranasal administration as a non-invasive means of delivering GDNF to the brain to protect dopamine neurons and arrest disease progression in PD.

AB  - Abstract
Physical activity and non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) are crucial factors accounting for individual differences in body weight, interacting with genetic predisposition. In the brain, a number of neuroendocrine intermediates regulate food intake and energy expenditure (EE); this includes the brain melanocortin (MC) system, consisting of MC peptides as well as their receptors (MCR). MC3R and MC4R have emerged as critical modulators of EE and food intake. To determine how variance in MC signaling may underlie individual differences in physical activity levels, we examined behavioral response to MC receptor agonists and antagonists in rats that show high and low levels of physical activity and NEAT, that is, high- and low-capacity runners (HCR, LCR), developed by artificial selection for differential intrinsic aerobic running capacity. Focusing on the hypothalamus, we identified brain region-specific elevations in expression of MCR 3, 4, and also MC5R, in the highly active, lean HCR relative to the less active and obesity-prone LCR. Further, the differences in activity and associated EE as a result of MCR activation or suppression using specific agonists and antagonists were similarly region-specific and directly corresponded to the differential MCR expression patterns. The agonists and antagonists investigated here did not significantly impact food intake at the doses used, suggesting that the differential pattern of receptor expression may by more meaningful to physical activity than to other aspects of energy balance regulation. Thus, MCR-mediated physical activity may be a key neural mechanism in distinguishing the lean phenotype and a target for enhancing physical activity and NEAT.

AB  - Abstract
Microglia are the prime cellular sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the central nervous system (CNS). Chronic activation of microglia has been linked to aging-associated neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) since they produce excessive amounts of ROS for a prolonged duration leading to oxidative stress. The present study was aimed at investigating the expression and role of Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3), a protein deacetylase which is implicated in regulating cellular ROS levels. It has been shown that Sirt3 reduces cellular ROS levels by deacetylating forkhead box O 3a (Foxo3a), a transcription factor which transactivates antioxidant genes, catalase (Cat) and manganese superoxide dismutase (mnSod).

In the present study, Sirt3 immunoreactivity was localized in the ameboid microglial cells distributed in the corpus callosum (CC) of the early postnatal rat brain and diminished in the ramified microglial cells in the CC of the adult rat brain. A marked induction of Sirt3 expression was seen in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated microglia in vivo and in vitro as well as in adult rat brains subjected to traumatic brain injury (TBI). Knockdown of Sirt3 in microglia led to an increase in the cellular and mitochondrial ROS and decrease in the expression of antioxidant, mnSod which is indicative of the function of Sirt3 in ROS regulation in microglia. Conversely, Sirt3 overexpression led to increase in the expression of antioxidants Cat and mnSod. Further, increase in the expression and nuclear translocation of Foxo3a was observed following Sirt3 overexpression, suggesting that Sirt3 regulates ROS by inducing the expression of antioxidants via activation of Foxo3a. The above results point to an antioxidant defense mechanism presented by Sirt3 through the activation of Foxo3a, in microglia.

AB  - Abstract
Cholesterol metabolism is important for neuronal function in the central nervous system (CNS). The oxysterol 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) is a cholesterol metabolite that crosses the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and may be a useful substitutive marker for neurodegenerative diseases. However, the effects of 27-OHC on learning and memory and the underlying mechanisms are unclear. To determine this mechanism, we investigated learning and memory and cholesterol metabolism in rat brain following the injection of various doses of 27-OHC into the caudal vein. We found that 27-OHC increased cholesterol levels and upregulated the expression of liver X receptor-α (LXR-α) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter protein family member A1 (ABCA1). In addition, 27-OHC decreased the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CR) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in rat brain tissues. These findings suggest that 27-OHC may negatively modulate cognitive effects and cholesterol metabolism in the brain.

AB  - Abstract
The use of recreational marijuana is widespread and frequently begins and persists through adolescence. Some research has shown negative consequences of adolescent marijuana use, but this is not seen across studies, and certain factors, like genetic background and sex, may influence the results. It is critical to identify which characteristics predispose an individual to be susceptible to the negative consequences of chronic exposure to marijuana in adolescence on brain health and behavior. To this end, using males and females of two strains of rats, Long–Evans hooded (LER) and Wistar (WR) rats, we explored whether these anatomically and behaviorally dimorphic strains demonstrated differences in puberty onset and strain-specific effects of adolescent exposure to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component of marijuana. Daily 5 mg/kg treatment began on the day of puberty onset and continued for 14 days. Of particular interest were metrics of growth and volumetric estimates of brain areas involved in cognition that contain high densities of cannabinoid receptors, including the hippocampus and its subregions, the amygdala, and the frontal cortex. Brain volumetrics were analyzed immediately following the treatment period. LER and WR females started puberty at different ages, but no strain differences were observed in brain volumes. THC decreased weight gain throughout the treatment period for all groups. Only the hippocampus and some of its subregions were affected by THC, and increased volumes with THC administration was observed exclusively in females, regardless of strain. Long-term treatment of THC did not affect all individuals equally, and females displayed evidence of increased sensitivity to the effects of THC, and by extension, marijuana. Identifying differences in adolescent physiology of WR and LER rats could help determine the cause for strain and sex differences in brain and behavior of adults and help to refine the use of animal models in marijuana research.

AB  - Abstract
Recent studies have suggested that both configural information, such as face shape, and surface information is important for face perception. In particular, facial color is sufficiently suggestive of emotional states, as in the phrases: “flushed with anger” and “pale with fear.” However, few studies have examined the relationship between facial color and emotional expression. On the other hand, event-related potential (ERP) studies have shown that emotional expressions, such as fear, are processed unconsciously. In this study, we examined how facial color modulated the supraliminal and subliminal processing of fearful faces. We recorded electroencephalograms while participants performed a facial emotion identification task involving masked target faces exhibiting facial expressions (fearful or neutral) and colors (natural or bluish). The results indicated that there was a significant interaction between facial expression and color for the latency of the N170 component. Subsequent analyses revealed that the bluish-colored faces increased the latency effect of facial expressions compared to the natural-colored faces, indicating that the bluish color modulated the processing of fearful expressions. We conclude that the unconscious processing of fearful faces is affected by facial color.

AB  - Abstract
Tibia fracture in rodents induces substance P (SP)-dependent keratinocyte activation and inflammatory changes in the hindlimb, similar to those seen in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). In animal pain models spinal glial cell activation results in nociceptive sensitization. This study tested the hypothesis that limb fracture triggers afferent C-fiber SP release in the dorsal horn, resulting in chronic glial activation and central sensitization. At 4 weeks after tibia fracture and casting in rats, the cast was removed and hind paw allodynia, unweighting, warmth, and edema were measured, then the antinociceptive effects of microglia (minocycline) or astrocyte (L-2-aminoadipic acid (LAA)) inhibitors or an SP receptor antagonist (LY303870) were tested. Immunohistochemistry and PCR were used to evaluate microglial and astrocyte activation in the dorsal horn. Similar experiments were performed in intact rats after brief sciatic nerve electric stimulation at C-fiber intensity. Microglia and astrocytes were chronically activated at 4 weeks after fracture and contributed to the maintenance of hind paw allodynia and unweighting. Furthermore, LY303870 treatment initiated at 4 weeks after fracture partially reversed both spinal glial activation and nociceptive sensitization. Similarly, persistent spinal microglial activation and hind paw nociceptive sensitization were observed at 48 h after sciatic nerve C-fiber stimulation and this effect was inhibited by treatment with minocycline, LAA, or LY303870. These data support the hypothesis that C-fiber afferent SP signaling chronically supports spinal neuroglial activation after limb fracture and that glial activation contributes to the maintenance of central nociceptive sensitization in CRPS. Treatments inhibiting glial activation and spinal inflammation may be therapeutic for CRPS.

AB  - Abstract
Local field potentials (LFPs) reflect the coordinated firing of functional neural assemblies during information coding and transfer across neural networks. As such, it was proposed that the extraordinary variety of cytoarchitectonic elements in the brain is responsible for the wide range of amplitudes and for the coverage of field potentials, which in most cases receive contributions from multiple pathways and populations. The influence of spatial factors overrides the bold interpretations of customary measurements, such as the amplitude and polarity, to the point that their cellular interpretation is one of the hardest tasks in Neurophysiology. Temporal patterns and frequency bands are not exclusive to pathways but rather, the spatial configuration of the voltage gradients created by each pathway is highly specific and may be used advantageously. Recent technical and analytical advances now make it possible to separate and then reconstruct activity for specific pathways. In this review, we discuss how spatial features specific to cells and populations define the amplitude and extension of LFPs, why they become virtually indecipherable when several pathways are co-activated, and then we present the recent advances regarding their disentanglement using spatial discrimination techniques. The pathway-specific threads of LFPs have a simple cellular interpretation, and the temporal fluctuations obtained can be applied to a variety of new experimental objectives and improve existing approaches. Among others, they facilitate the parallel readout of activity in several populations over multiple time scales correlating them with behavior. Also, they access information contained in irregular fluctuations, facilitating the testing of ongoing plasticity. In addition, they open the way to unravel the synaptic nature of rhythmic oscillations, as well as the dynamic relationships between multiple oscillatory activities. The challenge of understanding which waves belong to which populations, and the pathways that provoke them, may soon be overcome.

AB  - Abstract
The effect of motor imagery (MI) practice on isometric force development is well-documented. However, whether practicing MI during rest periods of physical training improves the forthcoming performance remains unexplored. We involved 18 athletes in a counterbalanced design including three physical training sessions scheduled over five consecutive days. Training involved 10 maximal isometric contractions against a force plate, with the elbow at 90°. During two sessions, we integrated MI practice (focusing on either muscle activation or relaxation) during the inter-trial rest periods. We measured muscle performance from force plate and electromyograms of the biceps brachii and anterior deltoideus. We continuously monitored electrodermal activity (EDA) to control sympathetic nervous system activity. MI of muscle activation resulted in higher isometric force as compared to both MI of muscle relaxation and passive recovery (respectively +2.1% and +3.5%). MI practice of muscle relaxation also outperformed the control condition (+1.9%). Increased activation of the biceps brachii was recorded under both MI practice conditions compared to control. Biceps brachii activation was similar between the two MI practice conditions, but electromyography revealed a marginal trend toward greater activation of the anterior deltoideus during MI practice of muscle activation. EDA and self-reports indicated that these effects were independent from physiological arousal and motivation. These results might account for priming effects of MI practice yielding to higher muscle activation and force performance. Present findings may be of interest for applications in sports training and neurologic rehabilitation.

AB  - Abstract
Schedule-induced polydipsia (SIP) is an adjunctive behavior in which rats exhibit excessive drinking as a consequence of intermittent feeding, and it has been proposed as a candidate model to study the development of compulsive and repetitive behavior. Although several brain structures are involved in compulsive behavior, it has been suggested that alterations in fronto-striatal circuits may underlie compulsive spectrum disorders. In the present work, we examined whether SIP would induce modifications in dorsolateral striatum (DLS) and anterior prefrontal cortex (aPFC) neurons. Specifically, the effects of 20 sessions of SIP were determined in the dendrites of DLS medium spiny neurons and in the basal dendritic arbors of layer V pyramidal cells in the aPFC. The structure, size and branching complexity in aPFC neurons were also studied. Results showed that SIP resulted in an increase in dendritic spine density in DLS neurons. Moreover, dendritic spine density was highly correlated with the level of drinking in animals subjected to SIP. By contrast, we observed no differences either in dendritic spine density or in the morphological structure of the dendrites of the aPFC in SIP rats compared to their control counterparts. We hypothesize that SIP-induced structural plasticity in DLS neurons could be related to inflexible response in compulsive behavior. The findings of this study could provide new insights into the involvement of particular cell populations of the dorsolateral striatum and anterior prefrontal cortex regions in compulsive spectrum disorders.

AB  - Abstract
2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) has been recently identified as a common agonist of TWIK-related K+ channel (TREK)/TRAAK channels, a subfamily of two-pore domain K+ (K2P) channels. TREK-2 displays much higher sensitivity to 2-APB compared with TREK-1, despite that these two channels share the highest homology among K2P members. However, the structural basis for their difference in response to 2-APB still remains unknown. Here we identified that the cytosolic C-terminus (Ct) domain plays a dominant role in controlling the stimulatory effects of 2-APB on TREK-2 channel. The distal Ct region negatively regulates the effect of 2-APB, while the proximal Ct is sufficient to evoke the full 2-APB activation of the channel. Further mapping within the proximal Ct revealed that His368 is required for 2-APB activation, and the cooperation of the other non-conserved residues is also necessary. We also identified a secondary active site for 2-APB, which is located at the bottom of the transmembrane segment M2. Finally, we demonstrated that key residues or domains required for 2-APB activation are not involved in the gating mechanism of the selectivity filter. In summary, we reveal a unique modulatory model of TREK-2-Ct that distinguishes it from TREK-1 in high sensitivity to 2-APB. The cooperation of the non-conserved residues within the proximal Ct of TREK-2 plays a dominant role in the 2-APB-induced channel opening, whereas the distal Ct negatively regulates the process.

AB  - Abstract
Sickness behaviors have become the focus of great interest in recent years as they represent a clear case of how peripheral disturbances in immune signaling can disrupt quite complex behaviors. In the current study, we were interested in examining whether we could identify any significant morphological disturbances in microglia associated with these sickness-like behaviors in adult male Sprague–Dawley rats. We chose lipopolysaccharide (LPS 100 μg/kg/i.p.), to induce sickness-like behaviors as it is the most well-validated approach to do so in rodents and humans. We were particularly interested in examining changes in microglia within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as several recent neuroimaging studies have highlighted significant functional changes in this region following peripheral LPS administration. Paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue was collected from animals 24 h post LPS administration and labeled immunohistochemically with an antibody directed to bind to Iba-1, a protein known to be involved in the structural remodeling of microglia. To analyze changes, we have made use of two recently described image analysis procedures. The first is known as cumulative threshold spectra (CTS) analysis. The second involves the unsupervised digital reconstruction of microglia. We undertook these complementary analysis of microglial cells in the both the pre- and infralimbic divisions of the PFC. Our results indicated that microglial soma size was significantly enlarged, while cell processes had contracted slightly following LPS administration. To our knowledge this study is to first to definitely demonstrate substantial microglial disturbances within the PFC following LPS delivered at a dose that was sufficient to induce significant sickness-like behavior.

AB  - Abstract
Acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) is a neurotrophic factor which is a powerful neuroprotective and neuroregenerative factor of the nervous system. Prior study had shown that levels of FGFs significantly increase following ischemic injury, reflecting a physiological protection mechanism. However, few reports demonstrated the efficacy of applying aFGF in cerebral ischemia. A recent report showed that the intranasal aFGF treatment improved neurological functional recovery; however, it did not significantly reduce the lesion size in ischemic rats. The present study examines the neuroprotective effect of aFGF on cortical neuron-glial cultures under oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced cell damage and investigates whether epidural application of slow-released aFGF could improve benefit on ischemic stroke injury in conscious rats. We used a topical application of aFGF mixed in fibrin glue, a slow-release carrier, over the peri-ischemic cortex and examined such treatment on cerebral infarction and behavioral impairments of rats subjected to focal cerebral ischemia (FCI). Results demonstrate that aFGF effectively protected cortical neuron-glial cultures from OGD-induced neuronal damage. Neurite extension from cortical neurons was significantly enhanced by aFGF, mediated through activation of AKT and ERK. In addition, topical application of fibrin glue-mixed aFGF dose-dependently reduced ischemia-induced brain infarction and improved functional restoration in ischemic stroke rats. Slow-released aFGF not only protected hippocampal and cortical cell loss but reduced microglial infiltration in FCI rats. Our results suggest that aFGF mixed in fibrin glue could prolong the protective/regenerative efficacy of aFGF to the damaged brain tissue and thus improve the functional restorative effect of aFGF.

AB  - Abstract
The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a complex structure that protects the central nervous system from peripheral insults. Understanding the molecular basis of BBB function and dysfunction holds significant potential for future strategies to prevent and treat neurological damage. The aim of our study was (1) to investigate BBB alterations following excitotoxicity and (2) to test the protective properties of melatonin.

Ibotenate, a glutamate analog, was injected intracerebrally in postnatal day 5 (P5) rat pups to mimic excitotoxic injury. Animals were than randomly divided into two groups, one receiving intraperitoneal (i.p.) melatonin injections (5 mg/kg), and the other phosphate buffer saline (PBS) injections. Pups were sacrificed 2, 4 and 18 h after ibotenate injection. We determined lesion size at 5 days by histology, the location and organization of tight junction (TJ) proteins by immunohistochemical studies, and BBB leakage by dextran extravasation. Expression levels of BBB genes (TJs, efflux transporters and detoxification enzymes) were determined in the cortex and choroid plexus by quantitative PCR.

Dextran extravasation was seen 2 h after the insult, suggesting a rapid BBB breakdown that was resolved by 4 h. Extravasation was significantly reduced in melatonin-treated pups. Gene expression and immunohistochemical assays showed dynamic BBB modifications during the first 4 h, partially prevented by melatonin. Lesion-size measurements confirmed white matter neuroprotection by melatonin.

Our study is the first to evaluate BBB structure and function at a very early time point following excitotoxicity in neonates. Melatonin neuroprotects by preventing TJ modifications and BBB disruption at this early phase, before its previously demonstrated anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and axonal regrowth-promoting effects.

AB  - Abstract
High-voltage-activated (HVA) calcium channels play an important role in synaptic transmission. Activation of Mas-related G-protein-coupled receptor subtype C (MrgC; mouse MrgC11, rat homolog rMrgC) inhibits HVA calcium current (ICa) in small-diameter dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, but the intracellular signaling cascade underlying MrgC agonist-induced inhibition of HVA ICa in native DRG neurons remains unclear. To address this question, we conducted patch-clamp recordings in MrgA3-eGFP-wild-type mice, in which most MrgA3-eGFP+ DRG neurons co-express MrgC11 and can be identified for recording. We found that the inhibition of HVA ICa by JHU58 (0.001–100 nM, a dipeptide, MrgC-selective agonist) was significantly reduced by pretreatment with a phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor (U73122, 1 μM), but not by its inactive analog (U73343) or vehicle. Further, in rats that had undergone spinal nerve injury, pretreatment with intrathecal U73122 nearly abolished the inhibition of mechanical hypersensitivity by intrathecal JHU58. The inhibition of HVA ICa in MrgA3-eGFP+ neurons by JHU58 (100 nM) was partially reduced by pretreatment with a Gβγ blocker (gallein, 100 μM). However, applying a depolarizing prepulse and blocking the Gαi and Gαs pathways with pertussis toxin (PTX) (0.5 μg/mL) and cholera toxin (CTX) (0.5 μg/mL), respectively, had no effect. These findings suggest that activation of MrgC11 may inhibit HVA ICa in mouse DRG neurons through a voltage-independent mechanism that involves activation of the PLC, but not Gαi or Gαs, pathway.

AB  - Abstract
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent psychiatric mood illness and a major cause of disability and suicide worldwide. However, the underlying pathophysiology of MDD remains poorly understood due to its heterogenic nature. Extensive pre-clinical research suggests that many molecular alterations associated with MDD preferentially localize to the postsynaptic density (PSD). Here, we used a rodent chronic mild stress (CMS) model to generate susceptible and unsusceptible subpopulations. Proteomic analysis using an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and tandem mass spectrometry was performed to identify differentially expressed proteins in enriched PSD preparations from the hippocampi of different groups. More than 1500 proteins were identified and quantified, and 74 membrane proteins were differentially expressed. Of these membrane proteins, 51 (69%) were identified by SynaptomeDB search as having a predicted PSD localization. The unbiased profiles identified several PSD candidate proteins that may be related to CMS vulnerability or insusceptibility, and these two CMS phenotypes displayed differences in the abundance of several types of proteins. A detailed protein functional analysis pointed to a role for PSD-associated proteins involved in signaling and regulatory functions. Within the PSD, the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit NR2A and its downstream targets contribute to CMS susceptibility. Further analysis of disease relevance indicated that the PSD contains a complex set of proteins of known relevance to mental illnesses including depression. In sum, these findings provide novel insights into the contribution of PSD-associated proteins to stress susceptibility and further advance our understanding of the role of hippocampal synaptic plasticity in MDD.

AB  - Abstract
The present study aimed to examine the effects of chronic social defeat stress on the dopamine receptors and proteins involved in post-endocytic trafficking pathways. Adult mice were divided into susceptible and unsusceptible groups after 10 days of social defeat stress. Western blot analysis was used to measure the protein expression levels of dopamine D2 receptors (D2Rs), a short (D2S) and a long form (D2L) and, D2R monomers and dimers, dopamine D1 receptors (D1Rs), neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) and G protein-coupled receptor-associated sorting protein-1 (GASP-1), and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to measure the mRNA expression levels of D2S, D2L, D2R monomers and dimers, and D1Rs in different brain areas. We observed increased expression of D2S, D2L and D2Rs dimers in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of susceptible and/or unsusceptible mice compared with controls. The only significant findings with regard to mRNA expression levels were lower expression of D2S mRNA in the amygdala (AMYG) of susceptible and unsusceptible mice compared with controls. The present study demonstrated that chronic social defeat stress induced increased expression of D2S, D2L, and D2R dimers in the PFC of susceptible and/or unsusceptible mice.

AB  - Abstract
Vitamin D is a neuroactive steroid. Its genomic actions are mediated via the active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3, binding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR). The VDR emerges in the rat mesencephalon at embryonic day 12, representing the peak period of dopaminergic cell birth. Our prior studies reveal that developmental vitamin D (DVD)-deficiency alters the ontogeny of dopaminergic neurons in the developing mesencephalon. There is also consistent evidence from others that 1,25(OH)2D3 promotes the survival of dopaminergic neurons in models of dopaminergic toxicity. In both developmental and toxicological studies it has been proposed that 1,25(OH)2D3 may modulate the differentiation and maturation of dopaminergic neurons; however, to date there is lack of direct evidence. The aim of the current study is to investigate this both in vitro using a human SH-SY5Y cell line transfected with rodent VDR and in vivo using a DVD-deficient model. Here we show that in VDR-expressing SH-SY5Y cells, 1,25(OH)2D3 significantly increased production of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis. This effect was dose- and time-dependent, but was not due to an increase in TH-positive cell number, nor was it due to the production of trophic survival factors for dopamine neurons such as glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). In accordance with 1,25(OH)2D3’s anti-proliferative actions in the brain, 1,25(OH)2D3 reduced the percentage of dividing cells from approximately 15–10%. Given the recently reported role of N-cadherin in the direct differentiation of dopaminergic neurons, we examined here whether it may be elevated by 1,25(OH)2D3. We confirmed this in vitro and more importantly, we showed DVD-deficiency decreases N-cadherin expression in the embryonic mesencephalon. In summary, in our in vitro model we have shown 1,25(OH)2D3 increases TH expression, decreases proliferation and elevates N-cadherin, a potential factor that mediates these processes. Accordingly all of these findings are reversed in the developing brain in our DVD-deficiency model. Remarkably our findings in the DVD-deficiency model phenocopy those found in a recent model where N-cadherin was regionally ablated from the mesencephalon. This study has, for the first time, shown that vitamin D directly modulates TH expression and strongly suggests N-cadherin may be a plausible mediator of this process both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings may help to explain epidemiological data linking DVD deficiency with schizophrenia.

AB  - Abstract
A growing bulk of evidence suggests that cannabinoid system plays a pivotal role in the control of hyperexcitability phenomena. Notwithstanding, the anticonvulsant action of cannabinoids has not been fully addressed, in particular the involvement of potential cellular neuromodulators, for instance nitric oxide. In the current study, we focused on two distinct rat models of temporal lobe epilepsy, the Maximal Dentate Activation and the pilocarpine-induced acute seizures, providing both electrophysiological and behavioral data on cannabinoid and nitrergic system interplay. We evaluated the antiepileptic effects of WIN 55,212-2, (R)-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-(4-morpholinylmethyl) pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-Yl]-1-naphthalenylmethanone (WIN), a CB agonist, and of 7-Nitroindazole (7NI), a preferential neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) inhibitor, at different doses, alone and in combination. MDA study showed that these drugs protected animals in a dose-dependent manner from electrically induced epileptiform discharges. In pilocarpine model, a dose-related activity of 7NI and WIN: a) decreased the behavioral scoring, used to describe the severity of chemically induced acute seizures; b) affected latency of the onset of acute convulsions; c) dampened mortality rate. Interestingly, the combination of the treatments brought to light that individually ineffective doses of WIN turn into effective when nNOS activity is pharmacologically inhibited in both experimental conditions. This effect is mediated by CB1 receptor since the co-administration of N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (AM251), a CB1 receptor specific antagonist, thwarted the 7NI–WIN convergent action. In the light of this, our findings suggest a putative antagonism between CBr-activated pathway and NO signaling in the context of neuronal hyperexcitability and contribute to elucidate possible synaptic processes underlying neuroprotective properties of cannabinoids, with a view to better integrate antiepileptic therapy.

AB  - Abstract
The field of autoimmune encephalitides associated with antibodies targeting cell-surface antigens is rapidly expanding and new antibodies are discovered frequently. Typical clinical presentations include cognitive deficits, psychiatric symptoms, movement disorders and seizures and the majority of patients respond well to immunotherapy. Pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical features are increasingly recognized and indicate hippocampal dysfunction in most of these syndromes. Here, we review the neuroimaging characteristics of autoimmune encephalitides, including N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1), contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2) encephalitis as well as more recently discovered and less frequent forms such as dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein 6 (DPPX) or glycine receptor encephalitis. We summarize findings of routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) investigations as well as 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG)–positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission tomography (SPECT) imaging and relate these observations to clinical features and disease outcome. We furthermore review results of advanced imaging analyses such as diffusion tensor imaging, volumetric analyses and resting-state functional MRI. Finally, we discuss contributions of these neuroimaging observations to the understanding of the pathophysiology of autoimmune encephalitides.

AB  - Abstract
Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1 and mGluR5) are functionally linked to estrogen receptors and play a key role in the plasticity of central neurons. Estrogen status strongly influences sensory input from the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) to neurons at the spinomedullary (Vc/C1–2) region. This study tested the hypothesis that TMJ input to trigeminal subnucleus caudalis/upper cervical cord (Vc/C1–2) neurons involved group I mGluR activation and depended on estrogen status. TMJ-responsive neurons were recorded in superficial laminae at the Vc/C1–2 region in ovariectomized (OvX) female rats treated with low-dose estradiol (2 μg/day, LE) or high-dose estradiol (20 μg/day, HE) for 2 days. TMJ-responsive units were activated by adenosine triphosphate (ATP, 1 mM) injected into the joint space. Receptor antagonists selective for mGluR1 (CPCCOEt) or mGluR5 (MPEP) were applied topically to the Vc/C1–2 surface at the site of recording 10 min prior to the intra-TMJ ATP stimulus. In HE rats, CPCCOEt (50 and 500 μM) markedly reduced ATP-evoked unit activity. By contrast, in LE rats, a small but significant increase in neural activity was seen after 50 μM CPCCOEt, while 500 μM caused a large reduction in activity that was similar in magnitude as that seen in HE rats. Local application of MPEP produced a significant inhibition of TMJ-evoked unit activity independent of estrogen status. Neither mGluR1 nor mGluR5 antagonism altered the spontaneous activity of TMJ units in HE or LE rats. High-dose MPEP caused a small reduction in the size of the convergent cutaneous receptive field in HE rats, while CPCCOEt had no effect. These data suggest that group I mGluRs play a key role in sensory integration of TMJ nociceptive input to the Vc/C1–2 region and are largely independent of estrogen status.

AB  - Abstract
Background: It has been shown that chronic pain is able to induce depressive disorders in humans, in part, due to peripheral inflammation that reaches the central nervous system. However, the mechanisms involved remain to be established. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether sciatic nerve crush could produce depression-like behaviors, in addition to pain-related behaviors, in mice. Once confirmed, this model was used to investigate tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) as a key mediator involved in the pathophysiology of both pain and depression. Experimental approach: Male Swiss mice were divided into three groups, naïve, sham and operated. In the operated group, the sciatic nerve was crushed. Following surgery, animals from the operated group were treated daily by oral gavage (p.o.) with saline (10 ml/kg), fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) or thalidomide (10 mg/kg) for 15 days. Mechanical hyperalgesia was evaluated every 3 days by von Frey filaments and depressive-like behavior was assessed at the end of day 15, using the tail suspension test (TST) and the forced swimming test (FST). Then, samples from the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and sciatic nerve were processed to measure TNF-α levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: Crush caused significant mechanical hyperalgesia and depressive-like behaviors and increased TNF-α levels in the sciatic nerve, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of operated animals. Treatment with fluoxetine or thalidomide reversed crush-induced mechanical hyperalgesia, depressive-like behaviors and the increased TNF-α levels in the sciatic nerve, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Conclusions: The sciatic nerve crush model represents a good model to study to mechanisms underlying both pain and depressive-like behaviors. Furthermore, inhibitors of TNF-α synthesis, like thalidomide, have a potential to treat depressive disorders associated with neuropathic pain.

AB  - Abstract
Several studies reveal that the beneficial effects of exercise interventions are dependent on the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We have previously shown that long-term treadmill exercise begun before the onset of β-amyloid (Aβ) pathology prevents the deficits of cognition and long-term potentiation (LTP) in amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) transgenic mice (8 months of age) paralleled by the reduction of soluble Aβ levels and Aβ deposition in the hippocampus. In the present study, treadmill exercise was initiated at a developed Aβ deposition stage in order to further investigate whether or not treadmill exercise in this phase can delay the progression of AD in aged APP/PS1 mice (17 months of age). Our results show that 5-month treadmill exercise ameliorates the impairment of spatial learning and memory with age paralleled by synaptic plasticity enhancement in aged APP/PS1 mice. In addition, exercise-induced enhancement of synaptic plasticity was accompanied by a significant reduction of soluble Aβ levels rather than Aβ plaque deposition. Therefore, the investigation demonstrates that long-term treadmill exercise has beneficial effects on cognition and synaptic plasticity even when the brain has developed Aβ deposition, and changes in soluble Aβ levels rather than Aβ plaque deposition may contribute to exercise-induced benefits.

AB  - Abstract
Faces are important for social interaction because much can be perceived from facial details, including a person’s race, age, and mood. Recent studies have shown that both configural (e.g. face shape and inversion) and surface information (e.g. surface color and reflectance properties) are important for face perception. Therefore, the present study examined the effects of facial color and inverted face properties on event-related potential (ERP) responses, particularly the N170 component. Stimuli consisted of natural and bluish-colored faces. Faces were presented in both upright and upside down orientations. An ANOVA was used to analyze N170 amplitudes and verify the effects of the main independent variables. Analysis of N170 amplitude revealed the significant interactions between stimulus orientation and color. Subsequent analysis indicated that N170 was larger for bluish-colored faces than natural-colored faces, and N170 to natural-colored faces was larger in response to inverted stimulus as compared to upright stimulus. Additionally, a multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) investigated face-processing dynamics without any prior assumptions. Results distinguished, above chance, both facial color and orientation from single-trial electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Decoding performance for color classification of inverted faces was significantly diminished as compared to an upright orientation. This suggests that processing orientation is predominant over facial color. Taken together, the present findings elucidate the temporal and spatial distribution of orientation and color processing during face processing.

AB  - Abstract
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been shown to promote post-stroke angiogenesis and long-term functional recovery; however, whether IL-6 could promote post-stroke neurogenesis remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the effects of IL-6 on neurogenesis after ischemic stroke. We also investigated whether pair housing (PH) could improve the experimental stroke outcome through IL-6. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) was induced in mice treated with recombinant IL-6 (rIL-6) or anti-IL-6 neutralizing antibodies (anti-IL-6 mAbs). Another set of mice were pair-housed (PH; male and ovariectomized female) for 2 weeks, subjected to tMCAO and then assigned to a housing condition (isolated or PH). Pair-housed mice were treated with anti-IL-6 mAbs. Behavioral assessments were made 3 days before tMCAO and after 28 days of reperfusion. Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) isolated from ipsilateral subventricular zone (SVZ) at 14 days post-ischemia were treated with rIL-6 plus soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R). The effects of IL-6 on the proliferation and differentiation of NPCs were examined in vivo and in vitro. The role and mechanism of IL-6 in PH-mediated enhancement of NPC proliferation and functional recovery were investigated in vivo. We found that anti-IL-6 mAbs significantly reduced the proliferation and neuronal differentiation of NPCs in the ipsilateral SVZ, as well as functional recovery; whereas rIL-6 conferred the opposite effects. PH significantly promoted NPC proliferation and functional recovery compared with socially isolated cohorts; blockade of IL-6 with anti-IL-6 mAbs prevented this promoting effect. In conclusion, our results suggest that IL-6 is an important mediator of social interaction on neurogenesis and long-term functional recovery after ischemic stroke.

AB  - Abstract
The type 1 equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT1) is implicated in regulating levels of extracellular adenosine ([AD]ex). In the basal forebrain (BF) levels of [AD]ex increase during wakefulness and closely correspond to the increases in the electroencephalogram (EEG) delta (0.75–4.5 Hz) activity (NRδ) during subsequent non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS). Thus in the BF, [AD]ex serves as a biochemical marker of sleep homeostasis. Waking EEG activity in theta range (5–9 Hz, Wθ) is also described as a marker of sleep homeostasis. An hour-by-hour temporal relationship between the Wθ and NRδ is unclear. In this study we examined the relationship between these EEG markers of sleep homeostasis during spontaneous sleep–wakefulness and during sleep deprivation (SD) and recovery sleep in the ENT1 gene knockout (ENT1KO) mouse. We observed that baseline NREMS amount was decreased during the light period in ENT1KO mice, accompanied by a weak correlation between Wθ of each hour and NRδ of its subsequent hour when compared to their wild-type (WT) littermates. Perfusion of low dose of adenosine into BF not only strengthened the Wθ–NRδ relationship, but also increased NREMS to match with the WT littermates suggesting decreased [AD]ex in ENT1KO mice. However, the SD-induced [AD]ex increase in the BF and the linear correlation between the EEG markers of sleep homeostasis were unaffected in ENT1KO mice suggesting that during SD, sources other than ENT1 contribute to increase in [AD]ex. Our data provide evidence for a differential regulation of wakefulness-associated [AD]ex during spontaneous vs prolonged waking.

AB  - Abstract
Icariin is derived most commonly from the traditional Chinese herb Epimedium brevicornum Maxim. Our previous studies have shown that icariin protects neurons from neurotoxic and ischemic conditions. This study aims to investigate the effect of icariin on the expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the level of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), as well as neurogenesis in the brain of Tg2576 mice, an animal model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Tg2576 mice and wild-type littermates (WT) were randomized into the following three groups: Tg2576, Tg2576 + icariin, and WT groups. All 9-month-old mice were treated with icariin (60 mg/kg/d) or distilled water for 3 months. Following this, the spatial working memory of Tg2576 + icariin mice, as examined in the Y-maze task, was found to improve. Furthermore, reduced levels of insoluble Aβ1–40 (69%) and Aβ1–42 (50%) after icariin treatment were determined in the brain by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Western blot analysis indicated the downregulation of APP expression after icariin treatment, and double staining showed an increased number of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)/Neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) double-positive cells in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus in Tg2576 + icariin mice compared with the Tg2576 mice. The current study demonstrated that icariin improved memory function, decreased the levels of Aβ and APP in the brain, and enhanced neurogenesis in the hippocampus of Tg2576 mice. Collectively, these results suggest the potential therapeutic value of icariin in AD.

AB  - Abstract
Our previous studies demonstrated resveratrol (Res) administration protected Alzheimer’s disease (AD) rats from developing memory decline by anti-oxidation. Beta-amyloid peptide 1–42 (Aβ1–42) is not only the primary protein component of senile plaques in AD but also is believed to play an important part in its pathology. Increasing evidence has shown neuroinflammation and the integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is closely related to the pathogenesis of AD. The aim of the present study is to further elucidate whether Res prevents AD rats from inflammation induced by Aβ1–42 and protects the integrity of BBB. Rats were divided into six groups: (1) ovariectomized (OVX) + d-galactose (d-gal) 100 mg/kg group (OVX + d-gal); (2–4) OVX, d-gal and Res 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg treated groups; and (5) OVX, d-gal and estradiol valerate 0.8 mg/kg treated group (ET); (6) Sham control group. 12 weeks later, Res 40 and 80 mg/kg treatment exhibited a significant decrease of Aβ1–42 compared with the OVX + d-gal rats of hippocampus, which was accompanied by decreased expression of advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE), matrix metalloprotein-9 (MMP-9), nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) and the increase of Claudin-5. These results suggest that Res is useful not only in protecting OVX + d-gal rats from neuroinflammation mediated by Aβ1–42 by decreasing the expression of NF-κB but also the integrity of BBB by increasing Claudin-5 and decreasing RAGE, MMP-9.

AB  - Abstract
Sustained administration of cannabinoid agonists acting on neuronal CB1 receptors (CB1Rs) are proposed for treating spasticity and chronic pain. The impact of CB1Rs on mammalian locomotor networks remains, however, incompletely understood. To clarify how CB1Rs may control synaptic activity and locomotor network function, we used the rat spinal cord in vitro which is an advantageous model to investigate locomotor circuit mechanisms produced by the local central pattern generator. Neither the CB1 agonist anandamide (AEA) nor the CB1R antagonist AM-251 evoked early (&lt;3 h) changes in mono or polysynaptic reflexes or in locomotor rhythms. Application of AEA (24 h) significantly decreased the ability of dorsal root (DR) afferents to elicit oscillatory cycles, and left synaptic responses unchanged. Similar application of LY 2183240, or JZL 184, inhibitors of endocannabinoid uptake processes, produced analogous results. Application of the antagonist AM-251 (or rimonabant) for &gt;3–24 h largely impaired locomotor network activity induced by DR stimuli or neurochemicals, and depressed disinhibited bursting without changing reflex amplitude or inducing neurotoxicity even if CB1R immunoreactivity was lowered in the central region. Since CB1R activation usually inhibits cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) synthesis, we investigated how a 24-h application of AEA or AM-251 affected basal or forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels. While AEA decreased them in an AM-251-sensitive manner, AM-251 per se did not change resting or stimulated cAMP. Our data suggest that CB1Rs may control the circuit gateway regulating the inflow of sensory afferent inputs into the locomotor circuits, indicating a potential site of action for restricting peripheral signals disruptive for locomotor activity.

AB  - Abstract
Identifying novel neuroprotectants that can halt or even reverse the effects of stroke is of interest to both clinicians and scientists. Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) is an effective neuroprotectant, but its molecular mechanisms are largely unclear. In this study, NRG1 rescued cortical neurons from oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model, but the effect was blocked by neutralizing NRG1 and ErbB4 inhibition. In addition, γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonists had no synergistic effect with NRG1, and the neuroprotective effect of NRG1 against OGD was partly blocked by GABA receptor antagonists. Importantly, NRG1 neuroprotection against brain ischemia was abolished in the mice with specific deletion of ErbB4 in parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons. In summary, NRG1 protects against ischemic brain injury via ErbB4 receptors by enhancing GABAergic transmission.

AB  - Abstract
Cancer therapies can be associated with significant central nervous system (CNS) toxicity. While radiation-induced brain damage has been long recognized both in pediatric and adult cancer patients, CNS toxicity from chemotherapy has only recently been acknowledged. Clinical studies suggest that the most frequent neurotoxic adverse effects associated with chemotherapy include memory and learning deficits, alterations of attention, concentration, processing speed and executive function.

Preclinical studies have started to shed light on how chemotherapy targets the CNS both on cellular and molecular levels to disrupt neural function and brain plasticity. Potential mechanisms include direct cellular toxicity, alterations in cellular metabolism, oxidative stress, and induction of pro-inflammatory processes with subsequent disruption of normal cellular and neurological function. Damage to neural progenitor cell populations within germinal zones of the adult CNS has been identified as one of the key mechanisms by which chemotherapy might exert long-lasting and progressive neurotoxic effects.

Based on the important role of the hippocampus for maintenance of brain plasticity throughout life, several experimental studies have focused on the study of chemotherapy effects on hippocampal neurogenesis and associated learning and memory.

An increasing body of literature from both animal studies and neuroimaging studies in cancer patients suggests a possible relationship between chemotherapy induced hippocampal damage and the spectrum of neurocognitive deficits and mood alterations observed in cancer patients. This review aims to briefly summarize current preclinical and neuroimaging studies that are providing a potential link between the neurotoxic effects of chemotherapy and hippocampal dysfunction, highlighting challenges and future directions in this field of investigation.

AB  - Abstract
Canine degenerative myelopathy (DM) is an adult-onset progressive neurodegenerative disorder that has recently been linked to mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene. We generated a polyclonal antibody against canine SOD1 to further characterize the mutant SOD1 protein and its involvement in DM pathogenesis. This antibody (SYN3554) was highly specific to canine SOD1 and had the ability to reveal distinct cytoplasmic aggregates in cultured cells expressing canine mutant SOD1 and also in the spinal neurons of symptomatic homozygotes. A similar staining pattern was observed in asymptomatic homozygotes. SOD1 aggregates were not detected in the spinal neurons of heterozygotes; the accumulation of SOD1 was also detected in the reactive astrocytes of homozygotes and heterozygotes to a similar extent. Our results support the hypothesis that the cytoplasmic accumulation and aggregate formation of the mutant SOD1 protein, especially in astrocytes, are closely associated with the pathogenesis of DM. Therefore, this disease is regarded as a spontaneous large-animal model of SOD1-mediated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in humans.

AB  - Abstract
Rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) is regulated by the interaction of the REM-ON and REM-OFF neurons located in the pedunculo-pontine-tegmentum (PPT) and the locus coeruleus (LC), respectively. Many other brain areas, particularly those controlling non-REMS (NREMS) and waking, modulate REMS by modulating these REMS-related neurons. Perifornical (PeF) orexin (Ox)-ergic neurons are reported to increase waking and reduce NREMS as well as REMS; dysfunction of the PeF neurons are related to REMS loss-associated disorders. Hence, we were interested in understanding the neural mechanism of PeF-induced REMS modulation. As a first step we have recently reported that PeF Ox-ergic neurons modulate REMS by influencing the LC neurons (site for REM-OFF neurons). Thereafter, in this in vivo study we have explored the role of PeF inputs on the PPT neurons (site for REM-ON neurons) for the regulation of REMS. Chronic male rats were surgically prepared with implanted bilateral cannulae in PeF and PPT and electrodes for recording sleep-waking patterns. After post-surgical recovery sleep-waking-REMS were recorded when bilateral PeF neurons were stimulated by glutamate and simultaneously bilateral PPT neurons were infused with either saline or orexin receptor1 (OX1R) antagonist. It was observed that PeF stimulation increased waking and decreased NREMS as well as REMS, which were prevented by OX1R antagonist into the PPT. We conclude that the PeF stimulation-induced reduction in REMS was likely to be due to inhibition of REM-ON neurons in the PPT. As waking and NREMS are inversely related, subject to confirmation, the reduction in NREMS could be due to increased waking or vice versa. Based on our findings from this and earlier studies we have proposed a model showing connections between PeF- and PPT-neurons for REMS regulation.

AB  - Abstract
Two neuropeptides, orexin-A and orexin-B (also called hypocretin-1 and -2), have been implicated in sleep/wake regulation, feeding behaviors via the activation of two subtypes of G-protein-coupled receptors: orexin 1 and orexin 2 receptors (OX1R and OX2R). While the expression of orexins and orexin receptors is immunohistochemically revealed in retinal neurons, the function of these peptides in the retina is largely unknown. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in rat retinal slices, we demonstrated that orexin-A increased L-type-like barium currents (IBa,L) in ganglion cells (GCs), and the effect was blocked by the selective OX1R antagonist SB334867, but not by the OX2R antagonist TCS OX2 29. The orexin-A effect was abolished by intracellular dialysis of GDP-β-S/GPAnt-2A, a Gq protein inhibitor, suggesting the mediation of Gq. Additionally, during internal dialysis of the phosphatidylinositol (PI)-phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122, orexin-A did not change the IBa,L of GCs, whereas the orexin-A effect persisted in the presence of the phosphatidylcholine (PC)-PLC inhibitor D609. The orexin-A-induced potentiation was not seen with internal infusion of Ca2+-free solution or when inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive Ca2+ release from intracellular stores was blocked by heparin/xestospongins-C. Moreover, the orexin-A effect was mimicked by the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, but was eliminated when PKC was inhibited by bisindolylmaleimide IV (Bis-IV)/Gö6976. Neither adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) nor guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP)-protein kinase G (PKG) signaling pathway was likely involved, as orexin-A persisted to potentiate the IBa,L of GCs no matter these two pathways were activated or inhibited. These results suggest that, by activating OX1R, orexin-A potentiates the IBa,L of rat GCs through a distinct Gq/PI-PLC/IP3/Ca2+/PKC signaling pathway.

AB  - Abstract
Hearing loss of patients with enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct (EVA) can fluctuate or progress, with overall downward progression. The most common detectable cause of EVA is mutations of SLC26A4. We previously described a transgenic Slc26a4-insufficient mouse model of EVA in which Slc26a4 expression is controlled by doxycycline administration. Mice that received doxycycline from conception until embryonic day 17.5 (DE17.5; doxycycline discontinued at embryonic day 17.5) had fluctuating hearing loss between 1 and 6 months of age with an overall downward progression after 6 months of age. In this study, we characterized the cochlear functional and structural changes underlying irreversible hearing loss in DE17.5 mice at 12 months of age. The endocochlear potential was decreased and inversely correlated with auditory brainstem response thresholds. The stria vascularis was thickened and edematous in ears with less severe hearing loss, and thinned and atrophic in ears with more severe hearing loss. There were pathologic changes in marginal cell morphology and gene expression that were not observed at 3 months. We conclude that strial dysfunction and degeneration are the primary causes of irreversible progressive hearing loss in our Slc26a4-insufficient mouse model of EVA. This model of primary strial atrophy may be used to explore the mechanisms of progressive hearing loss due to strial dysfunction.

AB  - Abstract
Objective: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare but life-threatening disease and an animal model for in-depth study of CVST is needed. This study aimed to develop a rat model suitable for studying clinically relevant aspects of CVST and investigating its dynamic pathophysiological changes during a 7-day period. Method: A photothrombosis method was used to create a rat sinus-vein thrombosis model. A spot size-adjustable Diode Pumped Solid State laser (DPSS) combined with thrombin injection occluded the rostral and caudal superior sagittal sinus (SSS). The model was used to evaluate pathophysiological changes at different time points over 7 days. Evans Blue dye injection was used to detect alterations in blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Brain water content was also measured. Moreover, we examined changes in brain infarct volume, neurological function, as well as histology after induction of CVST. Result: CVST in rats significantly altered BBB permeability, consistent with the development of brain edema. It was accompanied by an increase in brain infarct volume and deficits in neurological function that began on day 1, peaked on day 2, and typically improved by day 7 due to the neuroprotective effects of angiogenesis and gliocyte proliferation. Conclusion: In this study, we describe a rat model that produces clinically relevant pathophysiology and pathology that will facilitate evaluation of therapeutic regimens for CVST. Furthermore, our results indicate a period of optimal clinical intervention for patients with CVST, which may reduce the probability of dependency and death.

AB  - Abstract
Infancy is a critical period for brain development. Emerging evidence indicates that stress experienced during that period can have long-term programming effects on the brain and behavior. However, whether different time periods represent different vulnerabilities to the programming of different neurobehavioral domains is not yet known. Disrupted maternal care is known to interfere with neurodevelopmental processes and may lead to the manifestation of behavioral abnormalities in adulthood. Mouse dams confronted with insufficient bedding/nesting material have been shown to provide fragmented maternal care to their offspring. Here, we compared the impact of this model of early-life stress (ELS) during different developmental periods comprising either postnatal days (PNDs) 2–9 (ELS-early) or PND 10–17 (ELS-late) on behavior and hippocampal cell adhesion molecules in male mice in adulthood. ELS-early treatment caused a permanent reduction in bodyweight, whereas this reduction only occurred transiently during juvenility in ELS-late mice. Anxiety was only affected in ELS-late mice, while cognition and sociability were equally impaired in both ELS-treated groups. We analyzed hippocampal gene expression of the γ2 subunit of the GABAa receptor (Gabrg2) and of genes encoding cell adhesion molecules. Gabrg2 expression was increased in the ventral hippocampus in ELS-late-treated animals and was correlated with anxiety-like behavior in the open-field (OF) test. ELS-early-treated animals exhibited an increase in nectin-1 expression in the dorsal hippocampus, and this increase was associated with the social deficits seen in these animals. Our findings highlight the relevance of developmental age on stress-induced long-term behavioral alterations. They also suggest potential links between early stress-induced alterations in hippocampal Gabrg2 expression and the developmental programming of anxiety and between changes in hippocampal nectin-1 expression and stress-induced social impairments.

AB  - Abstract
Neuronal differentiation is a critical developmental process that determines accurate synaptic connection and circuit wiring. A wide variety of naturally occurring compounds have been shown as promising drug leads for the generation and differentiation of neurons. Here we report that a diarylheptanoid from the plant Alpinia officinarum, 7-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-phenyl-4E-hepten-3-one (Cpd 1), exhibited potent activities in neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth. Cpd 1 induced differentiation of neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells into a neuron-like morphology, and accelerated the establishment of axon-dendrite polarization of cultured hippocampal neurons. Moreover, Cpd 1 promoted neurite extension in both Neuro-2a cells and neurons. We showed that the effects of Cpd 1 on neuronal differentiation and neurite growth were specifically dependent on the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathways. Importantly, intraperitoneal administration of Cpd 1 promoted the differentiation of new-born progenitor cells into mature neurons in the adult hippocampal dentate gyrus. Collectively, this study identifies a naturally occurring diarylheptanoid with beneficial effects on neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth in vitro and in vivo.

AB  - Abstract
In the brain, CB1 cannabinoid receptors primarily mediate the effects of cannabinoids, but CB2 cannabinoid receptors (CB2Rs) have recently been discovered in the nervous system and also implicated in neuromodulatory roles. To understand the mechanisms of CB2R functions in the brain, it is essential to localize CB2Rs, but the types of cells expressing CB2Rs have been controversial. Unequivocal localization of CB2Rs in the brain has been impeded in part by the low expression levels of CB2Rs and poor specificity of detection methods. Here, we used an ultrasensitive and specific in situ hybridization method called the RNAscope to determine the spatial pattern of CB2R mRNA expression in the mouse hippocampus. CB2R mRNAs were mostly expressed in a subset of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus areas, but rarely in microglia. CB2R knock-out mice were used as a negative control. Using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we also found that the temporal pattern of CB2R mRNA expression was stable during postnatal development. Consistent with previous reports, the immunological detection of CB2Rs was not reliable, implying extremely low levels of the protein expression and/or insufficient specificity of the current anti-CB2R antibodies. Our findings of the expression patterns of CB2R mRNAs may help determine the cell types involved in, and hence the mechanisms of, the CB2R-mediated neuromodulation.

AB  - Abstract
Background: Cerebral ischemia–reperfusion (IR) injury is a complex pathological process that can cause irreversible brain damage, neuronal injury or death from brain ischemia. Rac1 GTPase is involved in cellular protection from IR injury. However, the mechanism of protection and the molecules affected by Rac1 remain to be defined. Methods and results: C57BL/6 mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion for 1 h, followed by 24-h reperfusion. In this in vivo model of cerebral IR injury, mice treated with the Rac GTPase inhibitor NSC23766 or Rac1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) had better short-term (72 h) neurologic scores, less infarction volume, higher production of antioxidant enzymes, lower lipid peroxide, and reduced apoptosis compared with a vehicle-treated group or a control-siRNA group. However, long-term (14 day) neurologic scores were worse for the two treatments compared to controls. Microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed that Notch2 was downregulated under NSC23766 treatment. Notch2 protein levels decreased with NSC23766 and Rac1 siRNA in vitro and in vivo. Cell survival increased with the Notch signaling inhibitor DAPT or Notch2 siRNA and NICD2 attenuated the NSC23766 effect. In addition, immunoblotting showed that DAPT and Notch2 siRNA changed the levels of apoptosis-regulating proteins. NFkB mediated Rac1, which regulated Notch2 in an oxygen glucose deprivation model. Both inhibitors of Notch2 and Rac1 enhanced neural stem cell differentiation. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the importance of Rac1 regulation of Notch2 in mediating cerebral IR-induced production of injurious reactive oxygen species and cell death in vitro and in vivo in the short term. Targeted inhibition of Rac1 or Notch2 is new avenue for in vivo therapy aimed at protecting organs at risk from IR injury.

AB  - Abstract
Epilepsy and seizure activity result in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which contribute to seizure-induced neuronal damage. Recent in vitro evidence indicates that NADPH oxidase contributes significantly to seizure-induced ROS. We further tested this in rat glio-neuronal cultures and in ex vivo chronic epileptic rat brain tissue using live cell-imaging techniques. Here, we show that ROS are upregulated in chronic epilepsy and that ROS production contributes to cell death, which is seen after status epilepticus (SE) and chronic seizures. Inhibition of ROS production by AEBSF, a NADPH oxidase inhibitor, markedly reduced seizure-induced cell death in the perforant path model of epilepsy. These findings demonstrate a critical role for ROS, generated by NADPH oxidase, contributing to seizure-induced cell death. These findings point to NADPH oxidase inhibition as a novel treatment strategy to prevent brain injury in SE and chronic epilepsy.

AB  - Abstract
The hippocampus has a pivotal role in learning and in the formation and consolidation of memory and is critically involved in the regulation of emotion, fear, anxiety, and stress. Studies of the hippocampus have been central to the study of memory in humans and in recent years, the regional specialization and organization of hippocampal functions have been elucidated in experimental models and in human neurological and psychiatric diseases. The hippocampus has long been considered a classic model for the study of neuroplasticity as many examples of synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation and -depression have been identified and demonstrated in hippocampal circuits. Neuroplasticity is the ability to adapt and reorganize the structure or function to internal or external stimuli and occurs at the cellular, population, network or behavioral level and is reflected in the cytological and network architecture as well as in intrinsic properties of hippocampal neurons and circuits. The high degree of hippocampal neuroplasticity might, however, be also negatively reflected in the pronounced vulnerability of the hippocampus to deleterious conditions such as ischemia, epilepsy, chronic stress, neurodegeneration and aging targeting hippocampal structure and function and leading to cognitive deficits. Considering this framework of plasticity and vulnerability, we here review basic principles of hippocampal anatomy and neuroplasticity on various levels as well as recent findings regarding the functional organization of the hippocampus in light of the regional vulnerability in Alzheimer’s disease, ischemia, epilepsy, neuroinflammation and aging.

AB  - Abstract
The clinical use of benzodiazepines is limited by the development of tolerance to their pharmacological effects. Tolerance to each of the pharmacological actions of benzodiazepines develops at different rates. The aim of this work was to investigate the mechanism of tolerance by performing behavioral tests in combination with biochemical studies. To this end, we administered prolonged treatments of diazepam to rats for 7 or 14 days. Tolerance to the sedative effects of diazepam was detected by means of the open field test after the 7- and 14-day treatments, whereas tolerance to the anxiolytic actions of benzodiazepine manifested following only the 14-day treatment in the elevated plus maze. The cerebral cortical concentrations of diazepam did not decline after the diazepam treatments, indicating that tolerance was not due to alterations in pharmacokinetic factors. The uncoupling of GABA/benzodiazepine site interactions and an increase in the degree of phosphorylation of the GABAA receptor γ2 subunit at serine 327 in the cerebral cortex were produced by day 7 of diazepam treatment and persisted after 14 days of exposure to benzodiazepine. Thus, these alterations could be part of the mechanism of tolerance to the sedative effects of diazepam. An increase in the percentage of α1-containing GABAA receptors in the cerebral cortex was observed following the 14-day treatment with diazepam but not the 7-day treatment, suggesting that tolerance to the anxiolytic effects is associated with a change in receptor subunit composition. The understanding of the molecular bases of tolerance could be important for the development of new drugs that maintain their efficacies over long-term treatments.

AB  - Abstract
Microglia play major roles in initiation, coordination and execution of innate immunity in the brain. In the adult brain, these include maintenance of homeostasis, neuron and tissue repair, and eliminating infectious agents, apoptotic cells, and misfolded proteins. Some of these activities are accompanied by inflammatory reactions; and others are performed with no inflammatory effects. Under normal conditions, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) belongs to the second category. It pairs with the adaptor protein DNAX-activating protein of 12 kDa (DAP12) to induce phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons without inflammatory responses, and to regulate Toll-like receptor-mediated inflammatory responses, and microglial activation. Although ligands for TREM2 are largely unknown, the mitochondrial heat shock protein 60, expressed on cell surface of apoptotic neurons, is a specific ligand that activates TREM2-mediated phagocytosis by microglia. TREM2 also phagocytoses amyloid beta peptide in cultured cells. Several TREM2 mutations have been identified recently that increase the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, Frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Some of these mutations cause impaired proteolysis of full-length TREM2 at the plasma membrane to different degrees. The defects in the intramembrane cleavage result in dysfunction of phagocytosis signaling. The association of TREM2 mutations with neurodegenerative disease also calls for the understanding of the biology and pathological role of non-mutated TREM2 on human brains and microglia. This review provides a summary of current literature in TREM2 and DAP12 from several aspects, and proposes a theory that loss of TREM2 functions might contribute to the immunopathogenic role of microglia in Alzheimer’s disease.

AB  - Abstract
Sexually dimorphic neural structures regulate numerous gender-specific functions including luteinizing hormone (LH) release patterns. The female cyclic surge pattern of release is controlled by the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV), a preoptic area (POA) region that is significantly smaller in males. The prevailing hypothesis used to explain these differences in structure and function is that a “default” feminine AVPV is defeminized by exposure to estradiol (E2), a metabolite of testosterone (T) produced by the perinatal testes. E2 exposure then culminates in apoptosis in the male AVPV, but the upstream pathways are poorly understood. To address this issue, we compared AVPV transcriptomes of postnatal day 2 (PND2) males and females with those of females treated with E2 or vehicle. Only six of 89 sex-specific genes were also regulated by E2 in the PND2 AVPV and E2 regulated over 280 genes not found to be sex-specific. Of targets that changed similarly in males and E2-treated females, the gene encoding CUG triplet repeat, RNA-binding protein 2 (Cugbp2), a proapoptotic protein, showed the highest fold-changes. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) studies confirmed higher mRNA levels in PND2 male and E2-treated female AVPVs wherein E2 induces apoptosis. POA mapping studies detected Cugbp2 mRNA in the AVPV and in the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the POA (SDN–POA); however, sex differences and E2 effects occurred only in the AVPV. Combined with evidence that Cugbp2 regulates splicing and translation of mRNAs linked to sexual differentiation, we propose that this gene mediates E2-dependent effects on AVPV defeminization.

AB  - Abstract
Anxiety is a complex and adaptive emotional state controlled by a distributed and interconnected network of brain regions, and disruption of these networks is thought to give rise to the behavioral symptoms associated with anxiety disorders in humans. The dorsal raphe nucleus (DR), which contains the majority of forebrain-projecting serotonergic neurons, is implicated in the control of anxiety states and anxiety-related behavior via neuromodulatory effects on these networks. Relaxin-3 is the native neuropeptide ligand for the Gi/o-protein-coupled receptor, RXFP3, and is primarily expressed in the nucleus incertus (NI), a tegmental region immediately caudal to the DR. RXFP3 activation has been shown to modulate anxiety-related behavior in rodents, and RXFP3 mRNA is expressed in the DR. In this study, we examined the response of relaxin-3-containing neurons in the NI and serotonergic neurons in the DR following pharmacologically induced anxiety and exposure to an aversive environment. We administered the anxiogenic drug FG-7142 or vehicle to adult male Wistar rats and, 30 min later, exposed them to either the elevated plus-maze or home cage control conditions. Immunohistochemical detection of c-Fos was used to determine activation of serotonergic neurons in the DR and relaxin-3 neurons in the NI, measured 2 h following drug injection. Analysis revealed that FG-7142 administration and exposure to the elevated plus-maze are both associated with an increase in c-Fos expression in relaxin-3-containing neurons in the NI and in serotonergic neurons in dorsal and ventrolateral regions of the DR. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that relaxin-3 systems in the NI and serotonin systems in the DR interact to form part of a network involved in the control of anxiety-related behavior.

In vitro cell cultures are an important tool for obtaining insights into cellular processes in an isolated system and a supplement to in vivo animal experiments. While primary dissociated cultures permit a single homogeneous cell population to be studied, there is a clear need to explore the function of brain cells in a three-dimensional system where the main architecture of the cells is preserved. Thus, organotypic brain slice cultures have proven to be very useful in investigating cellular and molecular processes of the brain in vitro. This review summarizes (1) the historical development of organotypic brain slices focusing on the membrane technology, (2) methodological aspects regarding culturing procedures, age of donors or media, (3) whether the cholinergic neurons serve as a model of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease, (4) or the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons as a model of Parkinson’s disease and (5) how the vascular network can be studied, especially with regard to a synthetic blood–brain barrier. This review will also highlight some limits of the model and give an outlook on future applications.

AB  - Abstract
Individuals’ reading skills are critical for their educational development, but variation in reading skills is known to be large. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the role of spontaneous brain activity at rest in individual differences in reading skills in a large sample of participants (N = 263). Specifically, we correlated individuals’ word-reading skill with their fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) of the whole brain at rest and found that the fALFFs of both the bilateral precentral gyrus (PCG) and superior temporal plane (STP) were positively associated with reading skills. The fALFF–reading association observed in these two regions remained after controlling for general cognitive abilities and in-scanner head motion. A cross-validation confirmed that the individual differences in word-reading skills were reliably correlated with the fALFF values of the bilateral PCG and STP. A follow-up task-based fMRI experiment revealed that the reading-related regions overlapped with regions showing a higher response to sentences than to pseudo-sentences (strings of pseudo-words), suggesting the resting-state brain activity partly captures the characteristics of task-based brain activity. In short, our study provides one of the first pieces of evidence that links spontaneous brain activity to reading behavior and offers an easy-to-access neural marker for evaluating reading skill.

AB  - Abstract
Background: The activation of renin angiotensin system is involved in multiple pathological processes. The neuroprotective effect of propofol has been reported. We hypothesized that propofol may attenuate Angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced apoptosis in mouse hippocampal HT22 cells and aimed to identify the underlying mechanisms. Methods: Mouse hippocampal HT22 cells were pre-treated with propofol, and stimulated with Ang II. Apoptosis was examined by transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining and caspase-3 activity assay. The effect of propofol on Ang II-modulated neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) expression, nitric oxide (NO) production, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase expression and activity, caspase activity and metallothinonein-3 (MT-3) expression were measured. Results: Compared with control, Ang II concentration- and time-dependently induced apoptosis, which was attenuated by propofol in a concentration-dependent manner. Ang II (1 μM, 3 h) induced the expression of nNOS and NADPH oxidase, caused NO and superoxide anion accumulation, thus leading to excessive oxidative stress. Ang II also induced cytochrome C release and the activation of caspase 9 as well as caspase 3. In addition, Ang II reduced the expression of MT-3. Importantly, these effects were alleviated by 50 μM propofol, nNOS inhibitor S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline (SMTC) and angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) blocker losartan, but not AT2R blocker PD123319. Conclusions: Ang II via AT1R induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in hippocampal HT22 cells, and the neuroprotective anti-apoptotic effect of propofol was mediated through inhibiting oxidative stress.

AB  - Abstract
This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigated the brain regions underlying language task performance in adult second language (L2) learners. Specifically, we identified brain regions where the level of activation was associated with L2 fluency levels. Thirty Japanese-speaking adults participated in the study. All participants were L2 learners of English and had achieved varying levels of fluency, as determined by a standardized L2 English proficiency test, the Versant English Test (Pearson Education Inc., 2011). When participants performed the oral sentence building task from the production tasks administered, the dorsal part of the left inferior frontal gyrus (dIFG) showed activation patterns that differed depending on the L2 fluency levels: The more fluent the participants were, the more dIFG activation decreased. This decreased activation of the dIFG might reflect the increased automaticity of a syntactic building process. In contrast, when participants performed an oral story comprehension task, the left posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) showed increased activation with higher fluency levels. This suggests that the learners with higher L2 fluency were actively engaged in post-syntactic integration processing supported by the left pSTG. These data imply that L2 fluency predicts neural resource allocation during language comprehension tasks as well as in production tasks. This study sheds light on the neural underpinnings of L2 learning by identifying the brain regions recruited during different language tasks across different modalities (production vs. comprehension).

AB  - Abstract
The purpose of the present study was to test the prediction that the unique manifestation of chemotherapeutic-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) would be reflected in a specific pattern of changes in the regulation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in subpopulations of cutaneous neurons. To test this prediction, we characterized the pattern of changes in mechanical nociceptive threshold associated with paclitaxel administration (2 mg/kg, iv, every other day for four days), as well as the impact of target of innervation and paclitaxel treatment on the regulation of [Ca2+]i in subpopulations of putative nociceptive and non-nociceptive neurons. Neurons innervating the glabrous and hairy skin of the hindpaw as well as the thigh were identified with retrograde tracers, and fura-2 was used to assess changes in [Ca2+]i. Paclitaxel was associated with a persistent decrease in mechanical nociceptive threshold in response to stimuli applied to the glabrous skin of the hindpaw, but not the hairy skin of the hindpaw or the thigh. However, in both putative nociceptive and non-nociceptive neurons, resting [Ca2+]i was significantly lower in neurons innervating the thigh after treatment. The magnitude of the depolarization-evoked Ca2+ transient was also lower in putative non-nociceptive thigh neurons. More interestingly, while paclitaxel had no detectable influence on either resting or depolarization-evoked Ca2+ transients in putative non-nociceptive neurons, in putative nociceptive neurons there was a subpopulation-specific decrease in the duration of the evoked Ca2+ transient that was largely restricted to neurons innervating the glabrous skin. These results suggest that peripheral nerve length alone, does not account for the selective distribution of CIPN symptoms. Rather, they suggest the symptoms of CIPN reflect an interaction between the toxic actions of the therapeutic and unique properties of the neurons deleteriously impacted.

AB  - Abstract
The inferior colliculus (IC) receives many corticofugal projections, which can mediate plastic changes such as shifts in frequency tuning or excitability of IC neurons. While the densest projections are found in the IC’s external cortices, fibers originating from the primary auditory cortex (AI) have been observed throughout the IC’s central nucleus (ICC), and these projections have shown to be organized tonotopically. Some studies have also found projections from other core and non-core cortical regions, though the organization and function of these projections are less known. In guinea pig, there exists a non-core ventrorostral belt (VRB) region that has primary-like properties and has often been mistaken for AI, with the clearest differentiating characteristic being VRB’s longer response latencies. To better understand the auditory corticofugal descending system beyond AI, we investigated if there are projections from VRB to the ICC and if they exhibit a different projection pattern than those from AI. In this study, we performed experiments in ketamine-anesthetized guinea pigs, in which we positioned 32-site electrode arrays within AI, VRB, and ICC. We identified the monosynaptic connections between AI-to-ICC and VRB-to-ICC using an antidromic stimulation method, and we analyzed their locations across the midbrain using three-dimensional histological techniques. Compared to the corticocollicular projections to the ICC from AI, there were fewer projections to the ICC from VRB, and these projections had a weaker tonotopic organization. The majority of VRB projections were observed in the caudal–medial versus the rostral–lateral region along an isofrequency lamina of the ICC, which is in contrast to the AI projections that were scattered throughout an ICC lamina. These findings suggest that the VRB directly modulates sound information within the ascending lemniscal pathway with a different or complementary role compared to the modulatory effects of AI, which may have implications for treating hearing disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Repeated social defeat (RSD) in mice causes myeloid cell trafficking to the brain that contributes to the development of prolonged anxiety-like behavior. Myeloid cell recruitment following RSD occurs in regions where neuronal and microglia activation is observed. Thus, we hypothesized that crosstalk between neurons, microglia, and endothelial cells contributes to brain myeloid cell trafficking via chemokine signaling and vascular adhesion molecules. Here we show that social defeat caused an exposure- and brain region-dependent increase in several key adhesion molecules and chemokines involved in the recruitment of myeloid cells. For example, RSD induced distinct patterns of adhesion molecule expression that may explain brain region-dependent myeloid cell trafficking. VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 mRNA expression were increased in an exposure-dependent manner. Furthermore, RSD-induced VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 protein expression were localized to the vasculature of brain regions implicated in fear and anxiety responses, which spatially corresponded to previously reported patterns of myeloid cell trafficking. Next, mRNA expression of additional adhesion molecules (E- and P-selectin, PECAM-1) and chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL12, CCL2) were determined in the brain. Social defeat induced an exposure-dependent increase in mRNA levels of E-selectin, CXCL1, and CXCL2 that increased with additional days of social defeat. While CXCL12 was unaffected by RSD, CCL2 expression was increased by six days of social defeat. Last, comparison between enriched CD11b+ cells (microglia/macrophages) and enriched GLAST-1+/CD11b− cells (astrocytes) revealed RSD increased mRNA expression of IL-1β, CCL2, and CXCL2 in microglia/macrophages but not in astrocytes. Collectively, these data indicate that key mediators of leukocyte recruitment were increased in the brain vasculature following RSD in an exposure- and brain region-dependent manner.

AB  - Abstract
We have previously demonstrated that multiple sclerosis (MS) patients have abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the key myelin-related molecules cobalamin (Cbl), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and normal cellular prions (PrPCs), thus confirming that some CSF abnormalities may be co-responsible for remyelination failure. We determined the levels of these three molecules in post-mortem spinal cord (SC) samples taken from MS patients and control patients. The control SC samples, almost all of which came from non-neurological patients, did not show any microscopic lesions of any type. All of the samples were supplied by the U.K. MS Tissue Bank. The Cbl, EGF, and PrPC levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The SC total homocysteine level was determined using a competitive immunoenzymatic assay. CSF samples, taken from a further group of MS patients, were used for the assay of holo-transcobalamin (holo-TC) levels. The Cbl, EGF, and PrPC levels were significantly decreased in MS SCs in comparison with controls and, paradoxically, the decreased Cbl levels were associated with decreased SC levels of homocysteine, a biochemical marker of Cbl deficiency. The trends of EGF and PrPC levels paralleled those previously found in CSF, whereas that of Cbl was the opposite. There was no significant difference in CSF holo-TC levels between the MS patients and the controls. Given that we have previously demonstrated that Cbl positively regulates central nervous system EGF levels, it is conceivable that the low EGF levels in the MS SC may be causally related to a local decrease in Cbl levels. Only PrPC levels were invariably decreased in both the SC and CSF regardless of the clinical course of the disease. These findings suggest that the simultaneous lack of Cbl, EGF, and PrPCs may greatly hamper the remyelination process in MS patients, because they are key molecules of the machinery for remyelination.

AB  - Abstract
Inflammation has long been associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) but the extent to which it is a cause or consequence is sill debated. Over the past decade a number of genes have been implicated in PD. Relatively rare missense mutations in genes such as LRRK2, Parkin, SNCA and PINK1 are causative for familial PD whereas more common variation in genes, including LRRK2, SNCA and GBA, comprise risk factors for sporadic PD. Determining how the function of these genes and the proteins they encode are altered in PD has become a priority, as results will likely provide much needed insights into contributing causes. Accumulating evidence indicates that many of these genes function in pathways that regulate aspects of immunity, particularly inflammation, suggesting close associations between PD and immune homeostasis.

AB  - Abstract
We previously reported that inbred, genetically identical mice living in one enriched environment develop individual behavioral trajectories, indicating increasingly different levels of spatial exploratory behavior as quantified by roaming entropy. Cumulative roaming entropy (cRE) correlated positively with adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a type of plasticity involved in the flexible integration of new information into existing contexts (Freund et al., 2013). The study on which we report here was done in parallel to that first experiment, but here we acquired detailed observational data on the behavior of individual mice. Roaming entropy (RE) was again assessed in real-time with an antenna-based system over the entire experimental period of 3 months. Compared to the least active mice in the enclosure (low number of antenna contacts), the most active animals showed tendencies of increased socially interactive behavior in the final observation block whereas least active mice displayed more self-related behavior (non-social local exploration and play). When looking at roaming behavior, we discovered that RE correlated negatively with latent factors representing social exploratory and non-social exploratory and play behavior. Adult neurogenesis could not be studied in the present cohort but we do know that under identical conditions, cumulative RE correlated positively with adult hippocampal neurogenesis. We can thus hypothesize that the mice with more exploratory experience in terms of areal coverage (as quantified by RE) and related greater levels of adult hippocampal plasticity, might also be the ones that were less involved in interactions within the group and, hence, more individualistic. While this remains to be confirmed experimentally, the present data suggest that the described mechanism of individualization, which has previously been shown to be hippocampus-dependent, has a social component.

Primary somatosensory cortex (S1) contains a nociceptive map that localizes potential tissue damage on the body and encodes stimulus intensity. An objective and specific biomarker of pain however is currently lacking and is urgently required for use in non-verbal clinical populations as well as in the validation of pre-clinical pain models. Here we describe studies to see if the responses of the S1 in juvenile rats are different to those in the adult. We recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) responses from S1 of lightly-anesthetized Sprague–Dawley rats at either postnatal day 21 or postnatal day 40 during the presentation of noxious (55 °C) or innocuous (30 °C) thermal stimuli applied to the plantar surface of the left hindpaw. The total EEG power across the recording period was the same in both ages after stimulation but the frequency distribution was significantly affected by age. Noxious heat evoked a significant increase in theta band (4–8 Hz) activity in adults only (P &lt; 0.0001 compared to baseline; P &lt; 0.0001 compared to juveniles). There were no significant differences in EEG responses to innocuous thermal stimuli. These data show that there are significant alterations in the processing of nociceptive inputs within the maturing cortex and that cortical theta activity is involved only in the adult cortical response to noxious stimulation.

AB  - Abstract
Olfactory bulb granule cells (GCs) are axon-less, inhibitory interneurons that regulate the activity of the excitatory output neurons, the mitral and tufted cells, through reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses located on GC spines. These contacts are established in the distal apical dendritic compartment, while GC basal dendrites and more proximal apical segments bear spines that receive glutamatergic inputs from the olfactory cortices. This synaptic connectivity is vital to olfactory circuit function and is remodeled during development, and in response to changes in sensory activity and lifelong GC neurogenesis. Manipulations that alter levels of the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in vivo have significant effects on dendritic spine morphology, maintenance and activity-dependent plasticity for a variety of CNS neurons, yet little is known regarding BDNF effects on bulb GC spine maturation or maintenance. Here we show that, in vivo, sustained bulbar over-expression of BDNF in transgenic mice produces a marked increase in GC spine density that includes an increase in mature spines on their apical dendrites. Morphometric analysis demonstrated that changes in spine density were most notable in the distal and proximal apical domains, indicating that multiple excitatory inputs are potentially modified by BDNF. Our results indicate that increased levels of endogenous BDNF can promote the maturation and/or maintenance of dendritic spines on GCs, suggesting a role for this factor in modulating GC functional connectivity within adult olfactory circuitry.

AB  - Abstract
Serotonin transporter blockade with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was recently shown to counteract L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats. However, this effect has never been described in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients, despite that they often receive SSRIs for the treatment of depression. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of the SSRI citalopram against dyskinesia in two experimental models of PD, the 6-OHDA-lesioned rat and 1-methyl-4-phenyl 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated macaque. First, we studied the acute and chronic effect of citalopram, given at different time points before L-DOPA, in L-DOPA-primed parkinsonian rats. Moreover, the acute effect of citalopram was also evaluated in dyskinetic MPTP-treated macaques. In L-DOPA-primed rats, a significant and long-lasting reduction of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) was observed only when citalopram was given 30 min before L-DOPA, suggesting that the time of injection relative to L-DOPA is a key factor for the efficacy of the treatment. Interestingly, an acute challenge with the 5-HT1A/1B receptor agonist eltoprazine, given at the end of the chronic study, was equally effective in reducing LID in rats previously chronically treated with L-DOPA or L-DOPA plus citalopram, suggesting that no auto-receptor desensitization was induced by chronic citalopram treatment. In MPTP-treated macaques, citalopram produced a striking suppression of LID but at the expense of L-DOPA therapeutic efficacy, which represents a concern for possible clinical application.

The role of serotonin7 (5-HT7) receptors in the regulation of depression is poorly understood, particularly in Parkinson’s disease-associated depression. Here we examined whether 5-HT7 receptors in the prelimbic (PrL) sub-region of the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) involve in the regulation of depressive-like behaviors in sham-operated rats and rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the medial forebrain bundle. The lesion induced depressive-like responses as measured by the sucrose preference and forced swim tests when compared to sham-operated rats. Intra-PrL injection of 5-HT7 receptor agonist AS19 (0.5, 1 and 2 μg/rat) increased sucrose consumption, and decreased immobility time in sham-operated and the lesioned rats, indicating the induction of antidepressant-like effects. Further, intra-PrL injection of 5-HT7 receptor antagonist SB269970 (1.5, 3 and 6 μg/rat) decreased sucrose consumption, and increased immobility time, indicating the induction of depressive-like responses. However, the doses producing these effects in the lesioned rats were higher than those in sham-operated rats. Neurochemical results showed that intra-PrL injection of AS19 (2 μg/rat) increased dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and noradrenaline (NA) levels in the mPFC, habenula and ventral hippocampus (vHip) in sham-operated and the lesioned rats; whereas SB269970 (6 μg/rat) decreased 5-HT levels in the habenula and vHip, and the levels of NA in the mPFC, habenula and vHip in the two groups of rats. The results suggest that 5-HT7 receptors in the PrL play an important role in the regulation of these behaviors, which attribute to changes in monoamine levels in the limbic and limbic-related brain regions after activation and blockade of 5-HT7 receptors.

AB  - Abstract
The K+-dependent Na+/Ca2-exchanger (NCKX) family is encoded by five related genes, of which NCKX2 (solute carrier family 24, member 2) is the most abundant member present in the brain. Nckx2 knockout mice display profound loss of hippocampal long-term potentiation, and selective deficits in motor learning and spatial working memory. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes have not been established. Thus, the overall goal of this project was to identify the exact subcellular localization of NCKX2 in the hippocampus, as an important step toward understanding the physiological role for NCKX2 in neuronal plasticity. To achieve this goal, we used dual immunofluorescent confocal microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy. Our data demonstrate that the majority of NCKX2 is co-localized with the dendritic marker, microtubule associated protein 2. A smaller fraction is co-localized with the presynaptic marker, synapsin 1, and the smallest amount is co-localized with the glutamatergic spine marker, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 1. The data from immunoelectron microscopy are consistent with the observations from dual immunofluorescence, and show that the highest fraction of NCKX2 is located on the plasma membrane of small oblique dendrites, particularly in CA1 neurons of the stratum radiatum. In the molecular layer, a greater fraction of NCKX2 is associated with axon terminals and, in addition, a fraction of NCKX2 is found not associated with the plasma membrane but located in the cytoplasm. These studies describe for the first time the exact location of NCKX2 in the hippocampus of adult mice and suggest that the function of NCKX2 in neuronal plasticity in hippocampal CA1 neurons may be mediated by its kinetic effect on the local Ca2+ concentration that influences dendritic integration. At other hippocampal locations NCKX2 has a somewhat different spatial distribution, consistent with published reports of NCKX2 expression in other brain regions, suggesting that NCKX2 contributes to Ca2+ homeostasis in distinct ways in different brain neurons.

AB  - Abstract
Our main goal was to test a hypothesis that transient changes in performance of a steady-state task would result in motor equivalence. We also estimated effects of visual feedback on the amount of reorganization of motor elements. Healthy subjects performed two variations of a four-finger pressing task requiring accurate production of total pressing force (FTOT) and total moment of force (MTOT). In the Jumping-Target task, a sequence of target jumps required transient changes in either FTOT or MTOT. In the Step-Perturbation task, the index finger was lifted by 1 cm for 0.5 s leading to a change in both FTOT and MTOT. Visual feedback could have been frozen for one of these two variables in both tasks. Deviations in the space of finger modes (hypothetical commands to individual fingers) were quantified in directions of unchanged FTOT and MTOT (motor equivalent – ME) and in directions that changed FTOT and MTOT (non-motor equivalence – nME). Both the ME and nME components increased when the performance changed. After transient target jumps leading to the same combination of FTOT and MTOT, the changes in finger modes had a large residual ME component with only a very small nME component. Without visual feedback, an increase in the nME component was observed without consistent changes in the ME component. Results from the Step-Perturbation task were qualitatively similar. These findings suggest that both external perturbations and purposeful changes in performance trigger a reorganization of elements of an abundant system, leading to large ME change. These results are consistent with the principle of motor abundance corroborating the idea that a family of solutions is facilitated to stabilize values of important performance variables.

AB  - Abstract
The recent discovery that mammalian nociceptors express Toll-like receptors (TLRs) has raised the possibility that these cells directly detect and respond to pathogens with implications for either direct nociceptor activation or sensitization. A range of neuronal TLRs have been identified, however a detailed description regarding the distribution of expression of these receptors within sub-populations of sensory neurons is lacking. There is also some debate as to the composition of the TLR4 receptor complex on sensory neurons. Here we use a range of techniques to quantify the expression of TLR4, TLR7 and some associated molecules within neurochemically-identified sub-populations of trigeminal (TG) and dorsal root (DRG) ganglion sensory neurons. We also detail the pattern of expression and co-expression of two isoforms of lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT), a phospholipid remodeling enzyme previously shown to be involved in the lipopolysaccharide-dependent TLR4 response in monocytes, within sensory ganglia. Immunohistochemistry shows that both TLR4 and TLR7 preferentially co-localize with transient receptor potential vallinoid 1 (TRPV1) and purinergic receptor P2X ligand-gated ion channel 3 (P2X3), markers of nociceptor populations, within both TG and DRG. A gene expression profile shows that TG sensory neurons express a range of TLR-associated molecules. LPCAT1 is expressed by a proportion of both nociceptors and non-nociceptive neurons. LPCAT2 immunostaining is absent from neuronal profiles within both TG and DRG and is confined to non-neuronal cell types under naïve conditions. Together, our results show that nociceptors express the molecular machinery required to directly respond to pathogenic challenge independently from the innate immune system.

In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), numerous β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques are associated with butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity, the significance of which is unclear. A mouse model, containing five human familial AD genes (5XFAD), also develops Aβ plaques with BChE activity. Knock-out of BChE in this model showed diminished fibrillar Aβ plaque deposition, more so in males than females. This suggests that lack of BChE reduces deposition of fibrillar Aβ in AD and this effect may be influenced by sex.

AB  - Abstract
Emotional memories represent the core of human and animal life and drive future choices and behaviors. Early research involving brain lesion studies in animals lead to the idea that the auditory cortex participates in emotional learning by processing the sensory features of auditory stimuli paired with emotional consequences and by transmitting this information to the amygdala. Nevertheless, electrophysiological and imaging studies revealed that, following emotional experiences, the auditory cortex undergoes learning-induced changes that are highly specific, associative and long lasting. These studies suggested that the role played by the auditory cortex goes beyond stimulus elaboration and transmission. Here, we discuss three major perspectives created by these data. In particular, we analyze the possible roles of the auditory cortex in emotional learning, we examine the recruitment of the auditory cortex during early and late memory trace encoding, and finally we consider the functional interplay between the auditory cortex and subcortical nuclei, such as the amygdala, that process affective information. We conclude that, starting from the early phase of memory encoding, the auditory cortex has a more prominent role in emotional learning, through its connections with subcortical nuclei, than is typically acknowledged.

AB  - Abstract
Presynaptic kainate-type glutamate ionotropic receptors (KARs) that mediate either the depression or the facilitation of GABA release have been intensively studied. Little attention has been given to the modulation of GABAA receptors (GABAARs) by postsynaptic KARs. Recent studies suggest that two GABAAR populations, synaptic (sGABAAR) and extrasynaptic (eGABAAR) GABAARs, mediate phasic and tonic forms of inhibition, respectively. Tonic inhibition plays an important role in the excitability of neuronal circuits and the occurrence of epileptic seizures. For this study, we are the first to report that the activation of postsynaptic KARs by the KAR agonist, Kainic acid (KA, 5 μM), enhanced tonic inhibition by potentiating eGABAARs. KA enhanced THIP-induced eGABAAR currents and prolonged the rise and decay time of muscimol-induced sGABAAR/eGABAAR currents, but also depressed the amplitude of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), unitary IPSCs (uIPSCs), and muscimol-induced sGABAAR/eGABAAR currents. The PKC inhibitor, staurosporine (1 μM), in the patch pipette solution fully blocked the KA-induced potentiation of tonic inhibition, suggesting the involvement of an intracellular PKC pathway. Our study suggests that the activation of postsynaptic KARs potentiates eGABAARs but depresses sGABAARs. By activating postsynaptic KARs, synaptically released glutamate depresses phasic inhibition to facilitate neuronal plasticity, but potentiates tonic inhibition to protect neurons from over-excitation.

AB  - Abstract
Inter-connected brain areas coordinate to process information and synchronized neural activities engage in learning and memory processes. Recent electrophysiological studies in rodents have implicated hippocampal–prefrontal connectivity in anxiety, spatial learning and memory-related tasks. In human patients with schizophrenia and autism, robust reduced connectivity between the hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been reported. However little is known about the directionality of these oscillations and their roles during active behaviors remain unclear. Here the directional information processing in mice was measured by Granger causality, a mathematical tool that has been used in neuroscience to quantify the oscillatory driving relationship between the ventral HPC (vHPC) and the PFC in two anxiety tests and between the dorsal HPC (dHPC) and the PFC in social interaction test. In the open field test, stronger vHPC driving to the PFC was found in the center compartment than in the wall area. In the light–dark box test, PFC to vHPC causality was higher than vHPC to PFC causality although no difference was found between the light and dark areas for the causality in both directions. In the social interaction test using Cx3cr1 knockout mice which model for deficient microglia-dependent synaptic pruning, higher PFC driving to the dHPC was found than driving from the dHPC to the PFC in both knockout mice and wild-type mice. Cx3cr1 knockout mice showed reduced baseline PFC driving to the dHPC compared to their wild-type littermates. PFC to dHPC causality could predict the actual time spent interacting with the social stimuli. The current findings indicate that directed oscillatory activities between the PFC and the HPC have task-dependent roles during exploration in the anxiety test and in the social interaction test.

AB  - Abstract
The possible role that response processes play in Inhibition of Return (IOR), traditionally associated with reduced or inhibited attentional processing of spatially cued target stimuli presented at cue-target intervals longer than 300 ms, is still under debate. Previous psychophysiological studies on response-related Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and IOR have found divergent results. Considering that the ability to optimize our behavior not only resides in our capacity to inhibit the focus of attention from irrelevant information but also to inhibit or reduce motor activation associated with responses to that information, it is conceivable that response processes are also affected by IOR. In the present study, time–frequency (T–F) analyses were performed on EEG oscillatory activity between 2 and 40 Hz to check whether spatial IOR affects response preparation and execution during a visuospatial attention task. To avoid possible spatial stimulus–response compatibility effects and their interaction with the IOR effects, the stimuli were presented along the vertical meridian of the visual field. The results differed between lower and upper visual fields. In the lower visual field spatial IOR was related to a synchronization in the pre-movement mu band at bilateral precentral and central electrodes, and in the post-movement beta band at contralateral precentral and central electrodes, which may be associated with an attention-driven reduction of somatomotor processing prior to the execution of responses to relevant stimuli presented at previously cued locations followed by a post-movement deactivation of motor areas. In the upper visual field, spatial IOR was associated with a decrease in desynchronization around response execution in the beta band at contralateral postcentral electrodes that might indicate a late (last moment) reduction of motor activation when responding to spatially cued targets. The present results suggest that different response processes are affected by spatial IOR depending on the visual field where the target is presented.

AB  - Abstract
Activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), namely PPARγ and PPARδ, has been shown to provide neuroprotection in a number of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease (PD). The observed neuroprotective effects in experimental models of PD have been linked to anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory actions. This study aimed to analyze the full influence of these receptors in neuroprotection by generating a nerve cell-specific conditional knock-out of these receptors and subjecting these genetically modified mice to the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) neurotoxin to model dopaminergic degeneration. Mice null for both receptors show the lowest levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cell bodies following MPTP administration. Presence of one or both these receptors show a trend toward protection against this degeneration, as higher dopaminergic cell immunoreactivity and striatal monoamine levels are evident. These data supplement recent studies that have elected to use agonists of the receptors to regulate immune responses. The results place further importance on the activation of PPARs and the neuroprotective roles these have in inflammatory processes linked to neurodegenerative processes.

AB  - Abstract
The state of protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), via the unfolded protein response (UPR), regulates a pro- or anti-apoptotic cell fate. Hypoxic preconditioning (HPC) is a potent anti-apoptotic stimulus, wherein ischemic neural injury is averted by a non-damaging exposure to hypoxia. We tested if UPR modulation contributes to the pro-survival/anti-apoptotic phenotype in neurons preconditioned with hypoxia, using organotypic cultures of rat hippocampus as a model system. Pharmacologic induction of the UPR with tunicamycin increased mRNA of 79 of 84 UPR genes and replicated the pro-survival phenotype of HPC, whereas only small numbers of the same mRNAs were upregulated at 0, 6 and 24 h after HPC. During the first 24 h after HPC, protein signals in all 3 UPR pathways increased at various times: increased ATF4, phosphorylation of eif2α and IRE1, cleavage of xbb1 mRNA and cleavage of ATF6. Pharmacologic inhibition of ATF6 and IRE1 blocked HPC. Ischemia-like conditions (oxygen/glucose deprivation, OGD) caused extensive neuron cell damage and involved some of the same UPR protein signals as HPC. In distinction to HPC and tunicamycin, OGD caused widespread suppression of UPR genes: 55 of 84 UPR gene mRNAs were numerically downregulated. We conclude that although HPC and ischemic cell death in hippocampal neurons involve protein-based signaling in all 3 UPR pathways, these processes co-opt only a subset of the genomic response elicited by agents known to cause protein misfolding, possibly because of persistent transcription/translation arrest induced by hypoxia and especially OGD.

AB  - Abstract
Sensory information from the orofacial mechanoreceptors are used by the nervous system to optimize the positioning of food, determine the force levels, and force vectors involved in biting of food morsels. Moreover, practice resulting from repetition could be a key to learning and acquiring a motor skill. Hence, the aim of the experiment was to test the hypothesis that repeated splitting of a food morsel during a short-term training with an oral fine motor task would result in increased performance and optimization of jaw movements, in terms of reduction in duration of various phases of the jaw movements. Thirty healthy volunteers were asked to intraorally manipulate and split a chocolate candy, into two equal halves. The participants performed three series (with 10 trials) of the task before and after a short-term (approximately 30 min) training. The accuracy of the split and vertical jaw movement during the task were recorded. The precision of task performance improved significantly after training (22% mean deviation from ideal split after vs. 31% before; P &lt; 0.001). There was a significant decrease in the total duration of jaw movements during the task after the training (1.21 s total duration after vs. 1.56 s before; P &lt; 0.001). Further, when the jaw movements were divided into different phases, the jaw opening phase and contact phase were significantly shorter after training than before training (P = 0.001, P = 0.002). The results indicate that short-term training of an oral fine motor task induces behavior learning, skill acquisition and optimization of jaw movements in terms of better performance and reduction in the duration of jaw movements, during the task. The finding of the present study provides insights into how humans learn oral motor behaviors or the kind of adaptation that takes place after a successful prosthetic rehabilitation.

AB  - Abstract
The major excitatory neurotransmitter Glutamate acts on both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in the central nervous system. mGluR5, a member of the group I mGluR family is widely expressed throughout the brain and plays important roles in a variety of neuronal processes including various forms of synaptic plasticity. This receptor is also involved in various neuropsychiatric disorders, viz., Fragile X syndrome, autism etc. It has been reported that mGluR5 undergoes desensitization and subsequently internalization on ligand exposure in various cell types. However, the downstream events after the internalization and the molecular players involved in the post-endocytic events of this receptor have not been studied. In the present study, we find that subsequent to internalization mGluR5 enters the recycling compartment. After that the receptor recycles back to the cell surface. We also show here that the recycling of mGluR5 is dependent on protein phosphatases. Our data suggest that mGluR5 recycling is completely dependent on the activity of PP2A whereas, PP2B has partial effect on this process. Thus our study suggests that mGluR5 recycles back to the cell surface after ligand-dependent internalization and protein phosphatases that have been implicated in various forms of synaptic plasticity have differential effects on the recycling of mGluR5.

AB  - Abstract
Severe chronic stress can have a profoundly negative impact on the brain, affecting plasticity, neurogenesis, memory and mood. On the other hand, there are factors that upregulate neurogenesis, which include dietary antioxidants and physical activity. These factors are associated with biochemical processes that are also altered in age-related cognitive decline and dementia, such as neurotrophin expression, oxidative stress and inflammation. We exposed mice to an unpredictable series of stressors or left them undisturbed (controls). Subsets of stressed and control mice were concurrently given (1) no additional treatment, (2) a complex dietary supplement (CDS) designed to ameliorate inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, insulin resistance and membrane integrity, (3) a running wheel in each of their home cages that permitted them to exercise, or (4) both the CDS and the running wheel for exercise. Four weeks of unpredictable stress reduced the animals’ preference for saccharin, increased their adrenal weights and abolished the exercise-induced upregulation of neurogenesis that was observed in non-stressed animals. Unexpectedly, stress did not reduce hippocampal size, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), or neurogenesis. The combination of dietary supplementation and exercise had multiple beneficial effects, as reflected in the number of doublecortin (DCX)-positive immature neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG), the sectional area of the DG and hippocampal CA1, as well as increased hippocampal BDNF messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. In contrast, these benefits were not observed in chronically stressed animals exposed to either dietary supplementation or exercise alone. These findings could have important clinical implications for those suffering from chronic stress-related disorders such as major depression.

AB  - Abstract
Two event-related potential (ERP) experiments were conducted to investigate whether Cantonese lexical tones are processed with general auditory perception mechanisms and/or a special speech module. Two tonal features (f0 direction and f0 height deviation) were manipulated to reflect acoustic processing, and the contrast between syllables and hums was used to reveal the involvement of a speech module. Experiment 1 adopted a passive oddball paradigm to study a relatively early stage of tonal processing. Mismatch negativity (MMN) and novelty P3 (P3a) were modulated by the interaction between tonal feature and stimulus type. Similar interactions were found for N2 and P3 in Experiment 2, where more in-depth tonal processing was examined with an active oddball paradigm. Moreover, detecting tonal deviants of syllables elicited N1 and P2 that were not found in hum detection. Together, these findings suggest that the processing of lexical tone relies on both acoustic and linguistic processes from the early stage. Another noteworthy finding is the absence of brain lateralization in both experiments, which challenges the use of a lateralization pattern as evidence for processing lexical tones through a special speech module.

AB  - Abstract
A central component of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is increased distractibility, which is linked to the superior colliculus (SC) in a range of species, including humans. Furthermore, there is now mounting evidence of altered collicular functioning in ADHD and it is proposed that a hyper-responsive SC could mediate the main symptoms of ADHD, including distractibility. In the present study we have provided a systematic characterization of the SC in the most commonly used and well-validated animal model of ADHD, the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). We examined collicular-dependent orienting behavior, local field potential (LFP) and multiunit responses to visual stimuli in the anesthetized rat and morphological measures in the SHR in comparison to the Wistar Kyoto (WKY) and Wistar (WIS). We found that SHRs remain responsive to a repeated visual stimulus for more presentations than control strains and have a longer response duration. In addition, LFP and multiunit activity within the visually responsive superficial layers of the SC showed the SHR to have a hyper-responsive SC relative to control strains, which could not be explained by altered functioning of the retinocollicular pathway. Finally, examination of collicular volume, neuron and glia densities and glia:neuron ratio revealed that the SHR had a reduced ratio relative to the WKY which could explain the increased responsiveness. In conclusion, this study demonstrates strain-specific changes in the functioning and structure of the SC in the SHR, providing convergent evidence that the SC might be dysfunctional in ADHD.

AB  - Abstract
Genetic or nutritional disturbances in one-carbon metabolism, with associated hyperhomocysteinemia, can result in complex disorders including pregnancy complications and neuropsychiatric diseases. In earlier work, we showed that mice with a complete deficiency of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), a critical enzyme in folate and homocysteine metabolism, had cognitive impairment with disturbances in choline metabolism. Maternal demands for folate and choline are increased during pregnancy and deficiencies of these nutrients result in several negative outcomes including increased resorption and delayed development. The goal of this study was to investigate the behavioral and neurobiological impact of a maternal genetic deficiency in MTHFR or maternal nutritional deficiency of folate or choline during pregnancy on 3-week-old Mthfr+/+ offspring. Mthfr+/+ and Mthfr+/− females were placed on control diets (CD); and Mthfr+/+ females were placed on folate-deficient diets (FD) or choline-deficient diets (ChDD) throughout pregnancy and lactation until their offspring were 3 weeks of age. Short-term memory was assessed in offspring, and hippocampal tissue was evaluated for morphological changes, apoptosis, proliferation and choline metabolism. Maternal MTHFR deficiency resulted in short-term memory impairment in offspring. These dams had elevated levels of plasma homocysteine when compared with wild-type dams. There were no differences in plasma homocysteine in offspring. Increased apoptosis and proliferation was observed in the hippocampus of offspring from Mthfr+/− mothers. In the maternal FD and ChDD study, offspring also showed short-term memory impairment with increased apoptosis in the hippocampus; increased neurogenesis was observed in ChDD offspring. Choline acetyltransferase protein was increased in the offspring hippocampus of both dietary groups and betaine was decreased in the hippocampus of FD offspring. Our results reveal short-term memory deficits in the offspring of dams with MTHFR deficiency or dietary deficiencies of critical methyl donors. We suggest that deficiencies in maternal one-carbon metabolism during pregnancy can contribute to hippocampal dysfunction in offspring through apoptosis or altered choline metabolism.

AB  - Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) that disrupts input from higher brain centers to the lumbar region of the spinal cord results in paraplegia, one of the most debilitating conditions affecting locomotion. Non-human primates have long been considered to be the most appropriate animal to model lower limb dysfunction. More recently, however, there has been a wealth of scientific information gathered in the rat regarding the central control of locomotion. Moreover, rodent models of SCI at lumbar levels have been widely used to validate therapeutic scenarios aimed at the restoration of locomotor activities. Despite the growing use of the rat as a model of locomotor dysfunction, knowledge regarding the anatomical relationship between spinal cord motor neurons and the hindlimb muscles that they innervate is incomplete. Previous studies performed in our laboratory have shown the details of the muscle/motor neuron topographical relationship for the mouse forelimb and hindlimb as well as for the rat forelimb. The present analysis aims to characterize the segmental distribution of the motor neuron pools that innervate the muscles of the rat hindlimb, hence completing this series of studies. The location of the motor end plate (MEP) regions on the main muscles of the rat hindlimb was first revealed with acetylcholinesterase histochemistry. For each muscle under scrutiny, injections of Fluoro-Gold were then performed along the length of the MEP region. Targeting the MEPs gave rise to columns of motor neurons that span more spinal cord segments than previously reported. The importance of this study is discussed in terms of its application to gene therapy for SCI.

AB  - Abstract
Prenatal morphine exposure throughout pregnancy can induce a series of neurobehavioral and neurochemical disturbances by affecting central nervous system development. This study was designed to investigate the effects of an enriched environment on behavioral deficits and changes in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels induced by prenatal morphine in rats. On pregnancy days 11–18, female Wistar rats were randomly injected twice daily with saline or morphine. Offspring were weaned on postnatal day (PND) 21. They were subjected to a standard rearing environment or an enriched environment on PNDs 22–50. On PNDs 51–57, the behavioral responses including anxiety and depression-like behaviors, and passive avoidance memory as well as hippocampal BDNF levels were investigated. The light/dark (L/D) box and elevated plus maze (EPM) were used for the study of anxiety, forced swimming test (FST) was used to assess depression-like behavior and passive avoidance task was used to evaluate learning and memory. Prenatal morphine exposure caused a reduction in time spent in the EPM open arms and a reduction in time spent in the lit side of the L/D box. It also decreased step-through latency and increased time spent in the dark side of passive avoidance task. Prenatal morphine exposure also reduced immobility time and increased swimming time in FST. Postnatal rearing in an enriched environment counteracted with behavioral deficits in the EPM and passive avoidance task, but not in the L/D box. This suggests that exposure to an enriched environment during adolescence period alters anxiety profile in a task-specific manner. Prenatal morphine exposure reduced hippocampal BDNF levels, but enriched environment significantly increased BDNF levels in both saline- and morphine-exposed groups. Our results demonstrate that exposure to an enriched environment alleviates behavioral deficits induced by prenatal morphine exposure and up-regulates the decreased levels of BDNF. BDNF may contribute to the beneficial effects of an enriched environment on prenatal morphine-exposed to rats.

AB  - Abstract
Adolescent females are particularly vulnerable to mental illnesses with co-morbidity of anxiety, such as anorexia nervosa (AN). We used an animal model of AN, called activity-based anorexia (ABA), to investigate the neurobiological basis of vulnerability to repeated, food restriction (FR) stress-evoked anxiety. Twenty-one of 23 adolescent female mice responded to the 1st FR with increased wheel-running activity (WRA), even during the limited period of food access, thereby capturing AN’s symptoms of voluntary FR and over-exercise. Baseline WRA was an excellent predictor of FR-elicited WRA (severity of ABA, SOA), with high baseline runners responding to FR with minimal SOA (i.e., negative correlation). Nine gained resistance to ABA following the 1st FR. Even though allopregnanolone (3α-OH-5α-pregnan-20-one, THP), the metabolite of progesterone (P4), is a well-recognized anxiolytic agent, subcutaneous P4 to these ABA-resistant animals during the 2nd FR was exacerbative, evoking greater WRA than the counterpart resistant group that received oil vehicle, only. Moreover, P4 had no WRA-reducing effect on animals that remained ABA-vulnerable. To explain the sensitizing effect of P4 upon the resistant mice, we examined the relationship between P4 treatment and levels of the α4 subunit of GABAARs at spines of pyramidal cells of the hippocampal CA1, a parameter previously shown to correlate with resistance to ABA. α4 levels at spine membrane correlated strongly and negatively with SOA during the 1st ABA (prior to P4 injection), confirming previous findings. α4 levels were greater among P4-treated animals that had gained resistance than of vehicle-treated resistant animals or of the vulnerable animals with or without P4. We propose that α4-GABAARs play a protective role by counterbalancing the ABA-induced increase in excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons, and although exogenous P4’s metabolite, THP, enhances α4 expression, especially among those that can gain resistance, it also interferes with α4-GABAARs’ protective role by desensitizing α4-GABAARs.

AB  - Abstract
The neural command required to coordinate a multi-joint movement is inherently complex. During multi-joint movement of the limb, the force created from movement at one joint may create a torque at a second joint known as an interaction torque. Interaction torques may be assistive or resistive thereby aiding or opposing the motion of the second joint, respectively. For movement to be effectively controlled, the central nervous system should modulate neural output to the muscles to appropriately account for interaction torques. The present study examined the neural output from the primary motor cortex before and during reaching movements that required different combinations of assistive and resistive interaction torques occurring at the shoulder and elbow joints. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation to probe neural output from the primary motor cortex, results indicate that corticospinal output controlling the upper arm is related to resistive interaction torques occurring at the shoulder joint. Further, cortical output to bi-articular muscles is associated with interaction torque and this may be driven by the fact that these muscles are in an advantageous position to control torques produced between inter-connection segments. Humans have a tendency to avoid reaching movements that involve resistive interaction torques and this may be driven by the requirement of increased neural output associated with these movements.

AB  - Abstract
For over two decades it has been increasingly appreciated that synaptic plasticity mechanisms are subject to activity-dependent metaplastic regulation. In recent years it has also become apparent that astrocytes are active partners with neurons at synapses, and have the capability to powerfully regulate synaptic plasticity. However, the field of astrocyte-mediated metaplasticity is still very much in its infancy. Further, what contribution astrocyte-mediated metaplasticity makes to hippocampal dysfunction is almost entirely unknown. This contribution may be particularly important given that altered plasticity in the hippocampus is a hallmark of several disease states. The known ways by which astrocytes exert metaplasticity are reviewed here, and hypothetical mechanisms of astrocyte-mediated metaplasticity are considered for the benefit of future investigation. The latter half of this review focuses on what part these mechanisms, and others, may play in the diseased or injured hippocampus, and how this might contribute to the altered cognition seen in several pathologies common to the hippocampus.

AB  - Abstract
Electrophysiological studies demonstrate that the neural coding of pitch is modulated by language experience and the linguistic relevance of the auditory input; both rightward and leftward asymmetries have been observed in the hemispheric specialization for pitch. In music, pitch is encoded using two primary features: contour (patterns of rises and falls) and interval (frequency separation between tones) cues. Recent evoked potential studies demonstrate that these “global” (contour) and “local” (interval) aspects of pitch are processed automatically (but bilaterally) in trained musicians. Here, we examined whether alternate forms of pitch expertise, namely, tone-language experience (i.e., Chinese), influence the early detection of contour and intervallic deviations within ongoing pitch sequences. Neuroelectric mismatch negativity (MMN) potentials were recorded in Chinese speakers and English-speaking nonmusicians in response to continuous pitch sequences with occasional global or local deviations in the ongoing melodic stream. This paradigm allowed us to explore potential cross-language differences in the hemispheric weighting for contour and interval processing of pitch. Chinese speakers showed differential pitch encoding between hemispheres not observed in English listeners; Chinese MMNs revealed a rightward bias for contour processing but a leftward hemispheric laterality for interval processing. In contrast, no asymmetries were observed in the English group. Collectively, our findings suggest tone-language experience sensitizes auditory brain mechanisms for the detection of subtle global/local pitch changes in the ongoing auditory stream and exaggerates functional asymmetries in pitch processing between cerebral hemispheres.

AB  - Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common type of dementia among older people. The number of patients with AD will grow rapidly each year and AD is the fifth leading cause of death for those aged 65 and older. In recent years, one of the main challenges for medical investigators has been the early diagnosis of patients with AD because an early diagnosis can provide greater opportunities for patients to be eligible for more clinical trials and they will have enough time to plan for future, medical and financial decisions. An established risk factor for AD is mild cognitive impairment (MCI) which is described as a transitional state between normal aging and AD patients. Hence an accurate and reliable diagnosis of MCI can be very effective and helpful for early diagnosis of AD. Therefore in this paper we present a novel and efficient method based on pseudo Zernike moments (PZMs) for the diagnosis of MCI individuals from AD and healthy control (HC) groups using structural MRI. The proposed method uses PZMs to extract discriminative information from the MR images of the AD, MCI, and HC groups. Two types of artificial neural networks, which are based on pattern recognition and learning vector quantization (LVQ) networks, were used to classify the information extracted from the MRIs. We worked with 500 MRIs from the database of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI 1 1.5T). The 1 slice of 500 MRIs used in this study included 180 AD patients, 172 MCI patients, and 148 HC individuals. We selected 50 percent of the MRIs randomly for use in training the classifiers, 25 percent for validation and we used 25 percent for the testing phase. The technique proposed here yielded the best overall classification results between AD and MCI (accuracy 94.88%, sensitivity 94.18%, and specificity 95.55%), and for pairs of the MCI and HC (accuracy 95.59%, sensitivity 95.89% and specificity 95.34%). These results were achieved using maximum order 30 of PZM and the pattern recognition network with the scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) back-propagation training algorithm as a classifier.

AB  - Abstract
We investigated the role of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) activated during preconditioning low-frequency stimulation (LFS) in the subsequent high-frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 neurons in hippocampal slices from mature guinea pigs. Induction of LTP in the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) or the population spike (PS) by delivery of HFS (a tetanus of 100 pulses at 100 Hz) to the Schaffer collateral–commissural pathway to CA1 neuron synapses was suppressed when the CA1 synapses were preconditioned by LFS of 1000 pulses at 1 Hz. This effect was inhibited when the preconditioning LFS was applied in the presence of an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) antagonist, a metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) antagonist, IP3R antagonist, a calmodulin-dependent kinase II inhibitor or a calcineurin inhibitor. Furthermore, blockade of group I mGluRs immediately before the delivery of HFS blocked the inhibitory effect of the preconditioning LFS on subsequent induction of LTP by HFS. These results suggest that, in hippocampal CA1 neuron synapses, co-activation of NMDARs and IP3Rs during a preconditioning LFS results in both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events that lead to prolonged activation of group I mGluRs that is responsible for the failure of LTP induction.

AB  - Abstract
Allopregnanolone (APα; 5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one) is synthesized in both the periphery and central nervous system and is known to be a potent positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor. Because APα was suggested to improve the symptoms of depression and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which involve synaptic dysfunction and loss, we examined whether APα affects excitatory synapses. Drebrin, which is an actin-binding protein, forms a unique stable actin structure in dendritic spines, and drebrin levels correlate positively with cognitive levels in AD and mild cognitive impairment. We investigated whether APα increases excitatory synapse density along dendrites of mature hippocampal neurons using drebrin-imaging-based evaluation of mature synapses. We prepared primary cultures of hippocampal neurons and either transfected them with GFP or immunostained them against drebrin. Morphological analysis of GFP-transfected neurons revealed that a 24-h exposure to 0.3 or 1 μM APα significantly increased dendritic spine density without any morphological changes to spines. Drebrin cluster density was also increased by 0.3 and 1 μM APα. The protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89 inhibited the APα-induced increase in drebrin cluster density. These data demonstrate that APα increases mature excitatory synapses via activation of PKA. Therefore, the PKA-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling pathway is likely to be involved in the APα-induced increase of mature excitatory synapses. Another possibility is that the PKA-dependent increase in AMPA receptors at dendritic spines mediates the APα function. In conclusion, our study indicates that APα may improve neuropsychiatric disorder outcomes via increasing the numbers of mature excitatory synapses.

AB  - Abstract
Clinical and animal studies indicate that maternal consumption of ethanol during pregnancy increases alcohol drinking in the offspring. Possible underlying mechanisms may involve orexigenic peptides, which are stimulated by prenatal ethanol exposure and themselves promote drinking. Building on evidence that ethanol stimulates neuroimmune factors such as the chemokine CCL2 that in adult rats is shown to colocalize with the orexigenic peptide, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), the present study sought to investigate the possibility that CCL2 or its receptor CCR2 in LH is stimulated by prenatal ethanol exposure, perhaps specifically within MCH neurons. Our paradigm of intraoral administration of ethanol to pregnant rats, at low-to-moderate doses (1 or 3 g/kg/day) during peak hypothalamic neurogenesis, caused in adolescent male offspring twofold increase in drinking of and preference for ethanol and reinstatement of ethanol drinking in a two-bottle choice paradigm under an intermittent access schedule. This effect of prenatal ethanol exposure was associated with an increased expression of MCH and density of MCH+ neurons in LH of preadolescent offspring. Whereas CCL2+ cells at this age were low in density and unaffected by ethanol, CCR2+ cells were dense in LH and increased by prenatal ethanol, with a large percentage (83–87%) identified as neurons and found to colocalize MCH. Prenatal ethanol also stimulated the genesis of CCR2+ and MCH+ neurons in the embryo, which co-labeled the proliferation marker, BrdU. Ethanol also increased the genesis and density of neurons that co-expressed CCR2 and MCH in LH, with triple-labeled CCR2+/MCH+/BrdU+ neurons that were absent in control rats accounting for 35% of newly generated neurons in ethanol-exposed rats. With both the chemokine and MCH systems believed to promote ethanol consumption, this greater density of CCR2+/MCH+ neurons in the LH of preadolescent rats suggests that these systems function together in promoting alcohol drinking during adolescence.

AB  - Abstract
Right hemisphere dominance for visuo-spatial attention is characteristically observed in most right-handed individuals. This dominance has been attributed to both an anatomically larger right fronto-parietal network and the existence of asymmetric parietal interhemispheric connections. Previously it has been demonstrated that interhemispheric conflict, which induces left hemisphere inhibition, results in the modulation of both (i) the excitability of the early visual cortex (V1) and (ii) the brainstem-mediated vestibular–ocular reflex (VOR) via top-down control mechanisms. However to date, it remains unknown whether the degree of an individual’s right hemisphere dominance for visuospatial function can influence, (i) the baseline excitability of the visual cortex and (ii) the extent to which the right hemisphere can exert top-down modulation. We directly tested this by correlating line bisection error (or pseudoneglect), taken as a measure of right hemisphere dominance, with both (i) visual cortical excitability measured using phosphene perception elicited via single-pulse occipital trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and (ii) the degree of trans-cranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)-mediated VOR suppression, following left hemisphere inhibition. We found that those individuals with greater right hemisphere dominance had a less excitable early visual cortex at baseline and demonstrated a greater degree of vestibular nystagmus suppression following left hemisphere cathodal tDCS. To conclude, our results provide the first demonstration that individual differences in right hemisphere dominance can directly predict both the baseline excitability of low-level brain structures and the degree of top-down modulation exerted over them.

AB  - Abstract
The present study attempted to investigate how chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) and repeated low-dose progesterone (P) treatment affect gene and protein expression, subcellular distribution of key apoptotic elements within protein kinase B (Akt) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (Erk) signal transduction pathways, as well as neurodegenerative processes and behavior. The results revealed the absence of Erk activation in CCH in cytosolic and synaptosomal fractions, indicating a lower threshold of Akt activation in brain ischemia, while P increased their levels above control values. CCH induced an increase in caspase 3 (Casp 3) and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) gene and protein expression. However, P restored expression of examined molecules in all observed fractions, except for the levels of Casp 3 in synapses which highlighted its possible non-apoptotic or even protective function. Our study showed the absence of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells (NF-κB) response to this type of ischemic condition and its strong activation under the influence of P. Further, the initial increase in the number of apoptotic cells and amount of DNA fragmentation induced by CCH was significantly reduced by P. Finally, P reversed the CCH-induced reduction in locomotor activity, while promoting a substantial decrease in anxiety-related behavior. Our findings support the concept that repeated low-dose post-ischemic P treatment reduces CCH-induced neurodegeneration in the hippocampus. Neuroprotection is initiated through the activation of investigated kinases and regulation of their downstream molecules in subcellular specific manner, indicating that this treatment may be a promising therapy for alleviation of CCH-induced pathologies.

AB  - Abstract
Huntington’s disease (HD) is a severe genetically inherited neurodegenerative disorder. Patients present with three principal phenotypes of motor symptoms: choreatic, hypokinetic-rigid and mixed. The Q175 mouse model of disease offers an opportunity to investigate the cellular basis of the hypokinetic-rigid form of HD. At the age of 1 year homozygote Q175 mice exhibited the following signs of hypokinesia: Reduced frequency of spontaneous movements on a precision balance at daytime (−55%), increased total time spent without movement in an open field (+42%), failures in the execution of unconditioned avoidance reactions (+32%), reduced ability for conditioned avoidance (−96%) and increased reaction times (+65%) in a shuttle box. Local field potential recordings revealed low-frequency gamma oscillations in the striatum as a characteristic feature of HD mice at rest. There was no significant loss of DARPP-32 immunolabeled striatal projection neurons (SPNs) although the level of DARPP-32 immunoreactivity was lower in HD. As a potential cause of hypokinesia, HD mice revealed a strong reduction in striatal KCl-induced dopamine release, accompanied by a decrease in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-(TH)- and VMAT2-positive synaptic varicosities. The presynaptic TH fluorescence level was also reduced. Patch-clamp experiments were performed in slices from 1-year-old mice to record unitary EPSCs (uEPSCs) of presumed cortical origin in the absence of G-protein-mediated modulation. In HD mice, the maximal amplitudes of uEPSCs amounted to 69% of the WT level which matches the loss of VGluT1+/SYP+ synaptic terminals in immunostained sections. These results identify impairment of cortico-striatal synaptic transmission and dopamine release as a potential basis of hypokinesia in HD.

AB  - Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, is characterized by the presence of senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss in defined regions of the brain including the hippocampus and cortex. Transplantation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) offers a safe and potentially effective tool for treating neurodegenerative disorders. However, the therapeutic effects of BM-MSCs on AD pathology remain unclear and their mechanisms at cellular and molecular levels still need to be addressed. In this study, we developed a unique neuronal culture made from 5xFAD mouse, an APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model (FAD neurons) to investigate progressive neurodegeneration associated with AD pathology and efficacy of brain-derived neurotrophic factor expressing-MSCs (BDNF-MSCs). Analyses of the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), synaptic markers and survival/apoptotic signals indicate that pathological features of cultured neurons made from these mice accurately mimic AD pathology, suggesting that our protocol provided a valid in vitro model of AD. We also demonstrated amelioration of AD pathology by MSCs in vitro when these FAD neurons were co-cultured with MSCs, a paradigm that mimics the in vivo environment of post-transplantation of MSCs into damaged regions of brains. To overcome failed delivery of BDNF to the brain and to enhance MSCs releasing BDNF effect, we created BDNF-MSCs and found that MSCs protection was enhanced by BDNF-MSCs. This protection was abolished by BDNF-blocking peptides, suggesting that BDNF supply from BDNF-MSCs was enough to prevent AD pathology.

AB  - Abstract
The hippocampus, a medial temporal lobe structure necessary for the formation of spatial memory, is particularly affected by both normal and pathologic aging. In previous studies, we observed a significant age-related increase in dopaminergic neuron loss in the hypothalamus and the substantia nigra of female rats, which becomes more conspicuous at extreme ages. Here, we extend our studies by assessing spatial memory in 4–6 month-old (young), 26-month-old (old) and 29–32-month-old (senile) Sprague–Dawley female rats as well as the age-related histopathological changes in their dorsal hippocampus. Age changes in spatial memory performance were assessed with a modified version of the Barnes maze test. We employed two probe trials (PTs), one and five days after training, respectively, in order to evaluate learning ability as well as short-term and longer-term spatial memory retention. A set of relevant hippocampal cell markers was also quantitated in the animals by means of an unbiased stereological approach. The results revealed that old rats perform better than senile rats in acquisition trials and young rats perform better than both aging groups. However, during short-term PT both aging groups showed a preserved spatial memory while in longer-term PT, spatial memory showed deterioration in both aged groups. Morphological analysis showed a marked decrease (94–97%) in doublecortin neuron number in the dentate gyrus in both aged groups and a reduction in glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cell number in the stratum radiatum of aging rats. Astroglial process length and branching complexity decreased in aged rats. We conclude that while target-seeking activity and learning ability decrease in aged females, spatial memory only declines in the longer-term tests. The reduction in neuroblast number and astroglial arborescence complexity in the dorsal hippocampus are likely to play a role in the cognitive deficits of aging rats.

AB  - Abstract
Adolescence is often portrayed as a period of enhanced sensitivity to reward, with long-lasting neurobiological changes upon reward exposure. However, we previously found that time-dependent increases in cue-induced sucrose seeking were more pronounced in rats trained to self-administer sucrose as adults than as adolescents. In addition, adult, but not adolescent sucrose self-administration led to a decreased α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid/N-Methyl-D-aspartate (AMPA/NMDA) ratio in the nucleus accumbens core, suggesting that long-lasting changes in glutamatergic transmission may affect adult processing of natural rewards. Here we tested whether altering glutamatergic transmission in the nucleus accumbens core via local injection of an mGluR2/3 agonist and antagonist affects cue-induced sucrose seeking following abstinence and whether this is different in the two age groups.

Rats began oral sucrose self-administration training (10 days) on postnatal day (P) 35 (adolescents) or P70 (adults). Following 21 days of abstinence, rats received microinjections of the mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 (0.3 or 1.0 μg/side) or vehicle into the nucleus accumbens core, and 15 min later cue-induced sucrose seeking was assessed. An additional group of rats trained as adults received nucleus accumbens core microinjections of the mGluR2/3 antagonist (RS)-α-Methyl-4-phosphonophenylglycine (MPPG) (0.12 or 0.5 μg/side).

Confirming our previous results, adult rats earned more sucrose reinforcers, while sucrose intake per body weight was similar across ages. On abstinence day 22, local injection of the mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 increased cue-induced sucrose seeking only in adult rats, and had no effect in adolescents. Local injections of the mGluR2/3 antagonist MPPG had no effect on sucrose seeking in adult rats. These data suggest an important developmental difference in the neural substrates of natural reward, specifically a difference in glutamatergic transmission in the accumbens in cue-induced responding for sucrose between adolescent and adult rats.

AB  - Abstract
Survivin, a unique member of the inhibitor of the apoptosis protein (IAP) family, has been suggested to play a crucial role in promoting the cell cycle and mediates mitosis during embryonic development. However, the role of survivin following traumatic brain injury (TBI) in adult neurogenesis and apoptosis in the mouse dentate gyrus (DG) remains only partially understood. We adopted adenovirus-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) as a means of suppressing the expression of survivin and observed its effects on adult regeneration and neurological function in mice after brain injury. The mice were subjected to TBI, and the ipsilateral hippocampus was then examined using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting analyses. Brain slices were stained for 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and doublecortin (DCX). Our data showed that survivin knockdown inhibits the proliferation and differentiation of neural precursor cells (NPCs) in the DG of the hippocampus soon after TBI. Furthermore, downregulation of survivin results in a significant increase in programmed cell death in the DG, as assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) double staining. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was adopted to evaluate neurological function, which confirmed that knockdown of survivin worsened the memory capacity that was already compromised following TBI. Survivin in adult mice brains after TBI can be successfully down-regulated by RNAi, which inhibited adult hippocampal neurogenesis, promoted apoptotic cell death, and resulted in a negative role in the recovery of dysfunction following injury.

AB  - Abstract
Acute bouts of aerobic physical exercise can modulate subsequent cognitive task performance and oscillatory brain activity measured with electroencephalography (EEG). Here, we investigated the sequencing of these modulations of perceptual and cognitive processes using scalp recorded EEG acquired during exercise. Twelve participants viewed pseudo-random sequences of frequent non-target stimuli (cars), infrequent distractors (obliquely oriented faces) and infrequent targets that required a simple detection response (obliquely oriented faces, where the angle was different than the infrequent distractors). The sequences were presented while seated on a stationary bike under three conditions during which scalp recorded EEG was also acquired: rest, low-intensity exercise, and high-intensity exercise. Behavioral target detection was faster during high-intensity exercise compared to both rest and low-intensity exercise. An event-related potential (ERP) analysis of the EEG data revealed that the mean amplitude of the visual P1 component evoked by frequent non-targets measured at parietal–occipital electrodes was larger during low-intensity exercise compared to rest. The P1 component evoked by infrequent targets also peaked earlier during low-intensity exercise compared to rest and high-intensity exercise. The P3a ERP component evoked by infrequent distractors measured at parietal electrodes peaked significantly earlier during both low- and high-intensity exercise when compared to rest. The modulation of the visual P1 and the later P3a components is consistent with the conclusion that exercise modulates multiple stages of neural information processing, ranging from early stage sensory processing (P1) to post-perceptual target categorization (P3a).

AB  - Abstract
Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) decodes neuronal activity by translating cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals into kinase activity that regulates neuronal functions including excitability, gene expression, and synaptic transmission. Four genes lead to developmental and differential expression of CaMKII isoforms (α, β, γ, δ). We determined mRNA levels of these isoforms in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of adult rats with and without nerve injury in order to determine if differential expression of CaMKII isoforms may contribute to functional differences that follow injury. DRG neurons express mRNA for all four isoforms, and the relative abundance of CaMKII isoforms was γ &gt; α &gt; β = δ, based on the CT values. Following ligation of the 5th lumbar (L5) spinal nerve (SNL), the β isoform did not change, but mRNA levels of both the γ and α isoforms were reduced in the directly injured L5 neurons, and the α isoform was reduced in L4 neurons, compared to their contemporary controls. In contrast, expression of the δ isoform mRNA increased in L5 neurons. CaMKII protein decreased following nerve injury in both L4 and L5 populations. Total CaMKII activity measured under saturating Ca2+/CaM conditions was decreased in both L4 and L5 populations, while autonomous CaMKII activity determined in the absence of Ca2+ was selectively reduced in axotomized L5 neurons 21 days after injury. Thus, loss of CaMKII signaling in sensory neurons after peripheral nerve injury may contribute to neuronal dysfunction and pain.

Long-lasting microiontophoretic applications of the amine induced a significant and reversible depression of the responsiveness of RN neurons to Glu. This effect was mediated by noradrenergic alpha2 receptors since it was mimicked by application of clonidine, an alpha2 adrenoceptor agonist, and blocked or at least reduced by application of yohimbine, an antagonist of NA for the same receptors. The effect appears homogeneously throughout the nucleus and is independent of the effect of NA on baseline firing rate. Application of isoproterenol, a beta adrenoceptor agonist, either enhanced or depressed neuronal responses to Glu in a high percentage (86%) of the tested neurons. Moreover, application of timolol, a beta adrenoceptor antagonist, was able to strengthen the depressive effects induced by NA application on neuronal responsiveness to Glu.

Although these data suggest some involvement of beta adrenergic receptors in the modulation of neuronal responsiveness to Glu, the overall results indicate a short-term depressive action of NA, mediated by alpha2 receptors, on the responsiveness of RN neurons and suggest that stress initially leads to an attenuation of the relay function of the RN.

AB  - Abstract
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive inflammatory autoimmune disease that is characterized by demyelination and axonal damage in the nervous system. One obvious consequence is a cumulative loss of muscle control. However, cognitive dysfunction affects roughly half of MS sufferers, sometimes already early in the disease course. Although long-term (remote) memory is typically unaffected, the ability to form new declarative memories becomes compromised. A major structure for the encoding of new declarative memories is the hippocampus. Encoding is believed to be mediated by synaptic plasticity in the form of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic strength. Here, in an animal model of MS we explored whether disease symptoms are accompanied by a loss of functional neuronal integrity, synaptic plasticity, or hippocampus-dependent learning ability. In mice that developed MOG35–55-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), passive properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons were unaffected, although the ability to fire action potentials became reduced in the late phase of EAE. LTP remained normal in the early phase of MOG35–55-induced EAE. However, in the late phase, LTP was impaired and LTP-related spatial memory was impaired. In contrast, LTD and hippocampus-dependent object recognition memory were unaffected. These data suggest that in an animal model of MS hippocampal function becomes compromised as the disease progresses.

AB  - Abstract
The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) participates in the behavioral flexibility. As a major downstream molecule in the NMDA receptor signaling, alpha-Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (αCaMKII) is crucial for hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and hippocampus-related memory. However, the role of αCaMKII in mPFC-related behavioral flexibility and mPFC synaptic plasticity remains elusive. In the present study, using chemical-genetic approaches to temporally up-regulate αCaMKII activity, we found that αCaMKII-F89G transgenic mice exhibited impaired behavioral flexibility in Y-water maze arm reversal task. Notably, in vitro electrophysiological analysis showed normal basal synaptic transmission, LTP and depotentiation, but selectively impaired NMDAR-dependent long-term depression (LTD) in the mPFC of αCaMKII-F89G transgenic mice. In accordance with the deficit in NMDAR-dependent LTD, αCaMKII-F89G transgenic mice exhibited impaired AMPAR internalization during NMDAR-dependent chemical LTD expression in the mPFC. Furthermore, the above deficits in behavioral flexibility, NMDAR-dependent LTD and AMPAR internalization could all be reversed by 1-naphthylmethyl (NM)-PP1, a specific inhibitor of exogenous αCaMKII-F89G activity. Taken together, our results for the first time indicate that αCaMKII overexpression in the forebrain impairs behavioral flexibility and NMDAR-dependent LTD in the mPFC, and supports the notion that there is a close relationship between NMDAR-dependent LTD and behavioral flexibility.

Transient receptor potential canonical channel-6 (TRPC6) forms Ca2+-permeable non-selective cation channels in neurons. Although TRPC6 plays an important role in neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival during development, TRPC6 expression profiles available to identify distinctive hippocampal neuronal damage and hippocampal excitability in epilepsy are less defined. As compared to normal animals, TRPC6 expression was down-regulated in chronic epileptic rats showing spontaneous recurrent seizures. TRPC6 knockdown increased seizure susceptibility, excitability ratio and paired-pulse inhibition in the dentate gyrus (DG) of normal animals. Furthermore, TRPC6 knockdown promoted programed neuronal necrosis in dentate granule cells, but prevented it in CA1 and CA3 neurons following status epilepticus. The present data suggest for the first time that TRPC6 may inhibit seizure susceptibility and neuronal vulnerability in the rat DG.

AB  - Abstract
14-3-3s are a highly conserved protein family that plays important roles in cell survival and interact with several proteins implicated in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Disruption of 14-3-3 expression and function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. We have previously shown that increasing the expression level of 14-3-3θ is protective against rotenone and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) in cultured cells. Here, we extend our studies to examine the effects of 14-3-3s in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. We first investigated whether targeted nigral 14-3-3θ overexpression mediated by adeno-associated virus offers neuroprotection against MPTP-induced toxicity. 14-3-3θ overexpression using this approach did not reduce MPTP-induced dopaminergic cell loss in the substantia nigra nor the depletion of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites in the striatum at three weeks after MPTP administration. However, 14-3-3θ-overexpressing mice showed a later partial recovery in striatal DA metabolites at eight weeks after MPTP administration compared to controls, suggesting that 14-3-3θ overexpression may help in the functional recovery of those dopaminergic neurons that survive. Conversely, we investigated whether disrupting 14-3-3 function in transgenic mice expressing the pan 14-3-3 inhibitor difopein exacerbates MPTP-induced toxicity. We found that difopein expression promoted dopaminergic cell loss in response to MPTP treatment. Together, these findings suggest that 14-3-3θ overexpression promotes recovery of DA metabolites whereas 14-3-3 inhibition exacerbates neuron loss in the MPTP mouse model of PD.

AB  - Abstract
Previous findings indicate that post-training administration of glucocorticoid stress hormones can interact with the noradrenergic system to enhance consolidation of hippocampus- or amygdala-dependent cognitive/emotional memory. The present experiments were designed to extend these findings by examining the potential interaction of glucocorticoid and noradrenergic mechanisms in enhancement of dorsolateral striatum (DLS)-dependent habit memory. In experiment 1, different groups of adult male Long–Evans rats received training in two DLS-dependent memory tasks. In a cued water maze task, rats were released from various start points and were reinforced to approach a visibly cued escape platform. In a response-learning version of the water plus-maze task, animals were released from opposite starting positions and were reinforced to make a consistent egocentric body-turn to reach a hidden escape platform. Immediately post-training, rats received peripheral injections of the glucocorticoid corticosterone (1 or 3 mg/kg) or vehicle solution. In both tasks, corticosterone (3 mg/kg) enhanced DLS-dependent habit memory. In experiment 2, a separate group of animals received training in the response learning version of the water plus-maze task and were given peripheral post-training injections of corticosterone (3 mg/kg), the β-adrenoreceptor antagonist propranolol (3 mg/kg), corticosterone and propranolol concurrently, or control vehicle solution. Corticosterone injections again enhanced DLS-dependent memory, and this effect was blocked by concurrent administration of propranolol. Propranolol administration by itself (3 mg/kg) did not influence DLS-dependent memory. Taken together, the findings indicate an interaction between glucocorticoid and noradrenergic mechanisms in DLS-dependent habit memory. Propranolol administration may be useful in treating stress-related human psychopathologies associated with a dysfunctional DLS-dependent habit memory system.

AB  - Abstract
Complete spinal transection in adult rats results in poor recovery of hind limb function, whereas significant spontaneous recovery can occur following spinal cord transection in rat neonates. The mechanisms underlying the recovery, however, are poorly understood. Recent studies in rodents suggested that the recovery is not due to axonal regeneration, but rather due to reorganization of the neural circuits in the spinal cord below the injury site, including central pattern generators. Few studies have reported histological evidence for changes in the primary sensory fibers or terminals. Thus, in the present study, we transected spinal cords of rats at thoracic level 8 at postnatal day 5. Four weeks after the injury, biotinylated-dextran amine (BDA), an anterograde tracer, was injected into the dorsal root ganglion of the lumbar spinal cord to examine the localization of sensory fibers and their terminal buttons in the spinal cord. BDA-positive axons in the rat spinal cord following neonatal spinal transection (neo ST) were longer than those in sham-operated or normal rats. The number of terminal buttons was also higher in spinal cords of neo ST rats compared with sham-operated or normal rats. These findings suggest that sensory fibers project more strongly and make more synapses following neo ST to compensate for the lack of supraspinal projections.

AB  - Abstract
Aim: Strength training of one limb results in a substantial increase in the strength of the untrained limb, however, it remains unknown what the corticospinal responses are following either eccentric or concentric strength training and how this relates to the cross-education of strength. The aim of this study was to determine if eccentric or concentric unilateral strength training differentially modulates corticospinal excitability, inhibition and the cross-transfer of strength. Methods: Changes in contralateral (left limb) concentric strength, eccentric strength, motor-evoked potentials, short-interval intracortical inhibition and silent period durations were analyzed in groups of young adults who exercised the right wrist flexors with either eccentric (N = 9) or concentric (N = 9) contractions for 12 sessions over 4 weeks. Control subjects (N = 9) did not train. Results: Following training, both groups exhibited a significant strength gain in the trained limb (concentric group increased concentric strength by 64% and eccentric group increased eccentric strength by 62%) and the extent of the cross-transfer of strength was 28% and 47% for the concentric and eccentric group, respectively, which was different between groups (P = 0.031). Transcranial magnetic stimulation revealed that eccentric training reduced intracortical inhibition (37%), silent period duration (15–27%) and increased corticospinal excitability (51%) compared to concentric training for the untrained limb (P = 0.033). There was no change in the control group. Conclusion: The results show that eccentric training uniquely modulates corticospinal excitability and inhibition of the untrained limb to a greater extent than concentric training. These findings suggest that unilateral eccentric contractions provide a greater stimulus in cross-education paradigms and should be an integral part of the rehabilitative process following unilateral injury to maximize the response.

AB  - Abstract
Given that adolescence represents a critical moment for shaping adult behavior and may predispose to disease vulnerability later in life, the aim of this study was to find a vulnerable period during adolescence in which hippocampal cell fate regulation was altered by cocaine exposure, and to evaluate the long-term consequences of a cocaine experience during adolescence in affecting hippocampal plasticity and behavioral despair in adulthood. Study I: Male rats were treated with cocaine (15 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline for 7 consecutive days during adolescence (early post-natal day (PND) 33–39, mid PND 40–46, late PND 47–53). Hippocampal plasticity (i.e., cell fate regulation, cell genesis) was evaluated 24 h after the last treatment dose during the course of adolescence (PND 40, PND 47, PND 54). Study II: The consequences of cocaine exposure during adolescence (PND 33–39 or PND 33–46; 7 or 14 days) were measured in adulthood at the behavioral (i.e., forced swim test, PND 62–63) and molecular (hippocampal cell markers, PND 64) levels. Chronic cocaine during early adolescence dysregulated FADD forms only in the hippocampus (HC), as compared to other brain regions, and during mid adolescence, impaired cell proliferation (Ki-67) and increased PARP-1 cleavage (a cell death maker) in the HC. Interestingly, chronic cocaine exposure during adolescence did not alter the time adult rats spent immobile in the forced swim test. These results suggest that this paradigm of chronic cocaine administration during adolescence did not contribute to the later manifestation of behavioral despair (i.e., one pro-depressive symptom) as measured by the forced swim test in adulthood.

Our previous studies have suggested that surgical lesions of the rat cochlea induce cell proliferation in the cochlear nucleus (CN) that may be related to neurogenesis. The aim of the present study was to further investigate the nature of cell proliferation in the CN, following acoustic trauma that has previously been shown to induce tinnitus in rats. Rats were subjected either to a unilateral acoustic trauma (16-kHz pure tone, 115 dB for 1 h under anesthesia) or a sham procedure. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) immunohistochemistry was used to measure cell proliferation and newborn cell survival; an antibody to interleukin-6 was used to investigate inflammatory responses; and double immunolabeling for BrdU and Ki-67, BrdU and CD-11b, and BrdU and doublecortin (DCX), was used to investigate the origin of the proliferating cells. There was a time-dependent increase in the number of BrdU+ve cells in the CN following acoustic trauma; however, the number of BrdU+ve cells that survived was comparable to that of control animals at 4 weeks post-trauma. Cell proliferation was unlikely to be due to proliferating inflammatory cells as a result of a trauma-induced inflammatory response as the IL-6 expression level was comparable between sham and exposed groups. Immunolabeling revealed the BrdU+ve cells to co-express Ki-67 and DCX, but not CD-11b. However, there was no difference in DCX expression between sham and exposed animals. The results suggest that DCX-expressing cells in the CN may proliferate in response to acoustic trauma; however, the proportion of cells proliferating and the survival rate of the newborn cells may not support functional neurogenesis in the CN.

AB  - Abstract
Clinical studies suggest that obesity and Type 2 (insulin-resistant) diabetes impair the structural integrity of medial temporal lobe regions involved in memory and confer greater vulnerability to neurological insults. While eliminating obesity and its endocrine comorbidities would be the most straightforward way to minimize cognitive risk, structural barriers to physical activity and the widespread availability of calorically dense, highly palatable foods will likely necessitate additional strategies to maintain brain health over the lifespan. Research in rodents has identified numerous correlates of hippocampal functional impairment in obesity and diabetes, with several studies demonstrating causality in subsequent mechanistic studies. This review highlights recent work on pathways and cell–cell interactions underlying the synaptic consequences of obesity, diabetes, or in models with both pathological conditions. Although the mechanisms vary across different animal models, immune activation has emerged as a shared feature of obesity and diabetes, with synergistic exacerbation of neuroinflammation in model systems with both conditions. This review discusses these findings with reference to the benefits of incorporating existing models from the fields of obesity and metabolic disease. Many transgenic lines with basal metabolic alterations or differential susceptibility to diet-induced obesity have yet to be characterized with respect to their cognitive and synaptic phenotype. Adopting these models, and building on the extensive knowledge base used to generate them, is a promising avenue for understanding interactions between peripheral disease states and neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Aim: A single session of skill or strength training can modulate the primary motor cortex (M1), which manifests as increased corticospinal excitability (CSE) and decreased short-latency intra-cortical inhibition (SICI). We tested the hypothesis that both skill and strength training can propagate the neural mechanisms mediating cross-transfer and modulate the ipsilateral M1 (iM1). Methods: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measured baseline CSE and SICI in the contralateral motor cortex (cM1) and iM1. Participants completed 4 sets of unilateral training with their dominant arm, either visuomotor tracking, metronome-paced strength training (MPST), self-paced strength training (SPST) or control. Immediately post training, TMS was repeated in both M1s. Results: Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) increased and inhibition was reduced for skill and MPST training from baseline in both M1s. Self-paced strength training and control did not produce changes in CSE and SICI when compared to baseline in both M1s. After training, skill and MPST increased CSE and decreased SICI in cM1 compared to SPST and control. Skill and MPST training decreased SICI in iM1 compared to SPST and control post intervention; however, CSE in iM1 was not different across groups post training. Conclusion: Both skill training and MPST facilitated an increase in CSE and released SICI in iM1 and cM1 compared to baseline. Our results suggest that synchronizing to an auditory or a visual cue promotes neural adaptations within the iM1, which is thought to mediate cross transfer.

AB  - Abstract
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine–threonine protein kinase that controls protein synthesis in the nervous system. Here, we characterized the role of protein synthesis regulation due to mTOR signaling in rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) following plantar incision. The number of phosphorylated mTOR (p-mTOR)-positive neurons was increased 2–4 days after the incision. Rapamycin inhibited p-mTOR expression in the DRG and thermal hypersensitivity 3 days but not 1 day after the incision. Vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) expression was increased after the plantar incision, which was inhibited by rapamycin. These results demonstrated that tissue injury induces phosphorylation of mTOR and increased protein level of VGLUT2 in the DRG neurons. mTOR phosphorylation involves in maintenance of injury-induced thermal hypersensitivity.

AB  - Abstract
Post-weaning social isolation rearing (SI) in rodents elicits various behavioral abnormalities including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder-like behaviors. In order to obtain a better understanding of SI-induced behavioral abnormalities, we herein investigated the effects of SI on social affiliation and conditioned fear memory as well as the neuronal mechanism(s) underlying these effects. Four-week-old male mice were group-housed (GH) or socially isolated for 2–4 weeks before the experiments. The social affiliation test and fear memory conditioning were conducted at the age of 6 and 7 weeks, respectively. SI mice were systemically administered saline or test drugs 30 min before the social affiliation test and fear memory conditioning. Contextual and auditory fear memories were elucidated 1 and 4 days after fear conditioning. Social affiliation and contextual and auditory fear memories were weaker in SI mice than in GH mice. Methylphenidate (MPH), an inhibitor for dopamine transporters, ameliorated the SI-induced social affiliation deficit and the effect was attenuated by SCH23390, a D1 receptor antagonist, but not by sulpiride, a D2 receptor antagonist. On the other hand, tacrine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, had no effect on this deficit. In contrast, tacrine improved SI-induced deficits in fear memories in a manner that was reversed by the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine, while MPH had no effect on memory deficits. Neurochemical studies revealed that SI down-regulated the expression levels of the phosphorylated forms of neuro-signaling proteins, calmodulin-dependent kinase II (p-CaMKII), and cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein (p-CREB), as well as early growth response protein-1 (Egr-1) in the hippocampus. The administration of MPH or tacrine before fear conditioning had no effect on the levels of the phosphorylated forms of the neuro-signaling proteins elucidated following completion of the auditory fear memory test; however, when analyzed 30 min after the administration of the test drugs, tacrine significantly attenuated the SI-induced decrease in p-CaMKII, p-CREB, and Egr-1 in a manner reversible by scopolamine. Our results suggest that SI-induced deficits in social affiliation and conditioned fear memory were mediated by functional alterations to central dopaminergic and cholinergic systems, respectively.

AB  - Abstract
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease. The average age of onset of both sporadic and familial cases is 50–60 years of age. The presence of cytoplasmic inclusions of the RNA-binding protein TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) in the affected neurons is seen in 95% of the ALS cases, which results in TDP-43 nuclear clearance and loss of function. The Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of TDP-43 (TBPH) shares many characteristics with the human protein. Using a TDP-43 aggregation inducer previously developed in human cells, we created a transgenic fly that shows an adult locomotive defect. Phenotype onset correlates with a physiologically age-related drop of TDP-43/TBPH mRNA and protein levels, seen both in mice and flies. Artificial reduction of mRNA levels, in vivo, anticipates the locomotion defect to the larval stage. Our study links, for the first time, aggregation and the age-related, evolutionary conserved reduction of TDP-43/TBPH levels with the onset of an ALS-like locomotion defect in a Drosophila model. A similar process might trigger the human disease.

AB  - Abstract
Ambulatory instability and falls are a major source of morbidity in the elderly. Age-related loss of tendon reflexes is a major contributing factor to this morbidity, and deterioration of the afferent limb of the stretch reflex is a potential contributing factor to such age-dependent loss of tendon reflexes. To evaluate this, we assessed the number and distribution of muscle spindle afferent fibers in human sacral spinal ganglia (S1) and tibial nerve samples obtained at autopsy, using immunohistochemical staining for the α3 isoform of Na+, K+-ATPase (α3NKA), a marker of muscle spindle afferents. Across all age groups, an average of 26 ± 4% of myelinated fibers of tibial nerve and 17 ± 2% of ganglion neuronal profiles were α3NKA-positive (n = 8 per group). Subject age explained 85% of the variability in these counts. The relative frequency of α3NKA-labeled fibers/neurons starts to decline during the 5th decade of life, approaching half that of young adult values in 65-year-old subjects. At all ages, α3NKA-positive neurons were among the largest of spinal ganglia neurons. However, as compared to younger subjects, the population of α3NKA-positive neurons from advanced-age subjects showed diminished numbers of large (both moderately and strongly labeled), and medium-sized (strongly labeled) profiles. Considering the critical significance of ion transport by NKA for neuronal activity, our data suggest that functional impairment and, also, most likely atrophy and/or degeneration of muscle spindle afferents, are mechanisms underlying loss of tendon reflexes with age. The larger and more strongly α3NKA-expressing spindle afferents appear to be proportionally more vulnerable.

AB  - Abstract
The distribution of spinal primary afferent terminals labeled transganglionically with the choleratoxin B subunit (CTB) or its conjugates changes profoundly after perineural treatment with capsaicin. Injection of CTB conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into an intact nerve labels somatotopically related areas in the ipsilateral dorsal horn with the exceptions of the marginal zone and the substantia gelatinosa, whereas injection of this tracer into a capsaicin-pretreated nerve also results in massive labeling of these most superficial layers of the dorsal horn. The present study was initiated to clarify the role of C-fiber primary afferent neurons in this phenomenon. In L5 dorsal root ganglia, analysis of the size frequency distribution of neurons labeled after injection of CTB-HRP into the ipsilateral sciatic nerve treated previously with capsaicin or resiniferatoxin revealed a significant increase in the proportion of small neurons. In the spinal dorsal horn, capsaicin or resiniferatoxin pretreatment resulted in intense CTB-HRP labeling of the marginal zone and the substantia gelatinosa. Electron microscopic histochemistry disclosed a dramatic, ∼10-fold increase in the proportion of CTB-HRP-labeled unmyelinated dorsal root axons following perineural capsaicin or resiniferatoxin. The present results indicate that CTB-HRP labeling of C-fiber dorsal root ganglion neurons and their central terminals after perineural treatment with vanilloid compounds may be explained by their phenotypic switch rather than a sprouting response of thick myelinated spinal afferents which, in an intact nerve, can be labeled selectively with CTB-HRP. The findings also suggest a role for GM1 ganglioside in the modulation of nociceptor function and pain.

AB  - Abstract
In view of evidence that increased consumption of epicatechin (E) and quercetin (Q) may reduce the risk of stroke, we have measured the effects of combining E and Q on mitochondrial function and neuronal survival following oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD). Relative to mouse cortical neuron cultures pretreated (24 h) with either E or Q (0.1–10 μM), E + Q synergistically attenuated OGD-induced neuronal cell death. E, Q and E + Q (0.3 μM) increased spare respiratory capacity but only E + Q (0.3 μM) preserved this crucial parameter of neuronal mitochondrial function after OGD. These improvements were accompanied by corresponding increases in cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation and the expression of CREB-target genes that promote neuronal survival (Bcl-2) and mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1α). Consistent with these findings, E + Q (0.1 and 1.0 μM) elevated mitochondrial gene expression (MT-ND2 and MT-ATP6) to a greater extent than E or Q after OGD. Q (0.3–3.0 μM), but not E (3.0 μM), elevated cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) spikes and the mitochondrial membrane potential. Conversely, E and E + Q (0.1 and 0.3 μM), but not Q (0.1 and 0.3 μM), activated protein kinase B (Akt). Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibition with L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (1.0 μM) blocked neuroprotection by E (0.3 μM) or Q (1.0 μM). Oral administration of E + Q (75 mg/kg; once daily for 5 days) reduced hypoxic–ischemic brain injury. These findings suggest E and Q activate Akt- and Ca2+-mediated signaling pathways that converge on NOS and CREB resulting in synergistic improvements in neuronal mitochondrial performance which confer profound protection against ischemic injury.

AB  - Abstract
Glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are among the most abundant neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. Ketamine and other noncompetitive N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists are known to induce deficits in learning and the performance of cognitive tasks. The present study was designed to assess the effects of dorsal hippocampal (CA1) GABAb receptors on ketamine-induced spatial and non-spatial memory deficits with regard to the role of Ca2+ as a defining factor. Spatial and non-spatial novelty detection of male NMRI mice were investigated in a circular open-field apparatus. According to our results, the intraperitoneal injection of ketamine at its higher dose (0.1 mg/kg) impaired both spatial and non-spatial novelty detection. Moreover, the intra-CA1 injection of baclofen (a GABAb receptor agonist) at higher doses (0.02 and 0.2 μg/mouse) impaired the spatial but not non-spatial novelty detection. In addition, phaclofen (a GABAb receptor antagonist at 0.2 μg/mouse) impaired both spatial and non-spatial novelty detection. Baclofen restored and induced a modulatory effect on ketamine-induced responses in the spatial and non-spatial novelty detection task, respectively. On the contrary, phaclofen restored and induced a modulatory effect on ketamine-induced responses in the non-spatial and spatial novelty detection task, respectively. Finally, the subthreshold dose of SKF96365 (a Ca2+ channel blocker) impaired only the spatial but not non-spatial restoration effects of baclofen or phaclofen following a higher dose of ketamine. Such findings suggest that the ketamine-induced impairment of memory consolidation may occur through GABAb receptors of the CA1 neurons. Moreover, baclofen and phaclofen were shown to possibly exert their effects on the ketamine-induced spatial novelty detection deficits through Ca2+ channels.

AB  - Abstract
Several physiological processes in the CNS are regulated by the endocannabinoid system (ECS). Cannabinoid receptors (CBr) and CBr agonists have been involved in the modulation of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) activation. Glutaric (GA), 3-hydroxyglutaric (3-OHGA), methylmalonic (MMA) and propionic (PA) acids are endogenous metabolites produced and accumulated in the brain of children affected by severe organic acidemias (OAs) with neurodegeneration. Oxidative stress and excitotoxicity have been involved in the toxic pattern exerted by these organic acids. Studying the early pattern of toxicity exerted by these metabolites is crucial to explain the extent of damage that they can produce in the brain. Herein, we investigated the effects of the synthetic CBr agonist WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) on early markers of GA-, 3-OHGA-, MMA- and PA-induced toxicity in brain synaptosomes from adult (90-day-old) and adolescent (30-day-old) rats. As pre-treatment, WIN exerted protective effects on the GA- and MMA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, and prevented the reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and lipid peroxidation induced by all metabolites. Our findings support a protective and modulatory role of cannabinoids in the early toxic events elicited by toxic metabolites involved in OAs.

AB  - Abstract
Western diets are high in fat and sucrose and can influence behavior and gut microbiota. There is growing evidence that altering the microbiome can influence the brain and behavior. This study was designed to determine whether diet-induced changes in the gut microbiota could contribute to alterations in anxiety, memory or cognitive flexibility. Two-month-old, male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned high-fat (42% fat, 43% carbohydrate (CHO), high-sucrose (12% fat, 70% CHO (primarily sucrose) or normal chow (13% kcal fat, 62% CHO) diets. Fecal microbiome analysis, step-down latency, novel object and novel location tasks were performed prior to and 2 weeks after diet change. Water maze testing for long- and short-term memory and cognitive flexibility was conducted during weeks 5–6 post-diet change. Some similarities in alterations in the microbiome were seen in both the high-fat and high-sucrose diets (e.g., increased Clostridiales), as compared to the normal diet, but the percentage decreases in Bacteroidales were greater in the high-sucrose diet mice. Lactobacillales was only significantly increased in the high-sucrose diet group and Erysipelotrichales was only significantly affected by the high-fat diet. The high-sucrose diet group was significantly impaired in early development of a spatial bias for long-term memory, short-term memory and reversal training, compared to mice on normal diet. An increased focus on the former platform position was seen in both high-sucrose and high-fat groups during the reversal probe trials. There was no significant effect of diet on step-down, exploration or novel recognitions. Higher percentages of Clostridiales and lower expression of Bacteroidales in high-energy diets were related to the poorer cognitive flexibility in the reversal trials. These results suggest that changes in the microbiome may contribute to cognitive changes associated with eating a Western diet.

AB  - Abstract
Sodium-dependent high-affinity amino-acid transporters play crucial roles in terminating synaptic transmission in the central nervous system (CNS). However, there is lack of information about the mechanisms underlying the regulation of amino-acid transport by fast-acting neuromodulators, like ATP. Here, we investigated whether activation of the ATP-sensitive P2X7 receptor modulates Na+-dependent high-affinity γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate uptake into nerve terminals (synaptosomes) of the rat cerebral cortex. Radiolabeled neurotransmitter accumulation was evaluated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The cell-permeant sodium-selective fluorescent indicator, SBFI-AM, was used to estimate Na+ influx across plasma membrane. 2′(3′)-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)ATP (BzATP, 3–300 μM), a prototypic P2X7 receptor agonist, concentration-dependently decreased [3H]GABA (14%) and [14C]glutamate (24%) uptake; BzATP decreased transport maximum velocity (Vmax) without affecting the Michaelis constant (Km) values. The selective P2X7 receptor antagonist, A-438079 (3 μM), prevented inhibition of [3H]GABA and [14C]glutamate uptake by BzATP (100 μM). The inhibitory effect of BzATP coincided with its ability to increase intracellular Na+ and was mimicked by Na+ ionophores, like gramicidin and monensin. Increases in intracellular Na+ (with veratridine or ouabain) or substitution of extracellular Na+ by N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG)+ all decreased [3H]GABA and [14C]glutamate uptake and attenuated BzATP effects. Uptake inhibition by BzATP (100 μM) was also attenuated by calmidazolium, which selectively inhibits Na+ currents through the P2X7 receptor pore. In conclusion, disruption of the Na+ gradient by P2X7 receptor activation downmodulates high-affinity GABA and glutamate uptake into rat cortical synaptosomes. Interference with amino-acid transport efficacy may constitute a novel target for therapeutic management of cortical excitability.

AB  - Abstract
Inflammatory response induced by protrused nucleus pulposus (NP) has been shown to play a crucial role in the process of radicular pain. Lipoxins represent a unique class of lipid mediators that have anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving action. The present study was undertaken to investigate if intrathecal lipoxin A4 (LXA4) could alleviate mechanical allodynia in the rat models of application of NP to the L5 dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Non-compressive models of application of NP to L5 DRG were established and intrathecal catheterization for drug administration was performed in rats. Daily intrathecal injection of vehicle or LXA4 (10 ng or 100 ng) was performed for three successive days post-operation. Mechanical thresholds were tested and the ipsilateral lumbar (L4–L6) segment of spinal dorsal horns were removed for the determination of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-1β, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and IL-10 expression and NF-κB/p65, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), C-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and P38 expression. Application of NP to DRG in rats induced mechanical allodynia, increased the expression of pro-inflammatory factors (TNF-α and IL-1β), NF-κB/p65, the phosphorylated-ERK (p-ERK), -JNK (p-JNK) and -P38 (p-p38) and decreased the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-β1 and IL-10) in the ipsilateral lumbar (L4–L6) segment of spinal dorsal horns. Intrathecal injection of LXA4 alleviated the development of neuropathic pain, inhibited the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β), upregulated the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (TGF-β1 and IL-10) and attenuated the activation of NF-κB/p65, p-ERK, p-JNK, but not p-p38, in a dose-dependent manner.

In this study, we have demonstrated that LXA4 potently alleviate radicular pain in a rat model of non-compressive lumbar disc herniation. The anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution properties of LXA4 have shown a great promise for the management of radicular pain caused by intervertebral disc herniation.

AB  - Abstract
Multiple cellular systems exist to prevent uncontrolled inflammation in brain tissues; the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins have key roles in these processes. SOCS proteins are involved in restricting cellular signaling pathways by enhancing the degradation of activated receptors and removing the stimuli for continued activation. There are eight separate SOCS genes that code for proteins with similar structures and properties. All SOCS proteins can reduce signaling of activated transcription factors Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), but they also regulate many other signaling pathways. SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 have particular roles in regulating inflammatory processes. Chronic inflammation is a key feature of the pathology present in Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-affected brains resulting from responses to amyloid plaques or neurofibrillary tangles, the pathological hallmarks of AD. The goal of this study was to examine SOCS gene expression in human non-demented (ND) and AD brains and in human brain-derived microglia to determine if AD-related pathology resulted in a deficit of these critical molecules. We demonstrated that SOCS-1, SOCS-2, SOCS-3 and cytokine-inducible SH2 containing protein (CIS) mRNA expression was increased in amyloid beta peptide (Aβ)- and inflammatory-stimulated microglia, while SOCS-6 mRNA expression was decreased by both types of treatments. Using human brain samples from the temporal cortex from ND and AD cases, SOCS-1 through SOCS-7 and CIS mRNA and SOCS-1 through SOCS-7 protein could be detected constitutively in ND and AD human brain samples. Although, the expression of key SOCS genes did not change to a large extent as a result of AD pathology, there were significantly increased levels of SOCS-2, SOCS-3 and CIS mRNA and increased protein levels of SOCS-4 and SOCS-7 in AD brains. In summary, there was no evidence of a deficit of these key inflammatory regulating proteins in aged or AD brains.

AB  - Abstract
Updating the position of an earth-fixed target during whole-body rotation seems to rely on cognitive processes such as the utilization of external feedback. According to perceptual learning models, improvement in performance can also occur without external feedback. The aim of this study was to assess spatial updating improvement in the absence and in the presence of external feedback. While being rotated counterclockwise (CCW), participants had to predict when their body midline had crossed the position of a memorized target. Four experimental conditions were tested: (1) Pre-test: the target was presented 30° in the CCW direction from participant’s midline. (2) Practice: the target was located 45° in the CCW direction from participant’s midline. One group received external feedback about their spatial accuracy (Mackrous and Simoneau, 2014) while the other group did not. (3) Transfer T30CCW: the target was presented 30° in the CCW direction to evaluate whether improvement in performance, during practice, generalized to other target eccentricity. (4) Transfer T30CW: the target was presented 30° in the clockwise (CW) direction and participants were rotated CW. This transfer condition evaluated whether improvement in performance generalized to the untrained rotation direction. With practice, performance improved in the absence of external feedback (p = 0.004). Nonetheless, larger improvement occurred when external feedback was provided (ps = 0.002). During T30CCW, performance remained better for the feedback than the no-feedback group (p = 0.005). However, no group difference was observed for the untrained direction (p = 0.22). We demonstrated that spatial updating improved without external feedback but less than when external feedback was given. These observations are explained by a mixture of calibration processes and supervised vestibular learning.

AB  - Abstract
The goal of this research was to examine the effect of preconception paternal stress (PPS) on the subsequent neurodevelopment and behavior of male and female offspring. Prenatal (gestational) stress has been shown to alter brain morphology in the developing brain, and is presumed to be a factor in the development of some adult psychopathologies. Our hypothesis was that paternal stress in the preconception period could impact brain development in the offspring, leading to behavioral abnormalities later in life. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of preconception paternal stress on developing male and female offspring brain morphology in five brain areas; medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), parietal cortex (Par1), hippocampus (CA1) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Alterations in dendritic measures and spine density were observed in each brain area examined in paternal stress offspring. Our two main findings reveal; (1) PPS alters brain morphology and organization and these effects are different than the effects of stress observed at other ages; and, (2) the observed dendritic changes were sexually dimorphic. This study provides direct evidence that PPS modifies brain architecture in developing offspring, including dendritic length, cell complexity, and spine density. Alterations observed may contribute to the later development of psychopathologies and maladaptive behaviors in the offspring.

AB  - Abstract
Huntington’s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cell loss in the striatum and cerebral cortex, leading to a decline in motor control and eventually death. The mechanisms promoting motor dysfunction are not known, however loss of mitochondrial function and content has been observed, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to HD phenotype. Recent work has demonstrated that voluntary wheel running reduces hindlimb clasping in the R6/1 mouse model of HD, which we hypothesized may be due to preservation of mitochondrial content with exercise. Therefore, we investigated the role of chronic exercise training on preventing symptom progression and the loss of mitochondrial content in HD. Exercising R6/1 mice began training at 7 wks of age and continued for 10 or 20 wks. At 17 wks of age, R6/1 mice displayed a clasping phenotype without showing changes in mitochondrial respiration or protein content in either the cortex or striatum, suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction is not necessary for the progression of symptoms. At 27 wks of age, R6/1 mice demonstrated no additional changes in mitochondrial content or respiration within the cortex, but displayed loss of protein in complexes I and III of the striatum, which was not present in exercise-trained R6/1 mice. Mitochondrial respiration was also elevated in the striatum of R6/1 mice at 27 wks, which was prevented with exercise training. Together, the present study provides evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction is not necessary for the progression of hindlimb clasping in R6/1 mice, and that exercise partially prevents changes in mitochondrial content and function that occur late in HD.

AB  - Abstract
Movement dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is caused by the degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Here, we established a method for voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and automatic tissue segmentation of the marmoset monkey brain using a 7-T animal scanner and applied the method to assess DA degeneration in a PD model, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated animals, with tyrosine-hydroxylase staining. The most significant decreases of local tissue volume were detected in the bilateral SN of MPTP-treated marmoset brains (−53.0% in right and −46.5% in left) and corresponded with the location of DA neurodegeneration found in histology (−65.4% in right). In addition to the SN, the decreases were also confirmed in the locus coeruleus, and lateral hypothalamus. VBM using 7-T MRI was effective in detecting volume loss in the SN of the PD-model marmoset. This study provides a potential basis for the application of VBM with ultra-high field MRI in the clinical diagnosis of PD. The developed method may also offer value in automatic whole-brain evaluation of structural changes for the marmoset monkey.

AB  - Abstract
Synapsins (Syns) are an evolutionarily conserved family of presynaptic proteins crucial for the fine-tuning of synaptic function. A large amount of experimental evidences has shown that Syns are involved in the development of epileptic phenotypes and several mutations in Syn genes have been associated with epilepsy in humans and animal models. Syn mutations induce alterations in circuitry and neurotransmitter release, differentially affecting excitatory and inhibitory synapses, thus causing an excitation/inhibition imbalance in network excitability toward hyperexcitability that may be a determinant with regard to the development of epilepsy. Another approach to investigate epileptogenic mechanisms is to understand how silencing Syn affects the cellular behavior of single neurons and is associated with the hyperexcitable phenotypes observed in epilepsy. Here, we examined the functional effects of antisense-RNA inhibition of Syn expression on individually identified and isolated serotonergic cells of the Helix land snail. We found that Helix synapsin silencing increases cell excitability characterized by a slightly depolarized resting membrane potential, decreases the rheobase, reduces the threshold for action potential (AP) firing and increases the mean and instantaneous firing rates, with respect to control cells. The observed increase of Ca2+ and BK currents in Syn-silenced cells seems to be related to changes in the shape of the AP waveform. These currents sustain the faster spiking in Syn-deficient cells by increasing the after hyperpolarization and limiting the Na+ and Ca2+ channel inactivation during repetitive firing. This in turn speeds up the depolarization phase by reaching the AP threshold faster. Our results provide evidence that Syn silencing increases intrinsic cell excitability associated with increased Ca2+ and Ca2+-dependent BK currents in the absence of excitatory or inhibitory inputs.

AB  - Abstract
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely used to identify altered intrinsic local neural activities and global networks of tinnitus patients. In this study, functional connectivity density (FCD) mapping, a newly developed voxelwise data-driven method based on fMRI, was applied for the first time to measure the functional reorganization pattern in thirty-two unilateral pulsatile tinnitus (PT) patients in the early stage of disease (less than 48 months). FCD analysis was employed to compute short-range and long-range FCD values. A correlation analysis with clinical variables was also performed. Compared with normal controls, PT patients showed significantly increased short-range FCD, mainly in the precuneus (PCu), bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and middle occipital gyrus (MOG), and increased long-range FCD in the PCu, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG). In addition, correlation analysis showed positive correlations between PT duration and short-range FCD values in the right MOG. Positive correlations were also found between the disease duration and the long-range FCD value in the PCC. The increased short-/long-range FCD in bilateral dorsal visual areas indicated that the enhanced pathway between the auditory cortex and bilateral dorsal visual areas may have activated the “auditory occipital activations” (AOAs) pathway. The bilaterally altered FCD values in the dorsal visual areas reflected the cooperation of different brain areas. This study is a foundation of the connectivity research in PT patients. Our work may advance the understanding of the disrupted neural network of patients with PT.

AB  - Abstract
Osteoarthritis (OA) remains one of the greatest healthcare burdens in western society, with chronic debilitating pain-dominating clinical presentation yet therapeutic strategies are inadequate in many patients. Development of better analgesics is contingent on improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms mediating OA pain. Voltage-gated calcium channels 2.2 (Cav2.2) play a critical role in spinal nociceptive transmission, therefore blocking Cav2.2 activity represents an attractive opportunity for OA pain treatment, but the only available licensed Cav2.2 antagonist ziconitide (PrilatTM) is of limited use. TROX-1 is an orally available, use dependent and state-selective Cav2 antagonist, exerting its analgesic effect primarily via Cav2.2 blockade, with an improved therapeutic window compared with ziconitide. Using a rat model of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA), 2 mg, induced OA we used in vivo electrophysiology to assess the effects of spinal or systemic administration of TROX-1 on the evoked activity of wide dynamic range spinal dorsal horn neurons in response to electrical, natural mechanical (dynamic brush and von Frey 2, 8, 26 and 6 g) and thermal (40, 45 and 45 °C) stimuli applied to the peripheral receptive field.

MIA injection into the knee joint resulted in mechanical hypersensitivity of the ipsilateral hind paw and weight-bearing asymmetry. Spinal administration of TROX-1 (0.1 and 1 μg/50 μl) produced a significant dose-related inhibition of dynamic brush, mechanical (von Frey filament (vF) 8, 26 and 60 g) and noxious thermal-(45 and 48 °C) evoked neuronal responses in MIA rats only. Systemic administration of TROX-1 produced a significant inhibition of the mechanical-(vF 8, 26 and 60 g) evoked neuronal responses in MIA rats. TROX-1 did not produce any significant effect on any neuronal measure in Sham controls. Our in vivo electrophysiological results demonstrate a pathological state-dependent effect of TROX-1, which suggests an increased functional role of Cav2, likely Cav2.2, channels in mediating OA pain.

AB  - Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major risk factor for dementia. Recently, TBI has also been suggested as a risk factor for frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and plasma immunoreactivity to the TAR-DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) has been observed in both patients with acute TBI and long-term survivors of this condition. We used a population-based study to estimate and compare the risk of FTD in individuals with and without TBI. Furthermore, we used a rat model of TBI to show that increased TDP-43 proteolysis following TBI produces FTD-like impairments, including abnormal limb-clasping, and impaired performances in the Morris water maze. We recruited 24,585 patients who received ambulatory or hospital care for TBI and 122,925 patients without TBI for this study. Each individual was investigated for 4 years to evaluate FTD development, and data were analyzed by Cox proportional hazard regression. In the TBI rat model, behavior and TDP-43 inclusions were assessed following intracranial administration of a caspase-3 inhibitor or vehicle. FTD was more likely to occur in the TBI group than in the group without TBI (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.43; 95% confidence interval, 3.85–5.10; P &lt; 0.001). Rats developed behavioral impairments similar to those in patients with FTD after TBI. Further, the behavioral impairments were likely associated with TDP-43 short fragment mislocalization and accumulation. Our findings suggest that in humans, TBI is associated with a greater occurrence of FTD. Moreover, clinical FTD manifestations may be associated with TDP-43 proteolysis, since impaired behaviors in TBI rats were reminiscent of those in humans with FTD.

AB  - Abstract
Human leg muscles are often activated inhomogeneously, e.g. in standing. This may also occur in complex tasks like walking. Thus, bipolar surface electromyography (sEMG) may not accurately represent whole muscle activity. This study used 64-electrode high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG) to examine spatial variability of lateral gastrocnemius (LG) muscle activity during the stance phase of walking, maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) and maximal M-waves, and determined the effects of different normalization approaches on spatial and inter-participant variability. Plantar flexion MVC, maximal electrically elicited M-waves and walking at self-selected speed were recorded in eight healthy males aged 24–34. sEMG signals were assessed in four ways: unnormalized, and normalized to MVC, M-wave or peak sEMG during the stance phase of walking. During walking, LG activity varied spatially, and was largest in the distal and lateral regions. Spatial variability fluctuated throughout the stance phase. Normalizing walking EMG signals to the peak value during stance reduced spatial variability within LG on average by 70%, and inter-participant variability by 67%. Normalizing to MVC reduced spatial variability by 17% but increased inter-participant variability by 230%. Normalizing to M-wave produced the greatest spatial variability (45% greater than unnormalized EMG) and increased inter-participant variability by 70%. Unnormalized bipolar LG sEMG may provide misleading results about representative muscle activity in walking due to spatial variability. For the peak value and MVC approaches, different electrode locations likely have minor effects on normalized results, whereas electrode location should be carefully considered when normalizing walking sEMG data to maximal M-waves.

AB  - Abstract
Depression is one of the most common psychiatric symptoms in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Some authors have reported that depression is characterized by activation of the inflammatory response. Animal models of PD also present with depressive-like behavior, such as increased immobility time in the modified forced swim test and anhedonia-like behavior in the sucrose preference test. Considering the potential neuroprotective effect of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in neurodegenerative diseases, the objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of piroxicam on depressive-like behavior in male Wistar rats lesioned with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in the substantia nigra (SN). Antidepressant-like effects were observed after prolonged administration of piroxicam for 21 days. In the forced swim test, the 6-OHDA + saline group exhibited significant reductions in swimming time and increased immobility time compared with the sham + saline. In the sucrose preference test, the 6-OHDA + piroxicam group exhibited no reduction of sucrose preference compared with the sham + saline, with significant effects of treatment and time and a significant treatment × time interaction. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels significantly decreased in the hippocampus in the 6-OHDA + saline group and not changed in the 6-OHDA + piroxicam group when compared with the sham + saline on day 21. In conclusion, 21-day treatment with piroxicam reversed the onset of depressive-like behavior and prevented the reduction of hippocampal 5-HT levels.

AB  - Abstract
Orexins/hypocretins (OXA and OXB) are two hypothalamic peptides involved in the regulation of many physiological processes including the sleep-wake cycle, food intake and arousal. The orexinergic system of the lateral hypothalamus is considered a non-specific peptidergic system, and its nerve fibers innervate numerous brain areas. Among many targets of orexinergic neurons is the intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) of the thalamus – a small but important structure of the mammalian biological clock. In rats, the IGL consists of GABAergic cells which also synthesize different neuropeptides. One group of neurons produces neuropeptide Y (NPY) and sends its axons to the master biological clock known as the suprachiasmatic nuclei. Another neuronal group produces enkephalin and is known to connect contralateral IGLs. This study evaluated the effects of orexins on identified IGL neurons revealing that 58% of the recorded neurons were sensitive to OXA (200 nM) and OXB (200 nM) administration. Both NPY-positive and -negative neurons were depolarized by these neuropeptides. Experiments using selective orexin receptor antagonists (SB-334867, 10 μM and TCS-OX2-29, 10 μM) suggested that both orexin receptors participate in the recorded OXA effects. In addition, IGL neurons were either directly depolarized by OXA or their activity was altered by changes in presynaptic inputs. We observed an increase of GABA release onto the investigated IGL neuron after OXA application, consistent with a presynaptic localization of the orexin receptors. An increase in miniature excitatory postsynaptic current frequency was not observed within the IGL. Our findings reinforce the connection between circadian clock physiology and the orexinergic system.

AB  - Abstract
The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible role of basolateral amygdala (BLA) 5-HT1A receptors in memory formation under stress. We also examined whether the blockade of these receptors is involved in stress-induced state-dependent memory. Adult male Wistar rats received cannula implants that bilaterally targeted the BLA. Long-term memory was examined using the step-through type of passive avoidance task. Behavioral stress was evoked by exposure to an elevated platform (EP) for 10, 20 and 30 min. Post-training exposure to acute stress (30 min) impaired the memory consolidation. In addition, pre-test exposure to acute stress-(20 and 30 min) induced the impairment of memory retrieval. Interestingly, the memory impairment induced by post-training exposure to stress was restored in the animals that received 20- or 30-min pre-test stress exposure, suggesting stress-induced state-dependent memory retrieval. Post-training BLA-targeted injection of a selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, (S)-WAY-100135 (2 μg/rat), prevented the impairing effect of stress on memory consolidation. Pre-test injection of the same doses of (S)-WAY-100135 that was targeted to the BLA also reversed stress-induced memory retrieval impairment. It should be considered that post-training or pre-test BLA-targeted injection of (S)-WAY-100135 (0.5–2 μg/rat) by itself had no effect on the memory formation. Moreover, pre-test injection of (S)-WAY-100135 (2 μg/rat) that targeted the BLA inhibited the stress-induced state-dependent memory retrieval. Taken together, our findings suggest that post-training or pre-test exposure to acute stress induced the impairment of memory consolidation, retrieval and state-dependent learning. The BLA 5-HT1A receptors have a critical role in learning and memory under stress.

AB  - Abstract
The presence of mRNAs in synaptic terminals and their regulated translation are important factors in neuronal communication and plasticity. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) complexes are involved in the translocation, stability, and subcellular localization of mRNA and the regulation of its translation. Defects in these processes and mutations in components of the hnRNP complexes have been related to the formation of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies and neurodegenerative diseases. Despite much data on mRNA localization and evidence for protein synthesis, as well as the presence of translation machinery, in axons and presynaptic terminals, the identity of RNA-binding proteins involved in RNA transport and function in presynaptic regions is lacking. We previously characterized a strongly basic RNA-binding protein (p65), member of the hnRNPA/B subfamily, in squid presynaptic terminals. Intriguingly, in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE), p65 migrated as a 65-kDa protein, whereas members of the hnRNPA/B family typically have molecular masses ranging from 35 to 42 kDa. In this report we present further biochemical and molecular characterization that shows endogenous p65 to be an SDS-stable dimer composed of ∼37-kDa hnRNPA/B-like subunits. We cloned and expressed a recombinant protein corresponding to squid hnRNPA/B-like protein and showed its propensity to aggregate and form SDS-stable dimers in vitro. Our data suggest that this unique hnRNPA/B-like protein co-localizes with synaptic vesicle protein 2 and RNA-binding protein ELAV and thus may serve as a link between local mRNA processing and presynaptic function and regulation.

AB  - Abstract
It has been proposed that spontaneous panic attacks are the outcome of the misfiring of an evolved suffocation alarm system. Evidence gathered in the last years is suggestive that the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) in the midbrain harbors a hypoxia-sensitive suffocation alarm system. We here investigated whether facilitation of 5-HT-mediated neurotransmission within the dPAG changes panic-like defensive reactions expressed by male Wistar rats submitted to a hypoxia challenge (7% O2), as observed in other animal models of panic. Intra-dPAG injection of 5-HT (20 nmol), (±)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT) (8 nmol), a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, or (±)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodo amphetamine hydrochloride (DOI) (16 nmol), a preferential 5-HT2A agonist, reduced the number of upward jumps directed to the border of the experimental chamber during hypoxia, interpreted as escape attempts, without affecting the rats’ locomotion. These effects were similar to those caused by chronic, but not acute, intraperitoneal administration of the antidepressant fluoxetine (5–15 mg/kg), or acute systemic administration of the benzodiazepine receptor agonist alprazolam (1–4 mg/kg), both drugs clinically used in the treatment of panic disorder. Our findings strengthen the view that the dPAG is a key encephalic area involved in the defensive behaviors triggered by activation of the suffocation alarm system. They also support the use of hypoxia-evoked escape as a model of respiratory-type panic attacks.

AB  - Abstract
Very slow fluctuations of spontaneous activities significantly influence not only behavioral performance in a conscious state, but also neural activities in an unconscious state. Covariation of pupil and cortical activities may lend important insights into the state-dependent modulation of stimulus encoding, yet this phenomenon has received little attention, especially with regard to non-visual cortices. In the present study, we investigated co-fluctuation of pupil size and neural activity in the auditory cortex of rats under isoflurane anesthesia. Pupil fluctuation consisted of longitudinal irregular shifts, and 1-min cyclic modulations. Both spontaneous and auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) covaried with the longitudinal fluctuation of pupil size, but not with the 1-min cycle. Pupil size exhibited a positive correlation with spontaneous activity and negative correlation with AEP amplitude, particularly when the pupil size was beyond the normal range. Stimulus-specific adaptation characterized using an oddball paradigm was less dependent on pupil size than AEP. In contrast to the cortical activity, heart rate covaried with pupil size with the 1-min oscillatory component, but not the non-oscillatory component. Furthermore, light exposure induced the pupil reflex through the autonomic system, but did not modify cortical activity, indicating that autonomic activity was not causing the cortical modulation. These results together suggest that cortical activities spontaneously covary with pupillary activity through central cholinergic modulation that triggers sympathetic nerve activation. Such a state-dependent property may be a confounding factor in cortical electrophysiology studies.

AB  - Abstract
Activation of microglia associated with neuroinflammation and loss of phagocytic activity is considered to play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). CHF5074 (CSP-1103) has been shown to improve cognition and reduce brain inflammation in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). CHF5074 was also found to reverse impairments in recognition memory and improve hippocampal long-term potentiation when administered to plaque-free Tg2576 mice (5-month-old) for 4 weeks. Though, no investigation has focused on the consequence of CHF5074 treatment on microglia polarization yet. In this study we evaluated the effect of CHF5074 administration (375 ppm in the diet) to 5-month-old Tg2576 mice on the expression of pro-inflammatory (M1) genes, Interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα) and inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS), and anti-inflammatory/phagocytic (M2) markers Mannose Receptor type C 1 (MRC1/CD206), Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and Chitinase 3-like 3 (Ym1). No changes of pro-inflammatory gene transcription but a reduced expression of MRC1/CD206, TREM2 and Ym1 were detected in the hippocampus of young Tg2576 mice receiving normal diet, when compared to wild-type littermates. CHF5074 did not affect the pro-inflammatory transcription but significantly increased the expression of MRC1/CD206 and Ym1. CHF5074 effects appeared to be hippocampus-specific, as the M2 transcripts were only slightly modified in the cerebral cortex. In primary cultures of mouse astrocyte-microglia, CHF5074 totally suppressed the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β and iNOS induced by 10 μM β-amyloid1–42 (Aβ42). Moreover, CHF5074 significantly increased the expression of anti-inflammatory/phagocytic markers MRC1/CD206 and TREM2, reduced by the Aβ42 application alone. The effect of CHF5074 was not reproduced by ibuprofen (3 μM or 500 μM) or R-flurbiprofen (3 μM or 100 μM), as both compounds limited the pro-inflammatory gene expression but did not modify the anti-inflammatory/phagocytic transcription. These data show that CHF5074 specifically drives the expression of microglia M2 markers either in young Tg2576 hippocampus or in primary astrocyte-microglia cultures, suggesting its potential therapeutic efficacy as microglial modulator in the early phase of AD.

AB  - Abstract
Abnormal α-synuclein (α-syn) expression and aggregation have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). These neurodegenerative disorders, collectively known as synucleinopathies, are usually associated with cognitive impairment that could be caused by impaired hippocampal function. Although abnormal expressions of α-syn and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor are frequently observed in the hippocampus of patients with synucleinopathies, how these proteins interact with each other in hippocampal neurons remains poorly understood. In the present study, primary cultures of hippocampal neurons and α-syn transgenic mice were used to investigate the effect of α-syn on NMDA receptors. Neurons were treated either by direct addition of recombinant human α-syn (hα-syn) to the medium, or by infection with the hα-syn gene, to increase intracellular levels of α-syn. In both cases, NMDA receptor NR1 subunits on the cell surface were reduced while the total amount of NR1 was unchanged, indicating an internalization of NR1 subunits. Neurons with elevated α-syn also showed a profound increase in Rab5B, an isoform of the small GTPases essential for NMDA receptor endocytosis. Knockdown of Rab5B expression by siRNA inhibited the α-syn-induced reduction in surface NR1. The in vitro findings were confirmed in α-syn transgenic mice, showing that increased α-syn expression was accompanied by reduced levels of surface NR1 and increased expression of Rab5B. Due to the essential role of NR1 subunits for assembling a complete NMDA receptor, its reduction on the cell surface indicated impaired receptor function. This was demonstrated by observations that neurons with elevated α-syn showed profound reductions in NMDA-elicited Ca2+ influx and inward current, which were also inhibited by knockdown of Rab5B expression. Our data suggest that increased α-syn expression may impair NMDA receptor function in the hippocampus by reducing the density of NR1 subunits on the cell surface.

AB  - Abstract
The 5-HT6 receptor (5-HT6R) is almost exclusively expressed in the brain and has emerged as a promising target for cognitive disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease. In the present study, we have determined the cell types on which the 5-HT6R is expressed by colocalizing 5-HT6R mRNA with that of a range of neuronal and interneuronal markers in the rat brain. Here, we show that 5-HT6R mRNA was expressed at high levels in medium spiny neurons in caudate putamen and in nucleus accumbens, as well as in the olfactory tubercle. Striatal 5-HT6R mRNA was colocalized with both dopamine D1 and D2 receptor mRNA. 5-HT6R mRNA was moderately expressed in the hippocampus and throughout cortical regions in glutamatergic neurons coexpressing vGluT1. A subset of GAD67-positive GABAergic interneurons (approximately 15%) expressed 5-HT6R mRNA in the cortex and hippocampus, the majority of which belonged to the 5-HT3a receptor (5-HT3aR)-expressing subpopulation. In contrast, 5-HT6R mRNA was only expressed to a minor extent in the parvalbumin and somatostatin subpopulations. A subset of calbindin- and calretinin-positive GABAergic interneurons expressed 5-HT6R mRNA while only a very minor fraction of VIP or NPY interneurons in forebrain structures expressed 5-HT6R mRNA. Serotonergic, dopaminergic or cholinergic neurons did not express 5-HT6R mRNA. These data indicate that the 5-HT6R is located on GABAergic and glutamatergic principal neurons, and on a subset of interneurons mainly belonging to the 5-HT3aR subgroup suggesting that the 5-HT6R is positioned to regulate the balance between excitatory and inhibitory signaling in the brain. These data provide new insights into the mechanisms of 5-HT6R signaling.

AB  - Abstract
Numerous studies have indicated dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) potency to differentiate into several types of cell lineages. Oligodendrocyte lineage transcription factor 2 (OLIG2) plays an important role in the oligodendrogenic pathway. In this study, a tetracycline (Tet)-inducible system expressing OLIG2 gene was transfected into human DPSCs to direct their differentiation toward oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Following induction, the expression of stage-specific markers was studied by Reverse Transcription quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR), immunocytochemistry and western blotting. In the following, the cells were transplanted into the mouse model of local sciatic demyelination damage by lysolecithin.

Recovery of lysolecithin-induced lesions in sciatic nerve was studied by treadmill exercise, von Frey filament test and hind paw withdrawal in response to a thermal stimulus. Improvement of behavioral symptoms was efficiently observed from the second week to the sixth week post-transplantation. Our findings showed that exogenous expression of the OLIG2 gene by a Tet-regulated system could be used as an efficient way to induce the differentiation of DPSCs into functional oligodendrocytes. Meanwhile, the DPSC-derived OPCs have relevant therapeutic potential in the animal model of sciatic nerve injury and therefore might represent a valuable tool for stem cell-based therapy in inflammatory and degenerative diseases of the peripheral and central nervous systems (CNSs).

AB  - Abstract
Schizophrenia is a devastating mental illness. Although its etiology is still largely unknown, strides have been taken throughout the last several decades to elucidate the nature of the neuropathology behind this disorder. The advent of neuroimaging technologies such as computerized axial tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have progressed knowledge about the macroscopic brain changes that occur in schizophrenia, including the characteristic enlarged ventricle size and reductions in gray matter volume, whole-brain volume, and white matter anisotropy. Although this review presents a broad outline of current and historical neuropathological research, the focus is primarily on the quantitative neuropathology of the cerebral cortex in schizophrenia, which may underlie many of the larger scale changes observed. The reduced neuropil hypothesis has been suggested as a microanatomical explanation to account for these macroscopic changes, although the present review finds that evidence does not always support this. A quantitative meta-analytic summary of these studies, focused on neuron density, provides support for the finding of increased neuron density in schizophrenia, with variation dependent on age. This is consistent with neuroimaging data and implicates an altered aging trajectory as a factor in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Combined with evidence from other neuroanatomical studies reviewed here, as well as studies in childhood-onset schizophrenia, the evidence converges on a progressive neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia related to altered neuroplasticity. The evidence also supports a particular vulnerability of inhibitory cortical circuits with markers of interneurons showing some of the more consistent reductions in schizophrenia.

A total of 211 neurons that discharged at the highest rate during sleep (sleep-active neurons) were recorded in non-anesthetized, head-restrained mice during the complete wake–sleep cycle in, and around, the laterodorsal (LDT) and sublaterodorsal (SubLDT) tegmental nuclei, which contain both cholinergic and non-cholinergic neurons. For the first time in mice, I reveal the presence, mainly in the SubLDT, of sleep-specific neurons displaying sustained tonic discharge either (i) just prior to, and during, paradoxical sleep (PS) (PS-on neurons) or (ii) during both slow-wave sleep (SWS) and PS (SWS/PS-on neurons). Both the PS-on and SWS/PS-on neurons showed either a low (&lt;10 Hz) or high (⩾10 Hz) rate of spontaneous firing and exhibited a biphasic narrow or medium-to-broad action potential, a characteristic of non-cholinergic neurons. At the transition from SWS to waking (W), the PS-on and SWS/PS-on neurons simultaneously ceased firing shortly before the onset of W, whereas, at the transition from W to SWS, only the SWS/PS-on neurons fired shortly after the onset of sleep. At the transition from SWS to PS, only the PS-on neurons exhibited a significant increase in discharge rate before PS onset, while, at the transition from PS to W, the SWS/PS-on neurons, then the PS-on neurons, displayed a significant decrease in the discharge rate before the end of PS. The SWS/PS-on neurons were more sensitive to the change in the electroencephalogram (EEG) than the PS-on neurons, as, during a PS episode, the slightest interruption of rhythmic theta activity resulted in cessation of discharge of the SWS/PS-on neurons. These findings support the view that, in the mouse SubLDT, PS-on neurons play an important role in the induction, maintenance, and cessation of PS, while SWS/PS-on neurons play a role in the maintenance of the PS state in particular and the sleep state in general.

Peripheral nerves regenerate following injury due to the effective activation of the intrinsic growth capacity of the neurons and the formation of a permissive pathway for outgrowth due to Wallerian degeneration (WD). WD and subsequent regeneration are significantly influenced by various immune cells and the cytokines they secrete. Although macrophages have long been known to play a vital role in the degenerative process, recent work has pointed to their importance in influencing the regenerative capacity of peripheral neurons. In this review, we focus on the various immune cells, cytokines, and chemokines that make regeneration possible in the peripheral nervous system, with specific attention placed on the role macrophages play in this process.

AB  - Abstract
The role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in lysosome-mediated neuronal death and survival following ischemic stroke remains unknown. Herein, using miRNA and mRNA gene expression profiling microarrays, we identified the differentially expressed 24 miRNAs and 494 genes in the cortical peri-infarct area, respectively. Integrating the miRNA targets and mRNA expression profiles, we found 47 genes of miRNA targets, including lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2), Hexb, Bcl2, etc. MiR-207 and miR-352 were mainly downregulated after ischemic stroke, followed by a slight return to baseline during post-middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) 1 d to 7 d. Furthermore, the luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that LAMP2 and Hexb were the direct targets of miR-207 and miR-352, respectively. After lateral ventricle injection with miR-207 agonist mimics, the neurological deficit scores and infarct volumes were attenuated, and the structure of mitochondria ridges was improved. In addition, miR-207 mimics could reduce the number of cellular lysosome and autophagosome, whereas increase the number of autophagic vacuoles, indicating miR-207 might affect the latter part of lysosomal-autophagy pathway and mitochondria-induced apoptosis. These results suggested that miR-207 and miR-352 were involved in lysosomal pathway for mediating ischemic injury and spontaneous recovery. MiR-207 mimics as potential target drugs could protect against autophagic cell death after ischemic stroke.

AB  - Abstract
One of the most replicated findings has been that hippocampus volume is decreased in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Recent volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies suggest that localized differences in hippocampal volume may be more prominent than global differences. Preclinical and post-mortem studies in MDD indicated that different subfields of the hippocampus may respond differently to stress and may also have differential levels of plasticity in response to antidepressant treatment. Advances in high-field MRI allowed researchers to visualize and measure hippocampal subfield volumes in MDD patients in vivo. The results of these studies provide the first in vivo evidence that hippocampal volume reductions in MDD are specific to the cornu ammonis and dentate gyrus hippocampal subfields, findings that appear, on the surface, consistent with preclinical evidence for localized mechanisms of hippocampal neuroplasticity. In this review we discuss how recent advances in neuroimaging allow researchers to further understand hippocampal neuroplasticity in MDD and how it is related to antidepressant treatment, memory function, and disease progression.

AB  - Abstract
Patients with chronic renal failure often have hypertension, but the cause of hypertension, other than an excess of body fluid, is not well known. We hypothesized that the bulbospinal neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) are stimulated by uremic toxins in patients with chronic renal failure. To investigate whether RVLM neurons are sensitive to uremic toxins, such as uric acid, indoxyl sulfate, or methylguanidine, we examined changes in the membrane potentials (MPs) of bulbospinal RVLM neurons of Wister rats using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique during superfusion with these toxins. A brainstem-spinal cord preparation that preserved the sympathetic nervous system was used for the experiments. During uric acid, indoxyl sulfate, or methylguanidine superfusion, almost all the RVLM neurons were depolarized. To examine the transporters for these toxins on RVLM neurons, histological examinations were performed. The uric acid-, indoxyl sulfate-, and methylguanidine-depolarized RVLM neurons showed the presence of urate transporter 1 (URAT 1), organic anion transporter (OAT)1 or OAT3, and organic cation transporter (OCT)3, respectively. Furthermore, the toxin-induced activities of the RVLM neurons were suppressed by the addition of an anti-oxidation drug (VAS2870, an NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor), and a histological examination revealed the presence of NAD(P)H oxidase (nox)2 and nox4 in these RVLM neurons. The present results show that uric acid, indoxyl sulfate, and methylguanidine directly stimulate bulbospinal RVLM neurons via specific transporters on these neurons and by producing oxidative stress. These uremic toxins may cause hypertension by activating RVLM neurons.

Previous research has demonstrated antidepressant-like effects in rodents upon intracerebral inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Such effects have been reported for local HDAC inhibition in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and amygdala. However, the effect of HDAC inhibition within the medial prefrontal cortex, which is integral to depression-related symptoms and their treatment, remains unknown. Here we show that local infusion of the highly selective HDAC inhibitor, MS-275, into the medial prefrontal cortex exerts robust antidepressant-like effects in the chronic social defeat stress paradigm in mice. These findings provide further impetus for the assessment of HDAC inhibitors for the treatment of depression.

In the present study, we investigated whether endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is associated with neuronal- and astroglial-death in the hippocampus using LiCl-pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) rat model. Glucose-related protein (GRP) 78 and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) expressions were transiently increased in CA1 neurons and dentate granule cells, and subsequently decreased in these cells following SE. GRP94 and calnexin (CNX) expression was gradually reduced in CA1 neurons, not in dentate granule cells. Phospho-protein kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (pPERK), phospho-eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (peIF2A) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) immunoreactivities were observed in 17%, 12% and 7% of degenerating CA1 neurons, respectively. GRP 78 and PDI expressions were also up-regulated in reactive astrocytes within the CA1–3 regions. In the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, PDI-positive astrocytes showed TUNEL signal, nuclear apoptosis inducing factor translocation and pPERK/peIF2A/CHOP immunoreactivities. Four weeks after SE, clasmatodendritic astrocytes showed pPERK peIF2A and CNX immunoreactivities without CHOP expression. These findings indicate that SE-induced ER stress may be associated with astroglial apoptosis and autophagic astroglial death in the regional-specific pattern.

AB  - Abstract
Anatomical studies have demonstrated that hypocretinergic and GABAergic neurons innervate cells in the nucleus pontis oralis (NPO), a nucleus responsible for the generation of active (rapid eye movement (REM)) sleep (AS) and wakefulness (W). Behavioral and electrophysiological studies have shown that hypocretinergic and GABAergic processes in the NPO are involved in the generation of AS as well as W. An increase in hypocretin in the NPO is associated with both AS and W, whereas GABA levels in the NPO are elevated during W. We therefore examined the manner in which GABA modulates NPO neuronal responses to hypocretin. We hypothesized that interactions between the hypocretinergic and GABAergic systems in the NPO play an important role in determining the occurrence of AS or W. To determine the veracity of this hypothesis, we examined the effects of the juxtacellular application of hypocretin-1 and GABA on the activity of NPO neurons, which were recorded intracellularly, in chloralose-anesthetized cats. The juxtacellular application of hypocretin-1 significantly increased the mean amplitude of spontaneous EPSPs and the frequency of discharge of NPO neurons; in contrast, the juxtacellular microinjection of GABA produced the opposite effects, i.e., there was a significant reduction in the mean amplitude of spontaneous EPSPs and a decrease in the discharge of these cells. When hypocretin-1 and GABA were applied simultaneously, the inhibitory effect of GABA on the activity of NPO neurons was reduced or completely blocked. In addition, hypocretin-1 also blocked GABAergic inhibition of EPSPs evoked by stimulation of the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus. These data indicate that hypocretin and GABA function within the context of a neuronal gate that controls the activity of AS-on neurons. Therefore, we suggest that the occurrence of either AS or W depends upon interactions between hypocretinergic and GABAergic processes as well as inputs from other sites that project to AS-on neurons in the NPO.

AB  - Abstract
Located in the nerve terminals of serotonergic neurons, 5-HT1B autoreceptors are poised to modulate synaptic 5-HT levels with precise temporal and spatial control, and play an important role in various emotional behaviors. This study characterized two novel, complementary viral vector strategies to investigate the contribution of 5-HT1B autoreceptors to fear expression, displayed as freezing, during contextual fear conditioning. Increased expression of 5-HT1B autoreceptors throughout the brain significantly decreased fear expression in both wild-type (WT) and 5-HT1B knockout (1BKO) mice when receptor levels were increased with a cell-type-specific herpes simplex virus (HSV) vector injected into the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). Additional studies used an intersectional viral vector strategy, in which an adeno-associated virus containing a double-floxed inverted sequence for the 5-HT1B receptor (AAV-DIO-1B) was combined with the retrogradely transported canine adenovirus-2 expressing Cre (CAV-Cre) in order to increase 5-HT1B autoreceptor expression only in neurons projecting from the DRN to the amygdala. Surprisingly, selective expression of 5-HT1B autoreceptors in just this circuit led to an increase in fear expression in WT, but not 1BKO, mice. These results suggest that activation of 5-HT1B autoreceptors throughout the brain may have an overall effect of attenuating fear expression, but activation of subsets of 5-HT1B autoreceptors in particular brain regions, reflecting distinct projections of serotonergic neurons from the DRN, may have disparate contributions to the ultimate response.

AB  - AbstractBackground
Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is increased in patients with headache, neuropathic pain, periodontal and temporomandibular disease. This study and others have utilized TNF receptor 1/2 (TNFR1/2) knockout (KO) animals to investigate the effect of TNFα dysregulation in generation and maintenance of chronic neuropathic pain. The present study determined the impact of TNFα dysregulation in a trigeminal inflammatory compression (TIC) nerve injury model comparing wild-type (WT) and TNFR1/2 KO mice.
Methods
Chromic gut suture was inserted adjacent to the infraorbital nerve to induce the TIC model mechanical hypersensitivity. Cytokine proteome profiles demonstrated serology, and morphology explored microglial activation in trigeminal nucleus 10 weeks post.
Results
TIC injury induced ipsilateral whisker pad mechanical allodynia persisting throughout the 10-week study in both TNFR1/2 KO and WT mice. Delayed mechanical allodynia developed on the contralateral whisker pad in TNFR1/2 KO mice but not in WT mice. Proteomic profiling 10 weeks after chronic TIC injury revealed TNFα, interleukin-1alpha (IL-1α), interleukin-5 (IL-5), interleukin-23 (IL-23), macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β), and granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were increased more than 2-fold in TNFR1/2 KO mice compared to WT mice with TIC. Bilateral microglial activation in spinal trigeminal nucleus was detected only in TNFR1/2 KO mice. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor and microglial inhibitor minocycline reduced hypersensitivity.
Conclusions
The results suggest the dysregulated serum cytokine proteome profile and bilateral spinal trigeminal nucleus microglial activation are contributory to the bilateral mechanical hypersensitization in this chronic trigeminal neuropathic pain model in the mice with TNFα dysregulation. Data support involvement of both neurogenic and humoral influences in chronic neuropathic pain.

AB  - Abstract
Pain anticipation plays a critical role in pain chronification and results in disability due to pain avoidance. It is important to understand how different sensory modalities (auditory, visual or tactile) may influence pain anticipation as different strategies could be applied to mitigate anticipatory phenomena and chronification. In this study, using a countdown paradigm, we evaluated with magnetoencephalography the neural networks associated with pain anticipation elicited by different sensory modalities in normal volunteers. When encountered with well-established cues that signaled pain, visual and somatosensory cortices engaged the pain neuromatrix areas early during the countdown process, whereas the auditory cortex displayed delayed processing. In addition, during pain anticipation, the visual cortex displayed independent processing capabilities after learning the contextual meaning of cues from associative and limbic areas. Interestingly, cross-modal activation was also evident and strong when visual and tactile cues signaled upcoming pain. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and mid-cingulate cortex showed significant activity during pain anticipation regardless of modality. Our results show pain anticipation is processed with great time efficiency by a highly specialized and hierarchical network. The highest degree of higher-order processing is modulated by context (pain) rather than content (modality) and rests within the associative limbic regions, corroborating their intrinsic role in chronification.

AB  - Abstract
Background: Minocycline, a second-generation tetracycline alleviates neuro-inflammation and protects the blood–brain barrier (BBB) in ischemia stroke. However, the effect of minocycline in hypoxia-induced BBB damage is unclear. Here, we have investigated the effect of minocycline under hypoxia and explored its possible underlying mechanisms. Methods: The effect of minocycline was examined in vitro in Human Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells (HBMECs) using Trans Epithelial Electric Resistance (TEER). Protein and mRNA expression of Hypoxia-Inducible Factors-1α (HIF-1α), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and tight junction proteins (TJs) were detected by using Western blot and quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The translocation and transcription of HIF-1α were detected by using immunocytochemistry and luciferase reporter assay. In vivo, to adult male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats under hypobaric hypoxia were administered minocycline for 1 h and BBB permeability was tested by using Evans Blue and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Also, reduction of NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-3 (SIRT-3)/proline hydroxylase-2 (PHD-2) signaling pathway was evaluated. Results: Minocycline increased TEER in HBMECs after hypoxia (P &lt; 0.05), and reduced the extravasation of Evans Blue (P &lt; 0.05) and colloidal gold nanoparticles in rats. Minocycline administration significantly reduced HIF-1α expression, protein and mRNA expression of MMP-2, MMP-9 and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) (P &lt; 0.05), and increased TJs (ZO-1, claudin-5 and occluding) (P &lt; 0.05) in HBMECs after hypoxia. Furthermore, minocycline reversed the hypoxia-induced reduction of PHD-2 (P &lt; 0.05) and SIRT-3 (P &lt; 0.05). Effects of minocycline were abolished by siRNA-mediated knockdown of SIRT-3 in the brain. Conclusions: Minocycline inhibits HIF-1α-mediated cellular responses and protects BBB integrity through SIRT-3/PHD-2 pathway, proving to be a potential drug for the prevention and treatment of hypoxic brain injuries.

The aim of this study is to determine how pitch acceleration rates within and outside the normal pitch range may influence latency and amplitude of cortical pitch-specific responses (CPR) as a function of language experience (Chinese, English). Responses were elicited from a set of four pitch stimuli chosen to represent a range of acceleration rates (two each inside and outside the normal voice range) imposed on the high rising Mandarin Tone 2. Pitch-relevant neural activity, as reflected in the latency and amplitude of scalp-recorded CPR components, varied depending on language-experience and pitch acceleration of dynamic, time-varying pitch contours. Peak latencies of CPR components were shorter in the Chinese than the English group across stimuli. Chinese participants showed greater amplitude than English for CPR components at both frontocentral and temporal electrode sites in response to pitch contours with acceleration rates inside the normal voice pitch range as compared to pitch contours with acceleration rates that exceed the normal range. As indexed by CPR amplitude at the temporal sites, a rightward asymmetry was observed for the Chinese group only. Only over the right temporal site was amplitude greater in the Chinese group relative to the English. These findings may suggest that the neural mechanism(s) underlying processing of pitch in the right auditory cortex reflect experience-dependent modulation of sensitivity to acceleration in just those rising pitch contours that fall within the bounds of one’s native language. More broadly, enhancement of native pitch stimuli and stronger rightward asymmetry of CPR components in the Chinese group is consistent with the notion that long-term experience shapes adaptive, distributed hierarchical pitch processing in the auditory cortex, and reflects an interaction with higher order, extrasensory processes beyond the sensory memory trace.

AB  - Abstract
Hippocampal atrophy, as evidenced using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is one of the most validated, easily accessible and widely used biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, its imperfect sensitivity and specificity have highlighted the need to improve the analysis of MRI data. Based on neuropathological data showing a differential vulnerability of hippocampal subfields to AD processes, neuroimaging researchers have tried to capture corresponding morphological changes within the hippocampus.

The present review provides an overview of the methodological developments that allow the assessment of hippocampal subfield morphology in vivo, and summarizes the results of studies looking at the effects of AD and normal aging on these structures.

Most studies highlighted a focal atrophy of the CA1 subfield in the early (predementia or even preclinical) stages of AD, before atrophy becomes more widespread at the dementia stage, consistent with the pathological literature. Preliminary studies have indicated that looking at this focal atrophy pattern rather than standard whole hippocampus volumetry improves diagnostic accuracy at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage. However, controversies remain regarding changes in hippocampal subfield structure in normal aging and regarding correlations between specific subfield volume and memory abilities, very likely because of the strong methodological variability between studies.

Overall, hippocampal subfield analysis has proven to be a promising technique in the study of AD. However, harmonization of segmentation protocols and studies on larger samples are needed to enable accurate comparisons between studies and to confirm the clinical utility of these techniques.

AB  - Abstract
Hypertension is the most significant modifiable risk factor for vascular cognitive impairment. However, influence of hypertension on the development of ischemic white matter injury and cognitive dysfunction is not fully understood. We compared cognitive functions and neuropathological outcomes of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO) between normotensive rats (NRs) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). SHRs developed earlier and more severe deficits in spatial memory performance than NRs following BCCAO. Although no significant changes in the gross structure of myelinated white matter or oligodendrocyte number were noted, BCCAO resulted in subtle myelin degeneration and paranodal structural alterations at the nodes of Ranvier, regardless of hypertension. Disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) was predominantly observed in the white matter of SHRs following BCCAO, implying a role of hypertension in BBB dysfunction in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. In chronic cerebral ischemia, long-standing hypertension may aggravate impairment of BBB integrity, and the leaky BBB may in turn exacerbate dysfunction in the white matter leading to worsening of spatial cognitive performance.

The effect of bilateral intra-frontal cortex Aβ (1–42) peptide injection on the intrinsic excitability of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons with particular focus on the contribution of hyperpolarization-activated (Ih) channel currents was examined using whole-cell patch-clamp recording. Passive avoidance memory impairment and morphological changes in rats receiving intra-frontal Aβ treatment were observed, which was associated with significant changes both in passive and active intrinsic electrical membrane properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Electrophysiological recording showed a significant decrease in neuronal excitability associated with an augmentation in the first spike after-hyperpolarization (AHP) amplitude. In addition, the depolarizing sag voltage was altered in neurons recorded from Aβ-treated group. In voltage-clamp condition, a hyperpolarizing activated inward current sensitive to ZD7288 and capsaicin was significantly increased in neurons from Aβ-treated rats. The Ih current density was increased and the activation curve was shifted toward less negative potential in the Aβ-treated group as compared to control group. The enhancing effect of Aβ treatment on Ih current was confirmed by showing upregulation of the mRNA of HCN1 channel in the CA1 pyramidal layer of hippocampi.

These findings suggest the contribution of Ih and possibly TRPV1 channel currents to the changes induced by Aβ treatment in the intrinsic membrane properties, which, in turn, may provide therapeutic targets for treatment of AD.

AB  - Abstract
Accumulated evidence suggests that enhanced neurogenesis stimulated by ischemic injury contributes to stroke outcome. However, it is unclear whether hyperglycemia, which is frequently tested positive in patients with acute ischemic stroke, influences stroke-induced neurogenesis. The aim of the present study is to examine the effect of hyperglycemia on stroke-induced neurogenesis in a rat model of transient focal cerebral ischemia. For this purpose, adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (220–250 g) were subjected to 90 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Glucose was administered during ischemia to produce target blood levels ranging from 4.83 ± 0.94 mM (normoglycemia) to 20.76 ± 1.56 mM. To label proliferating cells in ischemic ipsilateral subventricular zone (SVZ) of lateral ventricles, 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected 24 h after MCAO. Brains were harvested 2 h post-BrdU to evaluate the effects of hyperglycemia on infarct volume and SVZ cell proliferation. Rats that were severely hyperglycemic (19.26 ± 1.48 mM to 20.76 ± 1.56 mM) during ischemia had 24.26% increase in infarct volume (P &lt; 0.05) and more serious neurological function deficits (P &lt; 0.05). The severe hyperglycemic rats also showed dramatically decreased proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) (P &lt; 0.05) and down-regulation of the phosphorylation of cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) (P &lt; 0.05)and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (P &lt; 0.05) in ipsilateral SVZ. But the above-mentioned detrimental effects were not observed in rats that were rendered with mild hyperglycemia (9.43 ± 1.39–10.13 ± 1.24 mM). Our findings indicate that severe instead of mild hyperglycemia exacerbates ischemic injury and inhibits stroke-induced SVZ neurogenesis by a mechanism involving suppression of CREB and BDNF signaling.

AB  - Abstract
Whereas activation of α1-adrenoceptors (α1-ARs) modulates glutamatergic transmission, the roles of α1-ARs in GABAergic transmission in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are elusive. Here, we examined the effects of the α1-AR agonist phenylephrine (Phe) on GABAergic transmission onto pyramidal neurons in the deep layers of the mPFC. We found that bath application of Phe dose-dependently increased the amplitude of evoked IPSCs (eIPSCs). Phe increased the frequency but not the amplitude of miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs). Ca2+ influx through T-type voltage-gated calcium channels is required for Phe-induced increases in GABA release. Phe increases GABA release probability and the number of releasable vesicles. Phe depolarizes the fast-spiking (FS) interneurons without effects on the firing rate of action potentials (APs) of interneurons. Phe-induced depolarization is independent of extracellular Na+, Ca2+ and T-type calcium channels, but requires inward rectifier K+ channels (Kirs). The present study demonstrates that Phe enhances GABAergic transmission onto mPFC pyramidal neurons through inhibiting interneurons Kirs, which further depolarizes interneurons leading to increase in Ca2+ influx via T-type calcium channels. Our results may provide a cellular and molecular mechanism that helps explain α1-AR-induced PFC dysfunction.

AB  - Abstract
Ghrelin is a potent orexigenic hormone that acts in the central nervous system to stimulate food intake via the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) that is abundantly expressed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Not only does ghrelin modulate feeding behavior via a homeostatic mechanism, but numerous studies have identified ghrelin as a key regulator of reward-based hedonic feeding behaviors. Nutritional states influence ghrelin and GHSR expression as well as the behavioral sensitivity to reward-inducing stimuli. In the current study, we examined the role of ghrelin at the VTA level in food intake in two different nutritional states, satiety and hunger, by using a restricted feeding model. In this model, rats were conditioned to a daily 3-h (h) feeding session on standard chow for 10 days and a high-fat diet (HFD) was supplied either in the third hour after 2 h of chow diet intake, or at the beginning of a daily meal on the test day. We found that intra-VTA microinjection of 1, 2, and 4 μg of ghrelin, induced a dose-related increase of 1 h of reward-based feeding on HFD in sated rats, as well as a 24-h body weight gain. The overconsumption stimulated by ghrelin could be attenuated by 10 μg of direct infusion of the ghrelin receptor antagonist D-Lys3-GHRP-6 into the VTA. Moreover, our data showed that the injection of 1, 2, and 4 μg of ghrelin in the VTA, enhanced fasting-induced hyperphagia on HFD in a dose-related manner following a 21-h food restriction as well as a 24-h body weight gain. Conversely, hyperphagia on HFD that is potentiated by ghrelin could be blocked by pretreatment with a 10-μg D-Lys3-GHRP-6 intra-VTA microinjection. Collectively, these data demonstrate that ghrelin signaling at the VTA level mediates both reward-based eating and fasting-induced hyperphagia and provides a primary target for the control of the intake of rewarding food.

AB  - Abstract
Adenosine (Ado) and non-adenosine (non-Ado) nucleosides such as inosine (Ino), guanosine (Guo) and uridine (Urd) may have regionally different roles in the regulation of physiological and pathophysiological processes in the central nervous system (CNS) such as epilepsy. It was demonstrated previously that Ino and Guo decreased quinolinic acid (QA)-induced seizures and Urd reduced penicillin-, bicuculline- and pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures. It has also been demonstrated that Ino and Urd may exert their effects through GABAergic system by altering the function of GABAA type of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABAA receptors) whereas Guo decreases glutamate-induced excitability through glutamatergic system, which systems (GABAergic and glutamatergic) are involved in pathomechanisms of absence epilepsy. Thus, we hypothesized that Ino and Guo, similarly to the previously described effect of Urd, might also decrease absence epileptic activity. We investigated in the present study whether intraperitoneal (i.p.) application of Ino (500 and 1000 mg/kg), Guo (20 and 50 mg/kg), Urd (500 and 1000 mg/kg), GABAA receptor agonist muscimol (1 and 3 mg/kg), GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (2 and 4 mg/kg), non-selective Ado receptor antagonist theophylline (5 and 10 mg/kg) and non-competitive N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo (a,d) cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate (MK-801, 0.0625 and 0.1250 mg/kg) alone and in combination have modulatory effects on absence epileptic activity in Wistar Albino Glaxo Rijswijk (WAG/Rij) rats. We found that Guo decreased the number of spike-wave discharges (SWDs) whereas Ino increased it dose-dependently. We strengthened that Urd can decrease absence epileptic activity. Our results suggest that Guo, Urd and their analogs could be potentially effective drugs for treatment of human absence epilepsy.

AB  - Abstract
L-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) is the therapeutic gold standard in Parkinson’s disease. However, long-term treatment is complicated by the induction of debilitating abnormal involuntary movements termed L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LIDs). Until today the underlying mechanisms of LID pathogenesis are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to reveal new factors, which may be involved in the induction of LID. We have focused on the expression of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+) neurons, which are capable of producing either L-DOPA or dopamine (DA) in target areas of ventral midbrain DAergic neurons.

To address this issue, a daily L-DOPA dose was administered over the course of 15 days to mice with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesions of the medial forebrain bundle and LIDs were evaluated. Remarkably, the number of striatal TH+ neurons strongly correlated with both induction and severity of LID as well as ΔFosB expression as an established molecular marker for LID. Furthermore, dyskinetic mice showed a marked augmentation of serotonergic fiber innervation in the striatum, enabling the decarboxylation of L-DOPA to DA. Axial, limb and orolingual dyskinesias were predominantly associated with TH+ neurons in the lateral striatum, whereas medially located TH+ neurons triggered locomotive rotations. In contrast, identified accumbal and cortical TH+ cells did not contribute to the generation of LID.

Thus, striatal TH+ cells and serotonergic terminals may cooperatively synthesize DA and subsequently contribute to supraphysiological synaptic DA concentrations, an accepted cause in LID pathogenesis.

AB  - Abstract
Previous results from our laboratory showed that angiotensin II AT1 receptors (AT1-R) are involved in the neuroadaptative changes induced by amphetamine. The aim of the present work was to study functional and neurochemical responses to angiotensin II (ANG II) mediated by AT1-R activation in animals previously exposed to amphetamine. For this purpose male Wistar rats (250–320 g) were treated with amphetamine (2.5 mg/kg/day intraperitoneal) or saline for 5 days and implanted with intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) cannulae. Seven days after the last amphetamine administration the animals received ANG II (400 pmol) i.c.v. One group was tested in a free choice paradigm for sodium (2% NaCl) and water intake and sacrificed for Fos immunoreactivity (Fos-IR) determinations. In a second group of rats, urine and plasma samples were collected for electrolytes and plasma renin activity determination and then they were sacrificed for Fos-IR determination in Oxytocinergic neurons (Fos-OT-IR). Results: Repeated amphetamine exposure (a) prevented the increase in sodium intake and Fos-IR cells in caudate-putamen and accumbens nucleus induced by ANG II i.c.v. (b) potentiated urinary sodium excretion and Fos-OT-IR in hypothalamus and (c) increased the inhibitory response in plasma renin activity, in response to ANG II i.c.v. Our results indicate a possible functional desensitisation of AT1-R in response to ANG II, induced by repeated amphetamine exposure. This functional AT1-R desensitisation allows to unmask the effects of ANG II i.c.v. mediated by oxytocin. We conclude that the long lasting changes in brain AT1-R functionality should be considered among the psychostimulant-induced neuroadaptations.

AB  - Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients not only exhibit motor impairments, but also characteristic deficits in cognitive and affective functions. Such functions have consistently been associated with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). To determine whether there is an interaction between the midbrain dopamine system (MDS) and the mPFC underlying the cognitive and emotional deficits seen in rats, we administered a disconnection procedure of these structures by applying lesions to the mPFC (N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA)) and the medial forebrain bundle (6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)) either in the same or opposite hemispheres. The results indicate a functional interaction of the MDS and the mPFC: Disconnection effects on behavior were observed with respect to memory-, anxiety- and depression-related behaviors. A disconnection of the mPFC and MDS had promnestic, antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects. In order to determine whether this circuit between the mPFC and MDS involves serotonergic mechanisms, we also utilized serotonin-specific disconnections of the mPFC by applying the 5-HT-specific agent 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) into the mPFC and 6-OHDA into the medial forebrain bundle, again either in the same or opposite hemispheres. The behavioral effects observed here resembled those incurred by the unspecific disconnection of the mPFC, demonstrating a significant contribution of serotonergic mechanisms to the interplay between the MDS and the mPFC. Taken together, these experiments provide evidence for an interaction of the MDS and the mPFC in the control of cognitive and affective processes known to be impaired in PD and point toward a prominent involvement of the serotonergic system. A disconnection of the mPFC and the MDS had promnestic, antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like behavioral effects. These findings may impact therapeutic approaches in the treatment of cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms seen in PD.

Understanding the role of brain regions in anatomical neural networks with Parkinson’s disease (PD) is essential for improving the clinical protocol or finding new targets for deep brain stimulation (DBS). Although numerous changes have been reported in local functional studies, few studies have reported on the anatomical network of the entire brain. Here, by developing a series of algorithms, this study provided a whole anatomical neural network of the macaque monkey. Then, the drifts in centrality from normal to PD networks were described in terms of complex network analysis and summarized with principal component analysis. Results revealed that the areas including the striatum, globus pallidus, amygdala, prefrontal lobe, thalamus, hippocampus, visual cortex, insula, etc., showed relatively notable drifts in their own patterns. The present study also demonstrated that the current targets of DBS shared a common feature: their centrality values being relatively low in the normal brain while intensely drifting with PD.

AB  - Abstract
Glucose concentration changes in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) affect visceral function and metabolism by influencing central vagal circuits, especially inhibitory, GABAergic NTS neurons. Acutely elevated glucose can alter NTS neuron activity, and prolonged hyperglycemia and hypoinsulemia in animal models of type 1 diabetes results in plasticity of neural responses in the NTS. NTS neurons contributing to metabolic regulation therefore act as central glucose sensors and are functionally altered in type 1 diabetes. Glucokinase (GCK) mediates cellular utilization of glucose, linking increased glucose concentration to excitability changes mediated by ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP). Using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot, and in vitro electrophysiology, we tested the hypothesis that changes in GCK expression in the NTS accompany the development of diabetes symptoms in the streptozotocin (STZ)-treated mouse model of type 1 diabetes. After several days of hyperglycemia in STZ-treated mice, RNA expression of GCK, but not Kir6.2 or SUR1, was decreased versus controls in the dorsal vagal complex. Electrophysiological recordings in vitro indicated that neural responses to acute hyperglycemia, and synaptic responsiveness to blockade of GCK with glucosamine, were attenuated in GABAergic NTS neurons from STZ-treated mice, consistent with reduced molecular and functional expression of GCK in the vagal complex of hyperglycemic, STZ-treated mice. Altered autonomic responses to glucose in type 1 diabetes may therefore involve reduced functional GCK expression in the dorsal vagal complex.

AB  - Abstract
Filial imprinting in precocial birds is a useful model for studying early learning and cognitive development, as it is characterized by a well-defined sensitive or critical period. We recently showed that the thyroid hormone 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3) determines the onset of the sensitive period. Moreover, exogenous injection of T3 into the intermediate medial mesopallium (IMM) region (analogous to the associative cortex in mammals) enables imprinting even on post-hatch day 4 or 6 when the sensitive period has been terminated. However, the neural mechanisms downstream from T3 action in the IMM region remain elusive. Here, we analyzed the functional involvement of the intermediate hyperpallium apicale (IMHA) in T3 action. Bilateral excitotoxic ablation of the IMHA prevented imprinting in newly hatched chicks, and also suppressed the recovery of the sensitive period by systemic intra-venous or localized intra-IMM injection of T3 in day-4 chicks. In contrast to the effect in the IMM, direct injection of T3 into the IMHA did not enable imprinting in day-4 chicks. Moreover, bilateral ablation of IMHA after imprinting training impaired recall. These results suggest that the IMHA is critical for memory acquisition downstream following T3 action in the IMM and further, that it receives and retains information stored in the IMM for recall. Furthermore, both an avian adeno-associated viral construct containing an anterograde tracer (wheat-germ agglutinin) and a retrograde tracer (cholera toxin subunit B) revealed neural connections from the IMM to the IMHA. Taken together, our findings suggest that hierarchical processes from the primary area (IMM) to the secondary area (IMHA) are required for imprinting.

AB  - Abstract
Regulation of GABA release in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) potently influences vagal output to the viscera. The presence of functional ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) on GABAergic terminals that rapidly alter GABA release onto DMV motor neurons has been suggested previously, but the receptor subtypes contributing to the response are unknown. We examined the effect of selective activation and inhibition of iGluRs on tetrodotoxin-insensitive, miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in DMV neurons using patch-clamp recordings in brainstem slices from mice. Capsaicin, which activates transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) receptors and increases mIPSC frequency in the DMV via an iGluR-mediated, heterosynaptic mechanism, was also applied to assess GABA release subsequent to capsaicin-stimulated glutamate release. Application of glutamate, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), or kainic acid (KA), but not AMPA, resulted in increased mIPSC frequency in most neurons. Inhibition of AMPA/KA receptors reduced mIPSC frequency, but selective antagonism of AMPA receptors did not alter GABA release, implicating the presence of presynaptic KA receptors on GABAergic terminals. Whereas NMDA application increased mIPSC frequency, blocking NMDA receptors was without effect, indicating that presynaptic NMDA receptors were present, but not activated by ambient glutamate levels in the slice. The effect of NMDA was prevented by AMPA/KA receptor blockade, suggesting indirect involvement of NMDA receptors. The stimulatory effect of capsaicin on GABA release was prevented when AMPA/KA or NMDA, but not AMPA receptors were blocked. Results of these studies indicate that presynaptic NMDAR and KA receptors regulate GABA release in the DMV, representing a heterosynaptic arrangement for rapidly modulating parasympathetic output, especially when synaptic excitation is elevated.

AB  - Abstract
Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is usually expressed in the nucleus as a non-histone chromatin-associated protein. After passively released by necrotic cells, it functions as an IL-1 family member. IL-33 is highly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), whether IL-33 is actively released in the CNS and involved in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) remains unclear. In this study, we found that IL-33 and receptor ST2 were expressed in the spinal cord of naïve mice. Compared to naive situation, the intracellular IL-33 was dramatically decreased and extracellular IL-33 was markedly increased in the spinal cord in the pre-onset, onset and peak stage of EAE. In the chronic stage, the reverse happened. The decrease of intracellular IL-33 was related to the activation of astrocytes and the damage of neurons in situ during EAE. Astrocytes secreted IL-33 actively upon inflammatory stimulation in vitro. Furthermore, blockage of the CNS-derived IL-33 exacerbated EAE development. Our data demonstrated that IL-33 was released by activated astrocytes actively, and by damaged neurons during EAE. It plays a suppressive role in EAE development via an autocrine or paracrine manner. Our findings are helpful to understand the release feature and function of the CNS-derived IL-33 and supply a potential therapeutic target for multiple sclerosis.

AB  - Abstract
Measures of psychopathy have been proved to be valuable for risk assessment in violent criminals. However, the neuronal basis of psychopathy and its contribution to the prediction of criminal recidivism is still poorly understood. We compared structural imaging data from 40 male high-risk violent offenders and 37 non-delinquent healthy controls via voxel-based morphometry. Psychopathic traits and risk of violence recidivism were correlated with gray matter volume (GMV) of regions of interest previously shown relevant for criminal behavior. Relative to controls, criminals showed less GMV in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and more GMV in cerebellar regions and basal ganglia structures. Within criminals, we found a negative correlation between prefrontal GMV and psychopathy. Additionally, there was a positive correlation between cerebellar GMV and psychopathy as well as risk of recidivism for violence. Moreover, GMVs of the basal ganglia and supplementary motor area (SMA) were positively correlated with anti-sociality. GMV of the amygdala was negatively correlated with dynamic risk for violence recidivism. In contrast, GMV of (para)limbic areas (orbitofrontal cortex, insula) was positively correlated with anti-sociality and risk of violence recidivism. The current investigation revealed that in violent offenders deviations in GMV of the PFC as well as areas involved in the motor component of impulse control (cerebellum, basal ganglia, SMA) are differentially related to psychopathic traits and the risk of violence recidivism. The results might be valuable for improving existing risk assessment tools.

AB  - Abstract
Glutamate receptors sensitive to N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) are involved in embryonic brain development but their activity may be modulated by the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism which includes an agonist (quinolinic acid) and an antagonist (kynurenic acid) at these receptors. Our previous work has shown that prenatal inhibition of the pathway produces abnormalities of brain development. In the present study kynurenine and probenecid (both 100 mg/kg, doses known to increase kynurenic acid levels in the brain) were administered to female Wistar rats on embryonic days E14, E16 and E18 of gestation and the litter was allowed to develop to post-natal day P60. Western blotting revealed no changes in hippocampal expression of several proteins previously found to be altered by inhibition of the kynurenine pathway including the NMDA receptor subunits GluN1, GluN2A and GluN2B, as well as doublecortin, Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), sonic hedgehog and unco-ordinated (unc)-5H1 and 5H3. Mice lacking the enzyme kynurenine-3-monoxygenase (KMO) also showed no changes in hippocampal expression of several of these proteins or the 70-kDa and 100-kDa variants of Disrupted in Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1). Electrical excitability of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices was unchanged, as was paired-pulse facilitation and inhibition. Long-term potentiation was decreased in the kynurenine-treated rats and in the KMO(−/−) mice, but galantamine reversed this effect in the presence of nicotinic receptor antagonists, consistent with evidence that it can potentiate glutamate at NMDA receptors. It is concluded that interference with the kynurenine pathway in utero can have lasting effects on brain function of the offspring, implying that the kynurenine pathway is involved in the regulation of early brain development.

AB  - Abstract
Extremely mild hypothermia to 36.0 °C is not thought to appreciably differ clinically from 37.0 °C. However, it is possible that 36.0 °C stimulates highly sensitive hypothermic signaling mechanism(s) and alters biochemistry. To the best of our knowledge, no such ultra-sensitive pathway/mechanisms have been described. Here we show that cold stress protein RNA binding motif 3 (RBM3) increases in neuron and astrocyte cultures maintained at 33 °C or 36 °C for 24 or 48 h, compared to 37 °C controls. Neurons cultured at 36 °C also had increased global protein synthesis (GPS). Finally, we found that melatonin or fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) augmented RBM3 upregulation in young neurons cooled to 36 °C. Our results show that a 1 °C reduction in temperature can induce pleiotropic biochemical changes by upregulating GPS in neurons which may be mediated by RBM3 and that this process can be pharmacologically mimicked and enhanced with melatonin or FGF21.

AB  - Abstract
Oscillating field stimulation (OFS) has been used in attempts to treat spinal cord injury (SCI) and has been shown to improve remyelination after SCI in rats. However, some controversies regarding the effects of OFS have been presented in previous papers. Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are the main cell for remyelination and are derived from the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). To date, it has been unclear whether the differentiation of OPCs can be regulated by OFS. The goal of this study was to determine if OFS can improve the differentiation of OPCs and promote the recovery of neurological function after SCI in rats. Immature and mature OLs were observed in spinal cord slices through immunofluorescence staining. Levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Basso–Beattie–Bresnahan (BBB) scores and transcranial magnetic motor-evoked potentials (tcMMEPs) were used to evaluate the locomotor outcomes of rats after SCI. Our results showed a significant improvement in the differentiation of OPCs and the content of ATP and LIF in the injured spinal cord in the OFS group. Furthermore, BBB scores and tcMMEPs were significantly improved in the rats stimulated by OFS. These findings suggest that OFS can improve the differentiation of OPCs and promote the recovery of neurological function following SCI in rats.

AB  - Abstract
Constraints involving the delivery method of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) have hampered its efficacy as a neuroprotectant in Parkinson’s disease. Ex vivo gene therapy, in which suitable cells, such as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), are genetically engineered to overexpress GDNF (GDNF-MSCs) prior to transplantation may be more beneficial than direct brain infusion of the neurotrophin. Previously, GDNF-MSCs have been assessed in the commonly employed 6-hydroxydopamine neurotoxic model of Parkinson’s disease. In this study however, we used an emerging inflammatory model of Parkinson’s disease (the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) model) to assess the ability of transplanted GDNF-MSCs to protect against LPS-induced neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and behavioral impairment.

Thirty male Sprague–Dawley rats were used in this experiment. Rats were performance matched based on baseline motor function tests into three groups (LPS lesion only, LPS lesion + GFP-MSCs, LPS lesion + GDNF-MSCs; n = 10/group). Both cell groups received a unilateral intra-striatal transplant of either 200,000 GDNF-MSCs or 200,000 GFP-MSCs (as a control). One day post-transplantation, all rats received a unilateral intra-nigral infusion of LPS (10 μg in 2 μl sterile saline). Rats were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion-fixation and their brains were used for post mortem quantitative immunohistochemistry.

Injection of LPS into the substantia nigra induced a pronounced local inflammatory response which resulted in 20% loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and impaired contralateral motor function. Following transplantation of GDNF-MSCs to the striatum, dense areas of TH-positive staining directly proximal to the transplant site were observed. Most importantly, this effect was observed only in the GDNF-MSC transplanted group and not the GFP-MSC transplanted group demonstrating protection and/or sprouting of the dopaminergic terminals induced by the secreted GDNF. This study is the first to highlight the neurotrophic capability of GDNF in the inflammation-driven LPS model and, while future studies will endeavor to improve this approach by increasing cell survival, this work highlights the potential of GDNF delivery by ex vivo gene therapy using MSCs.

AB  - Abstract
Multisensory integration is one of the essential features of perception. Though the processing of spatial information is an important clue to understand its mechanisms, a complete knowledge cannot be achieved without taking into account the processing of temporal information. Simultaneity judgments (SJs) and temporal order judgments (TOJs) are the two most widely used procedures for explicit estimation of temporal relations between sensory stimuli. Behavioral studies suggest that both tasks recruit different sets of cognitive operations. On the other hand, empirical evidence related to their neuronal underpinnings is still scarce, especially with regard to multisensory stimulation. The aim of the current fMRI study was to explore neural correlates of both tasks using paradigm with audiovisual stimuli. Fifteen subjects performed TOJ and SJ tasks grouped in 18-second blocks. Subjects were asked to estimate onset synchrony or temporal order of onsets of non-semantic auditory and visual stimuli. Common areas of activation elicited by both tasks were found in the bilateral fronto-parietal network, including regions whose activity can be also observed in tasks involving spatial selective attention. This can be regarded as an evidence for the hypothesis that tasks involving selection based on temporal information engage the similar regions as the attentional tasks based on spatial information. The direct contrast between the SJ task and the TOJ task did not reveal any regions showing stronger activity for SJ task than in TOJ task. The reverse contrast revealed a number of left hemisphere regions which were more active during the TOJ task than the SJ task. They were found in the prefrontal cortex, the parietal lobules (superior and inferior) and in the occipito-temporal regions. These results suggest that the TOJ task requires recruitment of additional cognitive operations in comparison to SJ task. They are probably associated with forming representations of stimuli as separate and temporally ordered sensory events.

AB  - Abstract
Genetic background is known to influence the outcome in mouse models of human disease, and previous experimental studies have shown strain variability in the neonatal mouse model of hypoxia–ischemia. To further map out this variability, we compared five commonly used mouse strains: C57BL/6, 129SVJ, BALB/c, CD1 and FVB in a pure hypoxic–ischemic setup and following pre-sensitization with lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

Postnatal day 7 pups were subjected to unilateral carotid artery occlusion followed by continuous 30 min 8% oxygen exposure at 36 °C. Twelve hours prior, a third of the pups received a single intraperitoneal LPS (0.6 μg/g) or a saline (vehicle) administration, respectively; a further third underwent hypoxia–ischemia alone without preceding injection. Both C57BL/6 and 129SVJ strains showed minimal response to 30 min hypoxia–ischemia alone, BALB/c demonstrated a moderate response, and both CD1 and FVB revealed the highest brain damage. LPS pre-sensitization led to substantial increase in overall brain infarction, microglial and astrocyte response and cell death in four of the five strains, with exception of BALB/c that only showed a significant effect with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). Saline administration prior to hypoxia–ischemia resulted in an increase in inflammatory-associated markers, particularly in the astroglial activation of C57BL/6 mice, and in combined microglial activation and neuronal cell loss in FVB mice. Finally, two of the four strongly affected strains – C57BL/6 and CD1 – revealed pronounced contralateral astrogliosis with a neuroanatomical localization similar to that observed on the occluded hemisphere.

Overall, the current findings demonstrate strain differences in response to hypoxia–ischemia alone, to stress associated with vehicle injection, and to LPS-mediated pre-sensitization, which partially explains the high variability seen in the neonatal mouse models of hypoxia–ischemia. These results can be useful in future studies of fetal/neonatal response to inflammation and reduced oxygen–blood supply.

AB  - Abstract
The development of a hyperexcitable neuronal network is thought to be a critical event in epilepsy. Thrombospondins (TSPs) regulate synaptogenesis by binding the neuronal α2δ subunit of the voltage-gated calcium channel. TSPs regulate synapse formation during development and in the mature brain following injury. It is unclear if TSPs are involved in hyperexcitability that contributes to the development of epilepsy. Here we explore the development of epilepsy using a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) kindling model in mice lacking TSP1 and TSP2.

Unexpectedly, we found increased sensitivity to PTZ kindling in mice lacking TSP1, while mice lacking TSP2 kindled similar to wild-type. We found that the increased seizure susceptibility in the TSP1 knockout (KO) mice was not due to a compensatory increase in TSP2 mRNA as TSP1/2 KO mice were sensitive to PTZ, similar to the TSP1 KO mice. Furthermore, there were similar levels of TGF-B signal activation during kindling in the TSP1 KO mice compared to wild-type. We observed decreased expression of voltage-dependent calcium channel subunit CACNA2D1 mRNA in TSP1, TSP2, and TSP1/2 KO mice. Decreased CACNA2D2 mRNA was only detected in mice that lacked TSP1 and α2δ-1/2 protein levels in the cortex were lower in the TSP 1/2 KO mice. CACNA2D2 knockout mice have spontaneous seizures and increased PTZ seizure susceptibility. Here we report similar findings, TSP1, and TSP1/2 KO mice have low levels of CACNA2D2 mRNA expression and α2δ-1/2 receptor level in the cortex, and are more susceptible to seizures. CACNA2D2 mutations in mice and humans can cause epilepsy. Our data suggest TSP1 in particular may control CACNA2D2 levels and could be a modifier of seizure susceptibility.

AB  - Abstract
There is growing interest in the development of cannabis-based therapies for the treatment of fear and anxiety disorders. There are a few studies, but none in females, of the effects of the highly selective cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) agonist, arachidonyl 2′-chlorethylamide (ACEA), on behavioral fear. In experiment 1 involving gonadally-intact females, ACEA (either 0.1 or 0.01 mg/kg) was without effect in the elevated plus maze (EPM), and the lower dose decreased anxiety in the open field test (OFT). AM251 increased anxiety in the EPM and decreased locomotor activity in the OFT. Twenty-four hours after fear conditioning, neither ACEA nor AM251 affected generalized fear or conditioned fear recall. AM251 and 0.1 mg/kg ACEA impaired, and 0.01 mg/kg ACEA enhanced, within-session fear extinction. AM251 increased plasma corticosterone concentrations after the fear extinction session, whereas ACEA was without effect. Based on evidence that estradiol may moderate the effects of CB1 receptor signaling in females, experiment 2 involved ovariectomized (OVX) rats provided with 10-μg 17β-Estradiol and compared with OVX rats without hormone replacement (oil vehicle). Irrespective of hormone treatment, AM251 increased anxiety in the EPM, whereas ACEA (0.01 mg/kg) was without effect. Neither hormone nor drug altered anxiety in the OFT, but estradiol increased and AM251 decreased distance traveled. After fear conditioning, AM251 decreased generalized fear. Neither hormone nor drug had any effect on recall or extinction of conditioned fear, however, ACEA and AM251 increased fear-induced plasma corticosterone concentrations. Further, when results with intact rats were compared with those from OVX rats, gonadal status did not moderate the effects of either AM251 or ACEA, although OVX displayed greater anxiety and fear than did intact rats. Thus, the effects of CB1 receptor antagonism and agonism in adult female rats do not depend on ovarian estradiol.

AB  - Abstract
Learning and memory impairment is one of the most challenging complications of cirrhosis and present treatments are unsatisfactory. The exact mechanism of cirrhosis cognitive dysfunction is unknown. Pregnenolone sulfate (PREGS) is an excitatory neurosteroid that acts as a N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonist and GABAA receptor antagonist. In this study we evaluated the effect of intra CA1 infusion of PREGS on cirrhotic rats’ memory function using the Y-maze test. Hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression was also evaluated. Three weeks after bile duct ligation (BDL) surgery, rats were under stereotaxic surgery for insertion of two guide cannulas in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. After 1-week of recovery, PREGS was administered through CA1 cannulas in cirrhotic rats, while control or sham groups received vehicle. For evaluation of NMDA receptor role in memory-enhancing effects of PREGS, DL-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5) which is a potent and competitive antagonist of NMDA receptor, co-administered with PREGS and for assessment of hippocampal BDNF mRNA expression, quantitative Real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) was used. Results showed that 28 days after BDL, cirrhotic animals’ memory significantly decreased in comparison with control and sham groups, while PREGS infusion could restore memory impairment (P &lt; 0.05). PREGS effects on memory of cirrhotic rats were antagonized by DAP5. RT-PCR findings have shown that hippocampal relative BDNF mRNA expression was up-regulated in PREGS-treated groups in comparison with the BDL group (P &lt; 0.001). Our findings suggest that PREGS has a memory-enhancing effect in cirrhosis memory deficit in acute therapy and this effect may be through NMDA (glutamate) receptor involvement and BDNF mRNA expression.

AB  - Abstract
Glucose uptake in neurons depends on their cellular/physiological activity and the extracellular concentration of glucose around the cell. High concentration of extra-cellular glucose, as under hyperglycemic conditions or pathological condition in diabetes, may persist for extended periods of time in neurons and trigger cellular damage by altering voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs), the exact mechanism of which remains unclear. Therefore, we hypothesized that high glucose may directly affect kinetics of the VGSCs in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. DRG neurons were exposed to normal glucose (NG: 5.5 mM) and high glucose (HG: 30 mM) for 24 h. In another set of experiments, diabetic DRG neurons were also isolated from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Effects of sodium channel blockers on nociceptive parameters and tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) Na+ channel kinetics were elucidated by whole-cell patch-clamp in HG exposure and diabetes-induced rat DRG neurons. HG exposure and diabetes-induced DRG neurons demonstrated significant increase in TTX-R Na+ current (INa) densities in comparison to the control. Both HG-exposed and diabetic DRG neurons demonstrated similar biophysical characteristics of INa. Lidocaine and tetracaine significantly decreased TTX-R INa density in a concentration- and voltage-dependent manner. Steady-state fast inactivation of INa was shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction whereas voltage-dependent activation was shifted in the rightward direction. Diabetic rats treated with lidocaine and tetracaine (3 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly improved thermal hyperalgesia, mechanical allodynia and motor nerve conduction velocity with a significant inhibition of TTX-R INa density as compared to the diabetic control. These results suggest that HG exposure increases the TTX-R Na+ channel activity sensitive to Na+ channel blockers, lidocaine and tetracaine.

AB  - Abstract
Macaque monkeys use complex communication calls and are regarded as a model for studying the coding and decoding of complex sound in the auditory system. However, little is known about the distribution of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the auditory system of macaque monkeys. In this study, we examined the overall distribution of cell bodies that expressed mRNAs for VGLUT1, and VGLUT2 (markers for glutamatergic neurons), GAD67 (a marker for GABAergic neurons), and GLYT2 (a marker for glycinergic neurons) in the auditory system of the Japanese macaque. In addition, we performed immunohistochemistry for VGLUT1, VGLUT2, and GAD67 in order to compare the distribution of proteins and mRNAs. We found that most of the excitatory neurons in the auditory brainstem expressed VGLUT2. In contrast, the expression of VGLUT1 mRNA was restricted to the auditory cortex (AC), periolivary nuclei, and cochlear nuclei (CN). The co-expression of GAD67 and GLYT2 mRNAs was common in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL), CN, and superior olivary complex except for the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, which expressed GLYT2 alone. In contrast, the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, inferior colliculus, thalamus, and AC expressed GAD67 alone. The absence of co-expression of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in the medial geniculate, medial superior olive, and VNLL suggests that synaptic responses in the target neurons of these nuclei may be different between rodents and macaque monkeys.

AB  - Abstract
Defining the markers corresponding to a high risk of developing depression in humans would have major clinical significance; however, few studies have been conducted since they are not only complex but also require homogeneous groups. This study compared congenital learned helpless (cLH) rats, selectively bred for high stress sensitivity and learned helplessness (LH) behavior, to congenital non-learned helpless (cNLH) rats that were bred for resistance to uncontrollable stress. Naïve cLH rats show some depression-like behavior but full LH behavior need additional stress, making this model ideal for studying vulnerability to depression. Resting-state functional connectivity obtained from seed correlation analysis was calculated for multiple regions that were selected by anatomy AND by a data-driven approach, independently. Significance was determined by t-statistic AND by permutation analysis, independently. A significant reduction in functional connectivity was observed by both analyses in the cLH rats in the sensory, motor, cingulate, infralimbic, accumbens and the raphe nucleus. These reductions corresponded primarily to reduced inter-hemispheric connectivity. The main reduction however was in the sensory system. It is argued that reduced connectivity and inter-hemispheric connectivity of the sensory system reflects an internal convergence state which may precede other depressive symptomatology and therefore could be used as markers for vulnerability to the development of depression.

AB  - Abstract
Objective: The present study tested the hypothesis that exposure to in vitro hypoxia–ischemia alters membrane properties and excitability as well as excitatory synaptic transmission of CA1 pyramidal neurons in the neonatal mouse. Methods: Experiments were conducted in hippocampal slices in P7–P9 C57Bl/6 mice using whole-cell patch clamp in current- and voltage-clamp mode. Passive membrane potential (Vm), input resistance (Rin) and active (action potential (AP) threshold and amplitude) membrane properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons were assessed at baseline, during 10 min in vitro ischemia (oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)) and during reoxygenation. Spontaneous and miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (s and mEPSCs) were studied under similar conditions. Results: OGD caused significant depolarization of CA1 pyramidal neurons as well as decrease in AP threshold and increase in AP amplitude. These changes were blocked by the application of tetrodotoxin (TTX), indicating Na+ channels’ involvement. Following 10 min of reoxygenation, significant membrane hyperpolarization was noted and it was associated with a decrease in Rin. AP threshold and amplitude returned to baseline during that stage. sEPSC and mEPSC frequency increased during both OGD and reoxygenation but their amplitude remained unchanged. Additionally, we found that OGD decreases Ih (hyperpolarization activated current) in CA1 neurons from neonatal mice and this effect persists during reoxygenation. Significance: These results indicate that in vitro ischemia leads to changes in membrane excitability mediated by sodium and potassium channels. Further, it results in enhanced neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals. These changes are likely to represent one of the mechanisms of hypoxia/ischemia-mediated seizures in the neonatal period.

AB  - Abstract
Infraorbital nerve constriction (CION) causes hypersensitivity to facial mechanical, heat and cold stimulation in rats and mice and is a reliable model to study trigeminal neuropathic pain. In this model there is evidence that mechanisms operated by kinin B1 and B2 receptors contribute to heat hyperalgesia in both rats and mice. Herein we further explored this issue and assessed the role of kinin receptors in mechanical hyperalgesia after CION. Swiss and C57Bl/6 mice that underwent CION or sham surgery or dynorphin A (1–17) administration were repeatedly submitted to application of either heat stimuli to the snout or mechanical stimuli to the forehead. Treatment of the animals on the fifth day after CION surgery with DALBK (B1 receptor antagonist) or HOE-140 (B2 receptor antagonist), both at 0.01–1 μmol/kg (i.p.), effectively reduced CION-induced mechanical hyperalgesia. Knockout mice for kinin B1, B2 or B1/B2 receptors did not develop heat or mechanical hyperalgesia in response to CION. Subarachnoid dynorphin A (1–17) delivery (15 nmol/5 μL) also resulted in orofacial heat hyperalgesia, which was attenuated by post-treatment with DALBK (1 and 3 μmol/kg, i.p.), but was not affected by HOE-140. Additionally, treatment with an anti-dynorphin A antiserum (200 μg/5 μL, s.a.) reduced CION-induced heat hyperalgesia for up to 2 h. These results suggest that both kinin B1 and B2 receptors are relevant in orofacial sensory nociceptive changes induced by CION. Furthermore, they also indicate that dynorphin A could stimulate kinin receptors and this effect seems to contribute to the maintenance of trigeminal neuropathic pain.

AB  - Abstract
The complex neuronal circuitry of the cerebellum is embedded within its lamina, folia, and lobules, which together play an important role in sensory and motor function. Studies in mouse models have demonstrated that both cerebellar lamination and lobule/fissure development are under genetic control. The cerebellar vermis of C57BL/6 mice exhibits spontaneous malformations of neuronal migration of posterior lobules (VIII–IX; molecular layer heterotopia); however, the extent to which other inbred mice also exhibit these malformations is unknown. Using seven different inbred mouse strains and two first filial generation (F1) hybrids, we show that only the C57BL/6 strain exhibits heterotopia. Furthermore, we observed heterotopia in consomic and recombinant inbred strains. These data indicate that heterotopia formation is a weakly penetrant trait requiring homozygosity of one or more C57BL/6 alleles outside of chromosome 1 and the sex chromosomes. Additional morphological analyses showed no relationship between heterotopia formation and other features of lobule/fissure organization. These data are relevant toward understanding normal cerebellar development and disorders affecting cerebellar foliation and lamination.

AB  - Abstract
Electron tomography and immunogold labeling were used to analyze similarities and differences in the morphology and protein composition of postsynaptic densities (PSDs) isolated from adult rat cerebella, hippocampi, and cortices. There were similarities in physical dimensions and gross morphology between cortical, hippocampal and most cerebellar PSDs, although the morphology among cerebellar PSDs could be categorized into three distinct groups. The majority of cerebellar PSDs were composed of dense regions of protein, similar to cortical and hippocampal PSDs, while others were either composed of granular or lattice-like protein regions. Significant differences were found in protein composition and organization across PSDs from the different brain regions. The signaling protein, βCaMKII, was found to be a major component of each PSD type and was more abundant than αCaMKII in both hippocampal and cerebellar PSDs. The scaffold molecule PSD-95, a major component of cortical PSDs, was found absent in a fraction of cerebellar PSDs and when present was clustered in its distribution. In contrast, immunogold labeling for the proteasome was significantly more abundant in cerebellar and hippocampal PSDs than cortical PSDs. Together, these results indicate that PSDs exhibit remarkable diversity in their composition and morphology, presumably as a reflection of the unique functional demands placed on different synapses.

AB  - Abstract
Diabetics are at risk for a number of serious health complications including an increased incidence of epilepsy and poorer recovery after ischemic stroke. Astrocytes play a critical role in protecting neurons by maintaining extracellular homeostasis and preventing neurotoxicity through glutamate uptake and potassium buffering. These functions are aided by the presence of potassium channels, such as Kir4.1 inwardly rectifying potassium channels, in the membranes of astrocytic glial cells. The purpose of the present study was to determine if hyperglycemia alters Kir4.1 potassium channel expression and homeostatic functions of astrocytes. We used q-PCR, Western blot, patch-clamp electrophysiology studying voltage and potassium step responses and a colorimetric glutamate clearance assay to assess Kir4.1 channel levels and homeostatic functions of rat astrocytes grown in normal and high glucose conditions. We found that astrocytes grown in high glucose (25 mM) had an approximately 50% reduction in Kir4.1 mRNA and protein expression as compared with those grown in normal glucose (5 mM). These reductions occurred within 4–7 days of exposure to hyperglycemia, whereas reversal occurred between 7 and 14 days after return to normal glucose. The decrease in functional Kir channels in the astrocytic membrane was confirmed using barium to block Kir channels. In the presence of 100-μM barium, the currents recorded from astrocytes in response to voltage steps were reduced by 45%. Furthermore, inward currents induced by stepping extracellular [K+]o from 3 to 10 mM (reflecting potassium uptake) were 50% reduced in astrocytes grown in high glucose. In addition, glutamate clearance by astrocytes grown in high glucose was significantly impaired. Taken together, our results suggest that down-regulation of astrocytic Kir4.1 channels by elevated glucose may contribute to the underlying pathophysiology of diabetes-induced CNS disorders and contribute to the poor prognosis after stroke.

AB  - Abstract
Using fear-conditioning model, we have used a 3-s auditory conditioned stimulus (CS) as a stressor and observed fear and stress responses during a specific experimental period regardless of the presence or absence of the CS. Because the CS was extremely short compared with the experimental period, we observed responses primarily in the absence of the CS. In contrast, most studies in the literature have analyzed responses in the presence of the CS. Therefore, the characteristics of fear and stress responses in the absence of the CS remain to be clarified. To clarify this, we compared the characteristics of fear and stress responses elicited by a 3-s auditory CS with those observed during a 20-s auditory CS. The basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA), but not the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), participated in the fear response elicited by the 3-s CS, whereas both the BLA and BNST were involved in the response observed during the 20-s CS. Additional analyses revealed that the BNST participated in the fear response during the 20-s CS when the CS was paired with a 0.75-mA, but not with a 0.9-mA, foot shock, and to the contextual CS. In addition, the fear response elicited by the 3-s CS was more resistant to extinction than that during the 20-s CS. Finally, the 3-s CS produced more intense freezing and corticosterone secretion than the 20-s CS. On the basis of these characteristics, we conclude that the 3-s auditory CS is a more effective stressor than the 20-s auditory CS. Our findings also suggest that foot shock intensity is an additional determinant in the type of fear response induced by the CS.

Although several studies have suggested the neuroprotective effect of thymosin β4 (TB4), a major actin-sequestering protein, on the central nervous system, little is understood regarding the action of N-acetyl-serylaspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP), a peptide fragment of TB4 on brain function. Here, we examined neurogenesis-stimulative effect of Ac-SDKP. Intrahippocampal infusion of Ac-SDKP facilitated the generation of new neurons in the hippocampus. Ac-SDKP-treated mouse hippocampus showed an increase in β-catenin stability with reduction of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) activity. Moreover, inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling blocked Ac-SDKP-facilitated neural proliferation. Subchronic intrahippocampal infusion of Ac-SDKP also increased spatial memory. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Ac-SDKP functions as a regulator of neural proliferation and indicate that Ac-SDKP may be a therapeutic candidate for diseases characterized by neuronal loss.

AB  - Abstract
Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) transplantation can ameliorate cognitive impairment in chronic ischemic brain injury, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. It is considered that the hippocampus holds the capabilities of memory consolidation and spatial navigation, and the gamma amino butyric acid (GABA)ergic system plays an important role in the control of learning and memory processes. Herein, we investigated whether transplantation of BMSCs could improve cognitive impairment via regulating the hippocampal GABAergic system in a rat model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Animals treated with permanent bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries (two-vessel occlusion, 2VO) (a rat model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion) received intravenous injections of BMSCs or saline as experimental group and control group I, the sham-operated rats received intravenous injections of BMSCs or saline as the sham group and control group II. Four weeks later, the Morris Water Maze was employed to evaluate the cognitive changes of each group, immunohistochemistry and western blotting was used to investigate the GABAergic system expression including GABA, glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) or GABAB receptor 1 (GABABR1) in the hippocampus. Our results showed that the 2VO model presented decreased capacities of learning and memory and down-regulated the expression of GABA, GAD67 or GABABR1 in the hippocampal CA1 subfield in comparison to the sham group (P &lt; 0.05), while administration of BMSCs (experimental group) manifested increased performances of learning sessions and probe tasks, as well as up-regulated expression of GABA, GAD67 or GABABR1 compared with the control group I (P &lt; 0.05). Collectively, these findings suggest that transplantation of BMSCs is capable of improving cognitive impairment via up-regulating the hippocampal GABAergic system in a rat model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Hence, BMSCs transplantation could serve as an important tool for cell therapy in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Alcohol hangover (AH) is defined as the temporary state after alcohol binge-like drinking, starting when ethanol (EtOH) is absent in plasma. Previous data indicate that AH induces mitochondrial dysfunction and free radical production in mouse brain cortex. The aim of this work was to study mitochondrial function and reactive oxygen species production in mouse cerebellum at the onset of AH. Male mice received a single i.p. injection of EtOH (3.8 g/kg BW) or saline solution. Mitochondrial function was evaluated 6 h after injection (AH onset). At the onset of AH, malate-glutamate and succinate-supported state 4 oxygen uptake was 2.3 and 1.9-fold increased leading to a reduction in respiratory control of 55% and 48% respectively, as compared with controls. Decreases of 38% and 16% were found in Complex I–III and IV activities. Complex II–III activity was not affected by AH. Mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial permeability changes were evaluated by flow cytometry. Mitochondrial membrane potential and permeability were decreased by AH in cerebellum mitochondria. Together with this, AH induced a 25% increase in superoxide anion and a 92% increase in hydrogen peroxide production in cerebellum mitochondria. Related to nitric oxide (NO) metabolism, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) protein expression was 52% decreased by the hangover condition compared with control group. No differences were found in cerebellum NO production between control and treated mice. The present work demonstrates that the physiopathological state of AH involves mitochondrial dysfunction in mouse cerebellum showing the long-lasting effects of acute EtOH exposure in the central nervous system.

AB  - Abstract
Hippocampal anatomy and network organization are capable to generate drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in humans and particularly vulnerable to segmental neuronal cell loss. Surgical hippocampectomy has been proven successful in treatment and available human tissue specimens allow systematic clinico-pathological examination. Different patterns of hippocampal cell loss have been identified in TLE patients and are recently classified by the International League against Epilepsy (ILAE) into four distinct subtypes in order to stratify the heterogenous group of TLE patients also with respect to postsurgical outcome. Another important aim of the international consensus classification system of hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is to gain further insights into the morpho-functional organization of human memory frequently compromised in TLE patients.

AB  - Abstract
Naphthalen-1-yl-(1-pentylindol-3-yl)methanone (JWH-018) is a synthetic cannabinoid agonist illegally marketed in “Spice” and “herbal blend” for its psychoactive effect greater than those produced by cannabis. In rodents JWH-018 reproduces typical effects of (−)-Δ9-THC or Dronabinol® (Δ9-THC) such as hypothermia, analgesia, hypolocomotion and akinesia, while its effects on sensorimotor functions are still unknown. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of acute administration of JWH-018 (0.01–6 mg/kg i.p.) on sensorimotor functions in male CD-1 mice and to compare its effects with those caused by the administration of Δ9-THC (0.01–6 mg/kg i.p.). A specific battery of behavioral tests were adopted to investigate effects of cannabinoid agonists on sensorimotor functions (visual, auditory, tactile) and neurological changes (convulsion, myoclonia, hyperreflexia) while video-tracking analysis was used to study spontaneous locomotion. JWH-018 administration inhibited sensorimotor responses at lower doses (0.01–0.1 mg/kg), reduced spontaneous locomotion at intermediate/high doses (1–6 mg/kg) and induced convulsions, myoclonia and hyperreflexia at high doses (6 mg/kg). Similarly, administration of Δ9-THC reduced sensorimotor responses in mice but it did not inhibit spontaneous locomotion and it did not induce neurological alterations. All behavioral effects and neurological alterations were prevented by the administration of the selective CB1 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist 1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-4-methyl-N-(piperidin-1-yl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (AM 251). For the first time these data demonstrate that JWH-018 impairs sensorimotor responses in mice. This aspect should be carefully evaluated to better understand the potential danger that JWH-018 may pose to public health, with particular reference to decreased performance in driving and hazardous works.

AB  - Abstract
Gamma time–frequency responses (TFRs) induced by painful laser in the contralateral primary somatosensory (SI) cortex have been shown to correlate with perceived pain-intensity in human. Given the functional roles of gamma TFRs in the cortical spaces, it remains unclear whether such a relationship is sustained for other brain regions where the laser-evoked potentials (LEPs) are presented. In this study, we delivered the painful laser pluses at random pain-intensity levels (i.e. strong, medium and weak) in a single train to the dorsal hand of six patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The laser stimulus produced a painful pinprick sensation by activating nociceptors located in the superficial layers of the skin. For each patient, arrays of &gt;64 subdural electrodes were implanted directly covering the contralateral SI, parasylvian (PS) and medial frontal (MF) cortices to study the stimulus related gamma (TFRs) in the neocortex. In addition, using the same stimulation paradigm, the modality specificity of gamma TFRs was further examined by applying innocuous vibrotactile stimuli to the same regions of the dorsal hand in a separated group of five patients. Our results showed that gamma TFRs are not modality specific, but the largest gamma TFRs were consistently found within the SI region and noxious laser elicited significantly stronger gamma TFRs than innocuous nonpainful vibratory stimuli. Furthermore, stronger pain induced stronger gamma TFRs in the cortices of SI (r = 0.4, p &lt; 0.001) and PS (r = 0.29, p = 0.005). Given that potentially harmful noxious stimulus would automatically capture greater attention than the innocuous ones, our results support the hypothesis that the degree of SI and PS gamma TFRs is associated with an attentional drive provoked by painful stimuli.

AB  - Abstract
The proteins alpha-synuclein (αSyn) and leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are both key players in the pathogenesis of the neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson’s disease (PD), but establishing a functional link between the two proteins has proven elusive. Research studies for these two proteins have traditionally and justifiably focused in neuronal cells, but recent studies indicate that each protein could play a greater pathological role elsewhere. αSyn is expressed at high levels within neurons, but they also secrete the protein into the extracellular milieu, where it can have broad ranging effects in the nervous system and relevance to disease etiology. Similarly, low neuronal LRRK2 expression and activity suggests that LRRK2-related functions could be more relevant in cells with higher expression, such as brain-resident microglia. Microglia are monocytic immune cells that protect neurons from noxious stimuli, including pathological αSyn species, and microglial activation is believed to contribute to neuroinflammation and neuronal death in PD. Interestingly, both αSyn and LRRK2 can be linked to microglial function. Secreted αSyn can directly activate microglia, and can be taken up by microglia for clearance, while LRRK2 has been implicated in the intrinsic regulation of microglial activation and of lysosomal degradation processes. Based on these observations, the present review will focus on how PD-associated mutations in LRRK2 could potentially alter microglial biology with respect to neuronally secreted αSyn, resulting in cell dysfunction and neurodegeneration.

AB  - Abstract
Transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily A, member 1 (TRPA1) is expressed in muscle afferents and direct activation of these receptors induces acute mechanical hypersensitivity. However, the functional role of TRPA1 under pathological muscle pain conditions and mechanisms by which TRPA1 mediate muscle pain and hyperalgesia are not clearly understood. Two rodent behavioral models validated to assess craniofacial muscle pain conditions were used to study ATP- and N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-induced acute mechanical hypersensitivity and complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA)-induced persistent mechanical hypersensitivity. The rat grimace scale (RGS) was utilized to assess inflammation-induced spontaneous muscle pain. Behavioral pharmacology experiments were performed to assess the effects of AP18, a selective TRPA1 antagonist under these conditions. TRPA1 expression levels in trigeminal ganglia (TG) were examined before and after CFA treatment in the rat masseter muscle. Pre-treatment of the muscle with AP18 dose-dependently blocked the development of acute mechanical hypersensitivity induced by NMDA and α,β-methylene adenosine triphosphate (αβmeATP), a specific agonist for NMDA and P2X3 receptor, respectively. CFA-induced mechanical hypersensitivity and spontaneous muscle pain responses were significantly reversed by post-treatment of the muscle with AP18 when CFA effects were most prominent. CFA-induced myositis was accompanied by significant up-regulation of TRPA1 expression in TG. Our findings showed that TRPA1 in muscle afferents plays an important role in the development of acute mechanical hypersensitivity and in the maintenance of persistent muscle pain and hypersensitivity. Our data suggested that TRPA1 may serve as a downstream target of pro-nociceptive ion channels, such as P2X3 and NMDA receptors in masseter afferents, and that increased TRPA1 expression under inflammatory conditions may contribute to the maintenance of persistent muscle pain and mechanical hyperalgesia. Mechanistic studies elucidating transcriptional or post-translational regulation of TRPA1 expression under pathological pain conditions should provide important basic information to further advance the treatment of craniofacial muscle pain conditions.

AB  - Abstract
Anhydroexfoliamycin (1) and undecylprodigiosin (2) have been previously described as neuroprotective molecules against oxidative stress in neurons. Since oxidative stress is strongly correlated with neurodegenerative diseases, we have evaluated their effects over the principal hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Both compounds were tested in vitro in two different neuroblastoma cellular models, one for amyloid precursor protein metabolism studies (BE(2)-M17) and another one specific for taupathology in AD (SH-SY5Y-TMHT441). Amyloid-beta (Aβ) levels, β-secretase (BACE1) activity, tau phosphorylation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3β) expression were analyzed and while undecylprodigiosin (2) produced poor results, anhydroexfoliamycin (1) strongly inhibited GSK3β, reducing tau phosphorylation in vitro (0.1 μM). A competitive assay of anhydroexfoliamycin (1) and the specific c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor, SP600125, showed that the reduction of the phosphorylated tau levels is mediated by the JNK pathway in SH-SY5Y-TMHT441 cells. Thus, this compound was tested in vivo by intraperitoneal administration in 3xTg-AD mice, confirming the positive results registered in the in vitro assays. This work presents anhydroexfoliamycin (1) as a promising candidate for further studies in drug development against neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Abstract
Cross-frequency coupling has been shown to be functionally significant in cortical information processing, potentially serving as a mechanism for integrating functionally relevant regions in the brain. In this study, we evaluate the hypothesis that pain-related gamma oscillatory responses are coupled with low-frequency oscillations in the frontal lobe, amygdala and hippocampus, areas known to have roles in pain processing. We delivered painful laser pulses to random locations on the dorsal hand of five patients with uncontrolled epilepsy requiring depth electrode implantation for seizure monitoring. Two blocks of 40 laser stimulations were delivered to each subject and the pain-intensity was controlled at five in a 0–10 scale by adjusting the energy level of the laser pulses. Local-field-potentials (LFPs) were recorded through bilaterally implanted depth electrode contacts to study the oscillatory responses upon processing the painful laser stimulations. Our results show that painful laser stimulations enhanced low-gamma (LH, 40–70 Hz) and high-gamma (HG, 70–110 Hz) oscillatory responses in the amygdala and hippocampal regions on the right hemisphere and these gamma responses were significantly coupled with the phases of theta (4–7 Hz) and alpha (8–12 Hz) rhythms during pain processing. Given the roles of these deep brain structures in emotion, these findings suggest that the oscillatory responses in these regions may play a role in integrating the affective component of pain, which may contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the affective information processing in humans.

AB  - Abstract
Microglia/macrophages play a crucial role in inflammation after spinal cord injury (SCI). Although extensive studies have been performed on the mechanisms of microglia/macrophage activation and recruitment, how microglia/macrophages are eliminated remains unclear. In the present study, we observed a high-level expression of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL), a key molecule in the execution of necroptosis, in microglia/macrophages after SCI in mice. In vivo PI-labeling and Necrostatin-1 treatment confirmed the necroptosis of microglia/macrophages. Interestingly, our electronic microscopic (EM) study revealed that MLKL localized not only at the membrane but also on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of necroptotic microglia/macrophages. Furthermore, receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3), another necrosome component, was also found on the ER of necroptotic microglia/macrophages. And Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), an ER stress sensor, was up-regulated in MLKL-positive microglia/macrophages after SCI, suggesting a possible link between necroptosis and ER stress. In vitro, oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) stress induced ER stress and necroptosis in microglia. Inhibiting ER stress by 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) significantly blocked the OGD-induced necroptosis of microglia. In the end, our data showed that, GRP78 and phosphorylated MLKL were co-expressed by the microglia/macrophages in the injured human spinal cord. Taken together, these results suggested that microglia/macrophages undergo an ER-stress involved necroptosis after SCI, implying that ER stress and necroptosis could be manipulated for modulating inflammation post-SCI.

AB  - Abstract
Triheptanoin, an oily substance, consists of glycerol bound to three molecules of heptanoic acid, a C7 odd-chain fatty acid. A triheptanoin-rich diet has anaplerotic effects because heptanoate metabolism yields succinate which delivers substrates to the Krebs cycle. While previous studies on the effects of triheptanoin focused on metabolic disorders and epilepsy, we investigated triheptanoin’s effect on ischemic stroke. Mice were fed a triheptanoin-enriched diet for 14 days; controls received soybean oil. Only mice fed triheptanoin had measurable quantities of odd-numbered fatty acids in the plasma and brain. Transient ischemia was induced in the brain by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) for 60 min. One day later, mice were tested for neurological function (chimney, rotarod and corner tests) which was found to be better preserved in the triheptanoin group. Microdialysis demonstrated that the strong, neurotoxic increase of extracellular glutamate, which was observed in the mouse striatum during MCAO, was strongly reduced in triheptanoin-fed mice while glucose levels were not affected. Triheptanoin diet reduced the infarct area in stroked mice by about 40%. In ex vivo-experiments with isolated mitochondria, ischemia was found to cause a reduction of mitochondrial respiratory activity. This reduction was attenuated by triheptanoin diet in complex II and IV. In parallel measurements, ATP levels and mitochondrial membrane potential were reduced in control animals but were preserved in triheptanoin-fed mice. We conclude that triheptanoin-fed mice which sustained an experimental stroke had a significantly improved neurological outcome. This beneficial effect is apparently due to an improvement of mitochondrial function and preservation of the cellular energy state. Our findings identify triheptanoin as a promising new dietary agent for neuroprotection.

AB  - Abstract
Understanding the mechanisms that influence brain excitability and synchronization provides hope that epileptic seizures can be controlled. In this scenario, non-synaptic mechanisms have a critical role in seizure activity. The contribution of ion transporters to the regulation of seizure-like activity has not been extensively studied. Here, we examined how non-synaptic epileptiform activity (NEA) in the CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions of the hippocampal formation were affected by kainic acid (KA) administration. NEA enhancement in the DG and suppression in area CA1 were associated with increased NKCC1 expression in neurons and severe neuronal loss accompanied by marked glial proliferation, respectively. Twenty-four hours after KA, the DG exhibited intense microglial activation that was associated with reduced cell density in the infra-pyramidal lamina; however, cellular density recovered 7 days after KA. Intense Ki67 immunoreactivity was observed in the subgranular proliferative zone of the DG, which indicates new neuron incorporation into the granule layer. In addition, bumetanide, a selective inhibitor of neuronal Cl− uptake mediated by NKCC1, was used to confirm that the NKCC1 increase effectively contributed to NEA changes in the DG. Furthermore, 7 days after KA, prominent NKCC1 staining was identified in the axon initial segments of granule cells, at the exact site where action potentials are preferentially initiated, which endowed these neurons with increased excitability. Taken together, our data suggest a key role of NKCC1 in NEA in the DG.

The purpose of the present study was to characterize the properties of A-type GABA receptor (GABAA receptor) currents in human sensory neurons. Neurons were obtained from adult organ donors. GABAA currents were recorded in isolated neurons. Both large inactivating low-affinity currents and smaller persistent high-affinity currents were present in all of the 129 neurons studied from 15 donors. The kinetics of human GABAA currents were slower than those in rat sensory neurons. GABA currents were completely blocked by bicuculline (10 μM), and persistent currents were activated by the δ-subunit-preferring agonist, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridine-3-ol (THIP). The GABA current equilibrium potential was ∼20 mV more hyperpolarized than in rat neurons. Both low- and high-affinity currents were increased by inflammatory mediators but via different second messenger pathways. These results highlight potentially important species differences in the properties of ion channels present in their native environment and suggest the use of human sensory neurons may be a valuable tool to test compounds prior to use in humans.

AB  - Abstract
Maladaptive plasticity within the dorsal horn (DH) of the spinal cord is a key substrate for development of neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury. Advances in genetic engineering, tracing techniques and opto-genetics are leading to a much better understanding of the complex circuitry of the spinal DH and the radical changes evoked in such circuitry by nerve injury. These changes can be viewed at multiple levels including: synaptic remodeling including enhanced excitatory and reduced inhibitory drive, morphological and electrophysiological changes which are observed both to primary afferent inputs as well as DH neurons, and ultimately circuit-level rewiring which leads to altered connectivity and aberrant processing of sensory inputs in the DH. The DH should not be seen in isolation but is subject to important descending modulation from the brainstem, which is further dysregulated by nerve injury. Understanding which changes relate to specific disease-states is essential, and recent work has aimed to stratify patient populations in a mechanistic fashion. In this review we will discuss how such pathophysiological mechanisms may lead to the distressing sensory phenomena experienced by patients suffering neuropathic pain, and the relationship of such mechanisms to current and potential future treatment modalities.

AB  - Abstract
Maternal diabetes during pregnancy may increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in the offspring by increasing inflammation. A major source of inflammatory signaling observed in diabetes is activation of the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), and increased RAGE expression has been reported in psychiatric disorders. Thus, we sought to examine whether maternal diabetes creates a proinflammatory state, triggered largely by RAGE signaling, that alters normal brain development and behavior of the offspring. We tested this hypothesis in rats using the streptozotocin (STZ; 50 mg/kg; i.p.) model of diabetes induced during mid-pregnancy. Following STZ treatment, we observed a significant increase in RAGE protein expression in the forebrain of the offspring (postnatal day 1). Data obtained from whole-cell patch clamping of hippocampal neurons in cultures from the offspring of STZ-treated dams revealed a striking increase in excitability. When tested in a battery of behavioral tasks in early adulthood, the offspring of STZ-treated dams had significantly lower prepulse inhibition, reduced anxiety-like behavior, and altered object-place preference when compared to control offspring. In an operant-based strategy set-shifting task, STZ offspring did not differ from controls on an initial visual discrimination or reversal learning but took significantly longer to shift to a new strategy (i.e., set-shift). Insulin replacement with an implantable pellet in the dams reversed the effects of maternal diabetes on RAGE expression, hippocampal excitability, prepulse inhibition and object-place memory, but not anxiety-like behavior or set-shifting. Taken together, these results suggest that chronic maternal hyperglycemia alters normal hippocampal development and behavior of the offspring, effects that may be mediated by increased RAGE signaling in the fetal brain.

AB  - Abstract
Background: Expression of the neuronal membrane glycoprotein M6a (GPM6A), the proteolipid protein (PLP/DM20) family member, is downregulated in the hippocampus of chronically stressed animals. Its neuroplastic function involves a role in neurite formation, filopodium outgrowth and synaptogenesis through an unknown mechanism. Disruptions in neuroplasticity mechanisms have been shown to play a significant part in the etiology of depression. Thus, the current investigation examined whether GPM6A expression is also altered in human depressed brain. Methods: Expression levels and coexpression patterns of GPM6A, GPM6B, and PLP1 (two other members of PLP/DM20 family) as well as of the neuroplasticity-related genes identified to associate with GPM6A were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in postmortem samples from the hippocampus (n = 18) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (n = 25) of depressed suicide victims and compared with control subjects (hippocampus n = 18; PFC n = 25). Neuroplasticity-related proteins that form complexes with GPM6A were identified by coimmunoprecipitation technique followed by mass spectrometry. Results: Results indicated transcriptional downregulation of GPM6A and GPM6B in the hippocampus of depressed suicides. The expression level of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CAMK2A) and coronin1A (CORO1A) was also significantly decreased. Subsequent analysis of coexpression patterns demonstrated coordinated gene expression in the hippocampus and in the PFC indicating that the function of these genes might be coregulated in the human brain. However, in the brain of depressed suicides this coordinated response was disrupted. Conclusions: Disruption of coordinated gene expression as well as abnormalities in GPM6A and GPM6B expression and expression of the components of GPM6A complexes were detected in the brain of depressed suicides.

AB  - Abstract
Large cohort studies have revealed a close relationship between cognitive impairment and cardiovascular diseases, although the mechanism underlying this relationship remains incompletely understood. In this study, using a transgenic (Tg) mouse model of cardiac-specific over-expression of microRNA-1-2 (miR-1-2), we observed that microRNA-1 (miR-1) levels were increased not only in the heart but also in the hippocampus and blood, whereas its levels did not change in the skeletal muscle of Tg mice compared with age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. Six-month-old Tg mice showed cognitive impairment compared with age-matched WT mice, as assessed using the Morris Water Maze test. The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level and cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation were also significantly reduced in the hippocampi of the Tg mice, as evaluated by Western blot. Further examination showed that BDNF protein expression was down- or up-regulated by miR-1 over-expression or inhibition, respectively, and was unchanged by binding site mutations or miRNA-masks for the 3′UTR of Bdnf, indicating that this gene is a potential target of miR-1. Knockdown of miR-1 by hippocampal stereotaxic injection of an anti-miR-1 oligonucleotide fragment carried by a lentivirus vector (lenti-pre-AMO-miR-1) led to up-regulation of BDNF expression and prevented the reduction in cognitive performance in the Tg mice without affecting cardiac function. Our findings demonstrate that cardiac over-expression of miR-1 also induces behavioral abnormalities that may be associated, at least in part, with the down-regulation of BDNF expression in the hippocampus. This study definitely contributes to the understanding of the relationship between cardiovascular disease and cognitive impairment.

AB  - Abstract
The insular cortex in rat is a longitudinal strip that runs along the rostral half of the rhinal fissure. The previous studies showed connections between the posterior insular cortex (PIC) and some major cardiovascular centers. Based on the stimulation site, electrical or chemical stimulation of the PIC induced an increase or a decrease in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). There is no report of simultaneous cardiovascular and single-unit recording microinjection of Glut in the PIC. In this study, l-glutamate was microinjected into the PIC of urethane anesthetized rats and arterial pressure, HR and single-unit responses were recorded simultaneously. Also the response of the neurons to baroreceptor activation was explored. Glut produced five types of long oscillatory, pressor, depressor, bradycardic and tachycardic cardiovascular responses, with no association between pressure and HR responses. We also observed five single-unit responses, consisting of short excitatory, long oscillatory, excitatory, inhibitory and mixed responses. There was an association between oscillation in BP and in single-unit response. There were some differences between the two sides especially for single-unit responses.

In conclusion, there were five types of cardiovascular and five types of single-unit responses, to Glut microinjection into PIC, from which three types were correlated. The left side of the PIC is involved more in the cardiovascular functions. These data along with the fact that most recorded neurons responded to baroreceptor activation, might imply the presence of feedback systems in the PIC, producing irregularity in BP and HR.

AB  - Abstract
Absence seizures are known to result from disturbances within the cortico-thalamocortical network, which remains partially synchronous under normal conditions but switches to a state of hypersynchronicity and hyperexcitability during absence seizures. There is evidence to suggest that impaired GABAergic inhibitory function within the thalamus could contribute to the generation of hypersynchronous oscillations in some animal models of absence epilepsy. Recently, we demonstrated region-specific alterations in the tissue expression level of GABAA receptors (GABAARs) α1 and β2 subunits within the thalamus of the stargazer mouse model of absence epilepsy. In the present study we investigated whether changes in these subunits also occur at synapses in the ventral posterior (VP) complex where they are components of phasic GABAAR receptors. Postembedding immunogold cytochemistry and electron microscopy were used to analyze the relative synaptic expression of α1 and β2 subunits in the VP thalamic region in epileptic stargazer mice compared to their non-epileptic littermates. We show that there is a significant increase in expression of α1 and β2 subunits (53.6% and 45.8%, respectively) at synapses in the VP region of stargazers, indicative of an increase in phasic GABAARs at thalamocortical (TC) relay neurons. Furthermore, we investigated whether tissue expression of GABAAR subunits α4 and δ, which constitute part of tonic GABAARs in the VP region, is altered in the stargazer mouse. Semi-quantitative Western blotting showed a significant increase in GABAAR α4 and δ subunits in the VP region of stargazer thalamus, which would indicate an increase in tonic GABAAR expression. Our findings show that there are changes in the levels of both phasic and tonic GABAARs in the VP thalamus; altered GABAergic inhibition within the VP could be one of many mechanisms contributing to the generation of absence seizures in this model.

AB  - Abstract
Transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) is activated by innocuous cool and noxious cold and plays a crucial role in cold-induced acute pain and pain hypersensitivity. To help understand the mechanism of TRPM8-mediated cold perception under normal and pathologic conditions, we used light microscopic immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis in mice expressing a genetically encoded axonal tracer in TRPM8-positive (+) neurons. We investigated the coexpression of TRPM8 and vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) and VGLUT2 in the trigeminal ganglion (TG) and the dental pulp before and after inducing pulpal inflammation.

Many TRPM8+ neurons in the TG and axons in the dental pulp expressed VGLUT2, while none expressed VGLUT1. TRPM8+ axons were dense in the pulp horn and peripheral pulp and also frequently observed in the dentinal tubules. Following pulpal inflammation, the proportion of VGLUT2+ and of VGLUT2+/TRPM8+ neurons increased significantly, whereas that of TRPM8+ neurons remained unchanged.

Our findings suggest the existence of VGLUT2 (but not VGLUT1)-mediated glutamate signaling in TRPM8+ neurons possibly underlying the cold-induced acute pain and hypersensitivity to cold following pulpal inflammation.

AB  - Abstract
Maternal immune activation can result in different behavioral abnormalities and brain dysfunction, depending on the nature of the inflammogen and the timing of the challenge. Few studies report the possible link between prenatal exposure to inflammation and mood disorders. Here we aimed to evaluate the effects of a single low lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection to the dam at gestational day 9 on the offspring behavior and hippocampal function. We found that mice exposed to LPS show anxiety- and depression-related behaviors. Specifically, we found that animals prenatally exposed to LPS avoided the open arms of an elevated plus maze, the center of an open field and the lit side of a light/dark box, and they spent more time immobile in both the forced swimming and tail suspension tests, when compared with offspring of saline-injected dams. In addition, LPS mice had reduced serotonin and noradrenaline levels in the hippocampus and diminished Reelin immunoreactivity in the dentate gyrus, while their adult hippocampal neurogenesis was not affected. Results presented here support specific long-term effects of the response to a bacterial immunogen early in pregnancy, as opposed to different effects previously reported of viral immunogens and/or responses in late pregnancy. Our work adds to recent reports and stresses the relevance of considering prenatal exposure to a maternal immune response as a risk factor for mood disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Dysfunctional sensory gating has been proposed to result in the generation of phantom perceptions. In agreement, it has been recently suggested that tinnitus, a phantom perception of sound commonly associated with hearing loss, is the result of a breakdown of circuitry involving the limbic system and the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) of the thalamus. In humans with tinnitus, structural changes and abnormal activity have been found to occur in the auditory pathway as well as parts of the limbic system such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, at present, no studies have been conducted on the influence of the NAc on the MGN. We investigated the functional connectivity between the NAc and MGN single neurons. Bipolar electrical stimulation was delivered to the NAc while recording single neuron activity in MGN in anesthetized Wistar rats. Histological analysis was used to confirm placement of electrodes. NAc electrical stimulation generally decreased spontaneous firing rates in MGN neurons and, in a limited number of neurons, caused an increase in firing rate. This suggests that NAc can modulate the activity of auditory neurons in the MGN and may play a role in the development of tinnitus.

Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder of unknown etiology. Autopsy findings, genetics, retrospective studies, and molecular imaging all suggest a role for inflammation in the neurodegenerative process. However, relatively little is understood about the causes and implications of neuroinflammation in PD. Understanding how inflammation arises in PD, in particular the activation state of cells of the innate immune system, may provide an exciting opportunity for novel neuroprotective therapeutics. We analyze the evidence of immune system involvement in PD susceptibility, specifically in the context of M1 and M2 activation states. Tracking and modulating these activation states may provide new insights into both PD etiology and therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Abstract
Evidences suggest protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε) activation is involved in both inflammatory and neuropathic pains. We have previously shown that tetracyclic triterpene euphol produces antinociception in different models of persistent pain, an action associated with its anti-inflammatory properties. Among these properties are the cannabinoid system activation and different PKC isozymes modulation. Herein, we sought to explore the potential role of PKCε modulation on euphol antinociceptive effect, in inflammatory and neuropathic pain models, in rodents. Also, we investigated further mechanisms associated with euphol effects. Oral treatment with euphol (30 mg/kg) prevented the putative effect of PGE2-induced acute and persistent mechanical hypersensitivity in mice and rats, respectively. In the PGE2-induced acute mechanical hypersensitivity euphol promoted an inhibitory effect similar to a PKCε inhibitor peptide. Likewise, in rats it prevented the mechanical hypersensitivity induced by a PKCε activator. Conversely, euphol effectiveness was not observed in a cAMP/PKA-induced mechanical hypersensitivity in mice. Single (1 h prior) or repeated (twice daily during 3 or 13 days) treatments with euphol ameliorated painful peripheral neuropathy induced by paclitaxel and also the mechanical hypersensitivity induced by B16F10 melanoma cells injection, in mice. Additionally, in both inflammatory and neuropathic pain models, euphol consistently prevented PKCε up-regulation, as well as, inhibited the up-regulation of PKCε-activated intracellular pathways; namely nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) and cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2). The present results suggest the antinociceptive effect on persistent pain caused by euphol is likely dependent on the inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediators modulated by PKCε.

AB  - Abstract
N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) have been known to be regulated by various receptor tyrosine kinases. Activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) specifically increases NMDAR-mediated currents and enhances long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. However, the mechanism through which EGFR regulates NMDARs remains to be elucidated. In this study we found that EGFR was highly expressed in the hippocampus and mainly localized in the non-synaptic region including the soma and neurites of cultured hippocampal neurons. EGFR activation led to an increase in ifenprodil-sensitive NMDAR currents. Consistent with this, we also observed that surface expression of GluN2B-containing NMDAR was upregulated. Our biochemical data from hippocampal slices and hippocampal cultured neurons demonstrated that EGF treatment in vitro significantly increased phosphorylation of the GluN2B subunit at Y1472 with a coincidental activation of Src family kinases (SFKs). EGFR blockade with a specific antagonist BIBX-1382 attenuated an increase of GluN2B in the postsynaptic density during high-frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced LTP. Moreover, BIBX blockade significantly impaired HFS-induced LTP. In conclusion, our findings suggest that EGFR signaling upregulates NMDARs through modification of the GluN2B subunit, and is required for HFS-induced LTP in the hippocampus.

AB  - Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a well-characterized neurological disorder with regard to its neuropathological and symptomatic appearance. At the genetic level, mutations of particular genes, e.g. Parkin and DJ-1, were found in human hereditary PD with early onset.

Neurotransmitter receptors constitute decisive elements in neural signal transduction. Furthermore, since they are often altered in neurological and psychiatric diseases, receptors have been successful targets for pharmacological agents. However, the consequences of PD-associated gene mutations on the expression of transmitter receptors are largely unknown.

Therefore, we studied the expression of 16 different receptor binding sites of the neurotransmitters glutamate, GABA, acetylcholine, adrenaline, serotonin, dopamine and adenosine by means of quantitative receptor autoradiography in Parkin and DJ-1 knockout mice. These knockout mice exhibit electrophysiological and behavioral deficits, but do not show the typical dopaminergic cell loss.

We demonstrated differential changes of binding site densities in eleven brain regions. Most prominently, we found an up-regulation of GABAB and kainate receptor densities in numerous cortical areas of Parkin and DJ-1 knockout mice, as well as increased NMDA but decreased AMPA receptor densities in different brain regions of the Parkin knockout mice. The alterations of three different glutamate receptor types may indicate the potential relevance of the glutamatergic system in the pathogenesis of PD. Furthermore, the cholinergic M1, M2 and nicotinic receptors as well as the adrenergic α2 and the adenosine A2A receptors showed differentially increased densities in Parkin and DJ-1 knockout mice.

Taken together, knockout of the PD-associated genes Parkin or DJ-1 results in differential changes of neurotransmitter receptor densities, highlighting a possible role of altered non-dopaminergic, and in particular of glutamatergic neurotransmission in PD pathogenesis.

Previous studies have shown that nitric oxide can induce cysteine S-nitrosylation of total protein in synaptosomes, suggesting that nitric oxide may contribute to the regulation of synaptic protein function. Vesicular neurotransmitter transporters pack neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles and play an important role in neurotransmission. In the central nervous system, vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) is responsible for the uptake of monoamines, vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) is responsible for the uptake of acetylcholine, while vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 (VGLUT1 and VGLUT2) are responsible for the uptake of glutamate. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of cysteine S-nitrosylation in the regulation of these vesicular neurotransmitter transporters. Using the biotin switch assay followed by avidin precipitation and immunoblotting we found that the nitric oxide donor nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) not only increased total cysteine S-nitrosylation, but also increased cysteine S-nitrosylation of VMAT2, VAChT, VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in the mouse brain. Further, GSNO also decreased the vesicular uptake of [3H]dopamine, [3H]acetylcholine and [3H]glutamate. Our studies suggest that the cysteine S-nitrosylation may play an important role in the regulation of vesicular neurotransmitter transport.

AB  - Abstract
It is well known that estrogen exerts neuroprotective effect against various neuronal damages. However, the estrogen receptor (ER) that mediates estrogen neuroprotection has not been well established. In this study, we investigated the potential receptor that mediates estrogen neuroprotection and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was chosen as an agent in our study to mimic free radicals that are often involved in the pathogenesis of many degenerative diseases. We found that in human SY5Y and IMR-32 cells, the estrogen neuroprotection against H2O2 toxicity was abrogated by knockdown of a variant of estrogen receptor-α, ER-α36. We also studied the rapid estrogen signaling mediated by ER-α36 in neuroprotective effect and found the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK1/2 signaling mediated by ER-α36 is involved in estrogen neuroprotection. We also found that GPER, an orphan G protein–coupled receptor, is not involved in ER-α36-mediated rapid estrogen response. Our study thus demonstrates that ER-α36-mediated rapid estrogen signaling is involved in the neuroprotection activity of estrogen against oxidative toxicity.

AB  - Abstract
Receptor binding studies have shown that the density of mu opioid receptors (MORs) in the basolateral amygdala is among the highest in the brain. Activation of these receptors in the basolateral amygdala is critical for stress-induced analgesia, memory consolidation of aversive events, and stress adaptation. Despite the importance of MORs in these stress-related functions, little is known about the neural circuits that are modulated by amygdalar MORs. In the present investigation light and electron microscopy combined with immunohistochemistry was used to study the expression of MORs in the anterior basolateral nucleus (BLa). At the light microscopic level, light to moderate MOR-immunoreactivity (MOR-ir) was observed in a small number of cell bodies of nonpyramidal interneurons and in a small number of processes and puncta in the neuropil. At the electron microscopic level most MOR-ir was observed in dendritic shafts, dendritic spines, and axon terminals. MOR-ir was also observed in the Golgi apparatus of the cell bodies of pyramidal neurons (PNs) and interneurons. Some of the MOR-positive (MOR+) dendrites were spiny, suggesting that they belonged to PNs, while others received multiple asymmetrical synapses typical of interneurons. The great majority of MOR+ axon terminals (80%) that formed synapses made asymmetrical (excitatory) synapses; their main targets were spines, including some that were MOR+. The main targets of symmetrical (inhibitory and/or neuromodulatory) synapses were dendritic shafts, many of which were MOR+, but some of these terminals formed synapses with somata or spines. All of our observations were consistent with the few electrophysiological studies which have been performed on MOR activation in the basolateral amygdala. Collectively, these findings suggest that MORs may be important for filtering out weak excitatory inputs to PNs, allowing only strong inputs or synchronous inputs to influence pyramidal neuronal firing.

AB  - Abstract
Persistent muscle pain is a common and disabling symptom for which available treatments have limited efficacy. Since tetrodotoxin (TTX) displays a marked antinociceptive effect in models of persistent cutaneous pain, we tested its local antinociceptive effect in rat models of muscle pain induced by inflammation, ergonomic injury and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. While local injection of TTX (0.03–1 μg) into the gastrocnemius muscle did not affect the mechanical nociceptive threshold in naïve rats, exposure to the inflammogen carrageenan produced a marked muscle mechanical hyperalgesia, which was dose-dependently inhibited by TTX. This antihyperalgesic effect was still significant at 24 h. TTX also displayed a robust antinociceptive effect on eccentric exercise-induced mechanical hyperalgesia in the gastrocnemius muscle, a model of ergonomic pain. Finally, TTX produced a small but significant inhibition of neuropathic muscle pain induced by systemic administration of the cancer chemotherapeutic agent oxaliplatin. These results indicate that TTX-sensitive sodium currents in nociceptors play a central role in diverse states of skeletal muscle nociceptive sensitization, supporting the suggestion that therapeutic interventions based on TTX may prove useful in the treatment of muscle pain.

AB  - Abstract
The gene encoding the neural cell adhesion molecule Cntn5 (a.k.a. NB-2) has been put forward as a candidate in neurodevelopmental disorders, like autism spectrum disorder (ASD), by recent genetic findings. Little is known about the expression pattern and function of the gene, and its functional involvement in brain development has remained elusive. So far, most research has focused on its early postnatal expression in the auditory system, where the absence of Cntn5 causes abnormal responses to acoustic stimuli and a decrease in fiber density. The current study shows that the Cntn5 gene is expressed in forebrain structures during embryonic development, starting at E15.5, and that it continues to be expressed into adulthood. Sites of strong expression included the thalamus, the caudate putamen (CPu) and to a lesser extent layer Va of the cerebral cortex. Cntn5-positive thalamic nuclei include the laterodorsal (LD), ventrolateral (VL) and posterior group (Po), which contain glutamatergic neurons. Visualization of the expression pattern through the Tau-LacZ fusion protein coded by an insert in the Cntn5 gene, demonstrated that Cntn5-positive nuclei of the thalamus project to the cortex, based on co-localization with thalamocortical markers L1 and Calretinin. These results indicate that the cell adhesion functions of Cntn5 are exploited for circuit formation and connectivity in early development and for synaptic maintenance during adulthood. Subtle alterations in the formation of the thalamocortical circuit may contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as ASD.

AB  - Abstract
Tinnitus often occurs after exposure to loud noise. This raises the question of whether repeated exposure to noise increases the risk of developing tinnitus. We thus studied tinnitus development after repeated acoustic overstimulation using startle and auditory brainstem-response techniques applied to Mongolian gerbils. Noise with bandwidths ranging from 0.25 up to 0.5 oct were used for repeated acoustic overstimulation. Auditory brainstem response measurements revealed similar threshold shifts in both groups of up to about 30 dB directly after the acoustic overstimulation. We identified an upper limit in threshold values, which was independent of the baseline values before the noise exposure. Several weeks after the acoustic overstimulation, animals with the noise bandwidth of 0.25 oct showed a permanent threshold shift, while animals of the group with the 0.5-oct noise band featured only a temporary threshold shift. We thus conclude that the threshold shift directly after noise exposure cannot be used as an indicator for the upcoming threshold level several weeks later. By using behavioral measurements, we investigated the frequency-dependent development of tinnitus-related changes in both groups and one group with 1-oct noise bandwidth. The number of animals that show tinnitus-related changes was highest in animals that received noise with the bandwidth 0.5 oct. This number was, in contrast to the number of animals in the 0.25-oct bandwidth, not significantly increased after repeated overstimulation. The frequency distribution of tinnitus-related changes ranged from 4 to 20 kHz. In the group with the narrow-band noise (0.25 oct) changes center at one frequency range from 10 to 12 kHz. In the group with the broader noise band (0.5 oct), however, two peaks at 8–10 kHz and at 16–18 kHz were found, which suggests that different mechanisms underlie the tinnitus development.

AB  - Abstract
NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate-gated ion channels widely expressed in the central nervous system (CNS) and endowed with unique biophysical, pharmacological and signaling properties. These receptors are best known for their critical roles in synaptic plasticity and their implications in a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Since their discovery three decades ago, NMDARs have been thoroughly studied as components of postsynaptic excitatory potentials. Early on, however, both anatomical and physiological evidence pointed out to the existence of NMDARs away from the postsynaptic density. Some were found to be extrasynaptic, while others seemed to be specifically present at presynaptic (i.e. axonal) elements. Although presynaptic NMDARs (preNMDARs) were at first thought to be exceptional, there is now strong evidence that these receptors are relatively widespread in the CNS and regulate synaptic strength in specific sets of synapses. In this review, we compile our current knowledge on preNMDARs, presenting their anatomical distribution, developmental regulation, subunit composition, activation mechanisms as well as their downstream effects on synapse function. Contentious issues that animate the field are also discussed. Finally, particular emphasis is put on the molecular and cellular diversity of preNMDARs which translates into a variety of effects, both short- and long-term, on synaptic efficacy. Overshadowed by their postsynaptic counterparts, preNMDARs are progressively emerging as important regulators of neuronal signaling.

AB  - Abstract
This study aimed to evaluate the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on learning and memory in a rat model of vascular dementia (VaD) and to analyze the associated mechanisms. Bilateral carotid artery occlusion (2-VO) was used to establish a rat model of VaD. High-frequency (5 Hz) rTMS was performed on rats for four weeks. Spatial learning and memory abilities were evaluated using the Morris water maze (MWM), and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus was assessed via long-term potentiation (LTP). Hippocampal expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and three subunits of the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR), NR1, NR2A and NR2B, was analyzed by Western blotting. Compared with the VaD group, escape latency was decreased (P &lt; 0.05) and the time spent in the target quadrant and the percentage of swimming distance within that quadrant were increased (P &lt; 0.05) in the rTMS group. LTP at hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses was enhanced by rTMS (P &lt; 0.05). VEGF expression was up-regulated following 2-VO and was further increased by rTMS (P &lt; 0.05). BDNF, NR1 and NR2B expression was decreased in the VaD group and increased by rTMS (P &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences in NR2A expression among the three groups. These results suggest that rTMS improved learning and memory in the VaD model rats via the up-regulation of VEGF, BDNF and NMDARs. In addition, NR2B may be more important than NR2A for LTP induction in the hippocampus during rTMS treatment of VaD.

AB  - Abstract
The pervasive reach of the inflammatory system is evidenced by its involvement in numerous disease states. Cardiovascular disease, marked by high levels of circulating inflammatory mediators, affects an estimated 83.6 million Americans. Similarly, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) produces a paradoxical state of generalized immune activity despite widespread immunosuppression, and affects 35 million people worldwide. Patients living with HIV (PLWH) suffer from inflammatory conditions, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), at a rate exceeding the general population. In this combined disease state, immune mechanisms that are common to both CVD and HIV may interact to generate a progressive condition that contributes to the exacerbated pathogenesis of the other to the net effect of damage to the brain. In this review, we will outline inflammatory cell mediators that promote cardiovascular risk factors and disease initiation and detail how HIV-related proteins may accelerate this process. Finally, we examine the extent to which these comorbid conditions act as parallel, perpendicular, or progressive sequela of events to generate a neurodegenerative environment, and consider potential strategies that can be implemented to reduce the burden of CVD and inflammation in PLWH.

Aim of this study was to verify whether the topological organization of human brain functional networks is different for males and females in resting state EEGs. Undirected and weighted brain networks were computed by eLORETA lagged linear connectivity in 130 subjects (59 males and 71 females) within each hemisphere and in four resting state networks (Attentional Network (AN), Frontal Network (FN), Sensorimotor Network (SN), Default Mode Network (DMN)). We found that small-world (SW) architecture in the left hemisphere Frontal network presented differences in both delta and alpha band, in particular lower values in delta and higher in alpha 2 in males respect to females while in the right hemisphere differences were found in lower values of SW in males respect to females in gamma Attentional, delta Sensorimotor and delta and gamma DMNs. Gender small-worldness differences in some of resting state networks indicated that there are specific brain differences in the EEG rhythms when the brain is in the resting-state condition. These specific regions could be considered related to the functions of behavior and cognition and should be taken into account both for research on healthy and brain diseased subjects.

AB  - Abstract
The administration of cholinergic agonists like pilocarpine intraperitoneally (i.p.) or carbachol intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) induces water, but non significant hypertonic NaCl intake. These treatments also produce pressor responses, which may inhibit sodium intake. Noradrenaline (NOR) acting on α2-adrenoceptors in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) deactivates inhibitory mechanisms increasing fluid depletion-induced sodium intake. In the present study, we investigated: (1) water and 1.8% NaCl intake in rats treated with pilocarpine i.p. or carbachol i.c.v. combined with NOR into the LPBN; (2) if inhibitory signals from cardiovascular receptors are blocked by NOR in the LPBN. Male Holtzman rats with stainless steel guide-cannulas implanted in the lateral ventricle and bilaterally in the LPBN were used. Bilateral injections of NOR (80 nmol/0.2 μl) into the LPBN decreased water intake (0.8 ± 0.3, vs. saline (SAL): 2.9 ± 0.3 ml/180 min) induced by pilocarpine (1 mg/kg of body weight) i.p., without changing 1.8% NaCl intake (0.8 ± 2.4, vs. SAL: 0.5 ± 0.3 ml/180 min). Prazosin (1 mg/kg of body weight) i.p. blocked pressor responses and increased water and 1.8% NaCl intake (6.3 ± 1.7 and 14.7 ± 3.5 ml/180 min, respectively) in rats treated with pilocarpine combined with NOR into the LPBN. Prazosin i.p. also increased 1.8% NaCl intake in rats treated with carbachol i.c.v combined with NOR into the LPBN. The results suggest that different signals inhibit sodium intake in rats treated with cholinergic agonists, among them those produced by increases of arterial pressure that are not efficiently deactivated by NOR acting in the LPBN.

Gentamicin treatment induces hair cell death or survival in the inner ear. Besides the well-known toxic effects, the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt (PI3K/Akt) pathway was found to be involved in cell protection. After gentamicin application, the spatiotemporal expression patterns of Akt and its activated form (p-Akt) were determined in male guinea pigs. A single dose of 0.1 mL gentamicin (4 mg/ear/animal) was intratympanically injected. The auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were recorded prior to application and 1, 2 and 7 days afterward. At these three time points the cochleae (n = 10 in each case) were removed, transferred to fixative and embedded in paraffin. Seven ears were used as untreated controls. Gentamicin, Akt and p-Akt were identified immunohistochemically in various regions of the cochlea and their staining intensities were quantified on sections using digital image analysis. The application of gentamicin resulted in hearing loss with a concomitant up-regulation of Akt-expression in the organ of Corti and spiral ganglion cells and an additional activation in spiral ganglion cells. At the level of individual ears, clear intracellular correlations were found between Akt- and p-Akt-expression in the stria vascularis and interdental cells and, to a minor extent, in the spiral ligament and the organ of Corti. Furthermore, statistical evidence for the connection between gentamicin up-take and hearing loss was detected. The increase in Akt- and p-Akt-expression in the organ of Corti and spiral ganglion cells indicates a selected response of the cochlea against gentamicin toxicity.

AB  - Abstract
Oxidative stress is a major risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that has been suggested to be the trigger of AD pathology. However, whether oxidative damage precedes and contributes directly to the intracellular accumulation of beta amyloid 1–42 (βA42) peptide remains a matter of debate.

Chronic exposure to low doses of ozone similar to the levels during a day of high pollution in México City causes a state of oxidative stress that elicits progressive neurodegeneration in the hippocampi of rats.

Several reports have demonstrated that the mitochondria are among the first organelles to be affected by oxidative stress and βA42 toxicity and act as sites of the accumulation of βA42, which affects energy metabolism. However, the mechanisms related to the neurodegeneration process and organelle damage that occur in conditions of chronic exposure to low doses of ozone have not been demonstrated.

To analyze the effect of chronic ozone chronic exposure on changes in the production and accumulation of the βA42 and βA40 peptides in the mitochondria of hippocampal neurons of rats exposed to ozone, we examined the mitochondrial expression levels of Presenilins 1 and 2 and ADAM10 to detect changes related to the oxidative stress caused by low doses of ozone (0.25 ppm).

The results revealed significant accumulations of βA42 peptide in the mitochondrial fractions on days 60 and 90 of ozone exposure along with reductions in beta amyloid 1–40 accumulation, significant overexpressions of Pres2 and significant reductions in ADAM10 expression. Beta amyloid immunodetection revealed that there were some intracellular deposits of βA42 and that βA42 and the mitochondrial markers OPA1 and COX1 colocalized.

These results indicate that the time of exposure to ozone and the accumulation of βA42 in the mitochondria of the hippocampal cells of rats were correlated. Our results suggest that the accumulation of the βA42 peptide may promote mitochondrial dysfunction due to its accumulation and overproduction.

AB  - Abstract
Peripheral neuropathy is a major complication associated with diabetes and central neuropathy characterized by Alzheimer’s disease-like features in the brain is associated with increased dementia risk for patients with diabetes. Although glucose uptake into the cells of the nervous system is insulin-independent, contribution of impaired insulin support is clearly recognized to play a role, however not yet fully understood, in the development of neuropathy. In this study, we assessed the direct role of insulin on the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) of insulin-dependent type 1 diabetic rats. Fresh sciatic nerve and hippocampus from control and diabetic rats were incubated with varied ex vivo concentrations of insulin and phosphorylation levels of insulin receptor and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3β) were assessed by Western blot analysis. Both the sciatic nerve and hippocampus from type 1 diabetic rats were highly responsive to exogenous insulin with a significantly increased phosphorylation of insulin receptor and GSK3 compared to tissues from control rats. Further, sustained in vivo insulin delivery, not sufficient to restore normal blood glucose, normalized the activation of both insulin receptor and GSK3 in both PNS and CNS tissues. These results suggest that the insulin-signaling pathway is responsive to exogenous insulin in the nervous system of insulin-deficient type 1 diabetic rats and that constant insulin delivery restore normal nerve function and may protect PNS and CNS from damage.

AB  - Abstract
Neuroinflammation has long been known as an accompanying pathology of Alzheimer’s disease. Microglia surrounding amyloid plaques in the brain of Auguste D were described in the original publication of Alois Alzheimer. It is only quite recently, however, that we have a more complete appreciation for the diverse roles of neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s. While gaps in our knowledge remain, and conflicting data are abound in the field, our understanding of the complexities and heterogeneous functions of the inflammatory response in Alzheimer’s is vastly improved. This review article will discuss some of the roles of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer’s disease, in particular, how understanding heterogeneity in the individual inflammatory response can be used in therapeutic development and as a mechanism of personalizing our treatment of the disease.

AB  - Abstract
There are profound, yet incompletely understood, sex differences in the neurogenic regulation of blood pressure. Both corticotropin signaling and glutamate receptor plasticity, which differ between males and females, are known to play important roles in the neural regulation of blood pressure. However, the relationship between hypertension and glutamate plasticity in corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-receptive neurons in brain cardiovascular regulatory areas, including the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), is not understood. In the present study, we used dual-label immuno-electron microscopy to analyze sex differences in slow-pressor angiotensin II (AngII) hypertension with respect to the subcellular distribution of the obligatory NMDA glutamate receptor subunit 1 (GluN1) subunit of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) in the RVLM and PVN. Studies were conducted in mice expressing the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) under the control of the CRF type 1 receptor (CRF1) promoter (i.e., CRF1–EGFP reporter mice). By light microscopy, GluN1-immunoreactivity (ir) was found in CRF1–EGFP neurons of the RVLM and PVN. Moreover, in both regions tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was found in CRF1–EGFP neurons. In response to AngII, male mice showed an elevation in blood pressure that was associated with an increase in the proportion of GluN1 on presumably functional areas of the plasma membrane (PM) in CRF1–EGFP dendritic profiles in the RVLM. In female mice, AngII was neither associated with an increase in blood pressure nor an increase in PM GluN1 in the RVLM. Unlike the RVLM, AngII-mediated hypertension had no effect on GluN1 localization in CRF1–EGFP dendrites in the PVN of either male or female mice. These studies provide an anatomical mechanism for sex-differences in the convergent modulation of RVLM catecholaminergic neurons by CRF and glutamate. Moreover, these results suggest that sexual dimorphism in AngII-induced hypertension is reflected by NMDA receptor trafficking in presumptive sympathoexcitatory neurons in the RVLM.

AB  - Abstract
Treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD) with dopamine replacement relieves symptoms of poverty of movement, but often causes drug-induced dyskinesias. Accumulating clinical and pre-clinical evidence suggests that the primary motor cortex (M1) is involved in the pathophysiology of PD and that modulating cortical activity may be a therapeutic target in PD and dyskinesia. However, surprisingly little is known about how M1 neurotransmitter tone or gene expression is altered in PD, dyskinesia or associated animal models. The present study utilized the rat unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model of PD/dyskinesia to characterize structural and functional changes taking place in M1 monoamine innervation and gene expression. 6-OHDA caused dopamine pathology in M1, although the lesion was less severe than in the striatum. Rats with 6-OHDA lesions showed a PD motor impairment and developed dyskinesia when given l-DOPA or the D1 receptor agonist, SKF81297. M1 expression of two immediate-early genes (c-Fos and ARC) was strongly enhanced by either l-DOPA or SKF81297. At the same time, expression of genes specifically involved in glutamate and GABA signaling were either modestly affected or unchanged by lesion and/or treatment. We conclude that M1 neurotransmission and signal transduction in the rat 6-OHDA model of PD/dyskinesia mirror features of human PD, supporting the utility of the model to study M1 dysfunction in PD and the elucidation of novel pathophysiological mechanisms and therapeutic targets.

AB  - Abstract
Adult attachment style (AAS) is a personality trait that affects social cognition. Behavioral data suggest that AAS influences mentalizing proficiency, i.e. the ability to predict and explain people’s behavior with reference to mental states, but the neural correlates are unknown. We here tested how the AAS dimensions “avoidance” (AV) and “anxiety” (ANX) modulate neural correlates of mentalizing.

We measured brain activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 164 healthy subjects during an interactive mentalizing paradigm (Prisoner’s Dilemma Game). AAS was assessed with the Relationship Scales Questionnaire, including the subscales AV and ANX.

Our task elicited a strong activation of the mentalizing network, including bilateral precuneus, (anterior, middle, and posterior) cingulate cortices, temporal poles, inferior frontal gyri (IFG), temporoparietal junctions, superior medial frontal gyri as well as right medial orbital frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and amygdala. We found that AV is positively and ANX negatively correlated with task-associated neural activity in the right amygdala, MFG, midcingulate cortex, and superior parietal lobule, and in bilateral IFG. These data suggest that avoidantly attached adults activate brain areas implicated in emotion regulation and cognitive control to a larger extent than anxiously attached individuals during mentalizing.

AB  - Abstract
Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are involved in a myriad of physiological processes that are mediated through the activation of cannabinoid receptors, which are ubiquitously distributed within the nervous system. One neurochemical target at which cannabinoids interact to have global effects on behavior is brain noradrenergic circuitry. We, and others, have previously shown that CB type 1 receptors (CB1r) are positioned to pre-synaptically modulate norepinephrine (NE) release in the rat frontal cortex (FC). Diacylglycerol lipase (DGL) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). While DGL-α is expressed in the FC in the rat brain, it is not known whether noradrenergic afferents target neurons expressing synthesizing enzymes for the endocannabinoid, 2-AG. In the present study, we employed high-resolution neuroanatomical approaches to better define cellular sites for interactions between noradrenergic afferents and FC neurons expressing DGL-α. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed close appositions between processes containing the norepinephrine transporter (NET) or dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DβH) and cortical neurons expressing DGL-α-immunoreactivity. Ultrastructural analysis using immunogold-silver labeling for DGL-α and immunoperoxidase labeling for NET or DβH confirmed that NET-labeled axon terminals were directly apposed to FC somata and dendritic processes that exhibited DGL-α-immunoreactivity. Finally, tissue sections were processed for immunohistochemical detection of DGL-α, CB1r and DβH. Triple label immunofluorescence revealed that CB1r and DβH were co-localized in common cellular profiles and these were in close association with DGL-α. Taken together, these data provide anatomical evidence for direct synaptic associations between noradrenergic afferents and cortical neurons exhibiting endocannabinoid synthesizing machinery.

AB  - Abstract
Despite its initial treatment as a nuisance variable, the placebo effect is now recognized as a powerful determinant of health across many different diseases and encounters. This is in light of some remarkable findings ranging from demonstrations that the placebo effect significantly modulates the response to active treatments in conditions such as pain, anxiety, Parkinson’s disease, and some surgical procedures. Here, we review pioneering studies and recent advances in behavioral, neurobiological, and genetic influences on the placebo effect. Consistent with recent conceptualizations, the placebo effect is presented as the product of a general expectancy learning mechanism in which verbal, conditioned, and social cues are centrally integrated to change behaviors and outcomes. Examples of the integration of verbal and conditioned cues, such as instructed reversal of placebo effects are also incorporated into this model. We discuss neuroimaging studies that have identified key brain regions and modulatory mechanisms underlying placebo effects using well-established behavioral paradigms. Finally, we present a synthesis of recent genetics studies on the placebo effect, highlighting a promising link between genetic variants in the dopamine, opioid, serotonin, and endocannabinoid pathways and placebo responsiveness. Greater understanding of the behavioral, neurobiological, and genetic influences on the placebo effect is critical for evaluating medical interventions and may allow health professionals to tailor and personalize interventions in order to maximize treatment outcomes in clinical settings.

AB  - Abstract
Previous reports from our lab had shown that some anti-purinergic receptor P2X4 antibodies cross-reacted with misfolded forms of mutant Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Cross-reactivity could be caused by the abnormal exposure of an epitope located in the inner hydrophobic region of SOD1 that shared structural homology with the P2X4-immunizing peptide. We had previously raised antibodies against human SOD1 epitope mimicked by the P2X4 immunizing peptide. One of these antibodies, called AJ10, was able to recognize mutant/misfolded forms of ALS-linked mutant SOD1. Here, we used the AJ10 antigen as a vaccine to target neurotoxic species of mutant SOD1 in a slow mouse model of ALS. However, the obtained results showed no improvement in life span, disease onset or weight loss in treated animals; we observed an increased microglial neuroinflammatory response and high amounts of misfolded SOD1 accumulated within spinal cord neurons after AJ10 immunization. An increase of immunoglobulin G deposits was also found due to the treatment. Finally, a significantly worse clinical evolution was displayed by an impairment on motor function as a consequence of AJ10 peptide immunization.

AB  - Abstract
The medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) is a sexually dimorphic cell group of the medial preoptic area that plays a central role in the integration of olfactory and hormonal stimuli that modulate sexually differentiated behaviors. The influence of sex steroids in these behaviors is mediated through activation of estrogen receptors (ERs), which are highly expressed in this nucleus. Little is known about the effects of progesterone (P) or the selective activation of each ER subtype on the expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in the MPN of female rats. We have addressed this subject in the current investigation by estimating, using stereological tools, the total number of MPN neurons that express ERα in rats at each phase of the estrous cycle and in ovariectomized rats treated with estradiol benzoate (EB), P or the ERα- and estrogen receptor beta (ERβ)-specific agonists. Results show that the total number of ERα-immunoreactive neurons does not change over the estrous cycle, except at proestrus when the number is reduced. A similar effect was observed after the administration of EB, but not of P. Results also show that the estradiol-induced down-regulation of the ERα is mediated by activation of both ER subtypes, and that ERβ activation leads to a reduction in the total number of ERα-immunoreactive neurons that is twice that resulting from ERα activation. Present data suggest that ERα activation triggers a sort of negative feedback mechanism in MPN neurons that reduces its own expression, which might be of importance for the regulation of estradiol-dependent physiological and behavioral responses.

AB  - Abstract
Traditionally, multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered to be a disease primarily affecting the white matter (WM). However, the development of some clinical symptoms such as cognitive impairment cannot be fully explained by the severity of WM pathology alone. During the past decades it became clear that gray matter (GM) damage of the brain is also of major importance in patients with MS. Thanks to improved magnetic resonance imaging techniques, the in vivo detection of GM pathology became possible, enabling a better understanding of the manifestation of various clinical symptoms, such as cognitive impairment. Using higher field strengths and specific sequences, detection of cortical lesions was increased. However, despite these improvements, visualization of cortical MS lesions remains difficult (only about 30–50% of histopathologically confirmed lesions can be detected at 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)). Furthermore, more research is needed to understand the exact interplay of cortical lesions, GM atrophy and WM pathology in the development of clinical symptoms. In this review, we summarize the historical background that preceded current research and provide an overview of the current knowledge on clinical consequences of GM pathology in MS in terms of disability, cognitive impairment and other clinically important signs such as epileptic seizures.

AB  - Abstract
Hippocampal circuits are among the best described networks in the mammalian brain, particularly with regard to the alterations that arise during normal aging. Decades of research indicate multiple points of vulnerability in aging neural circuits, and it has been proposed that each of these changes make a contribution to observed age-related cognitive deficits. Another view has been relatively overlooked – namely that some of these changes arise in adaptive response to protect network function in aged animals. This possibility leads to a rather different view on the biological variation of function in the brain of older individuals. Using the hippocampus as a model neural circuit we discuss how, in normally aged animals, some age-related changes may arise through processes of neural plasticity that serve to enhance network function rather than to hinder it. Conceptually disentangling the initial age-related vulnerabilities from changes that result in adaptive response will be a major challenge for the future research on brain aging. We suggest that a reformulation of how normal aging could be understood from an adaptive perspective will lead to a deeper understanding of the secrets behind successful brain aging and our recent cultural successes in facilitating these processes.

AB  - Abstract
High-intensity sound can induce seizures in susceptible animals. After repeated acoustic stimuli changes in behavioural seizure repertoire and epileptic EEG activity might be seen in recruited limbic and forebrain structures, a phenomenon known as audiogenic kindling. It is postulated that audiogenic kindling can produce synaptic plasticity events leading to the spread of epileptogenic activity to the limbic system. In order to test this hypothesis, we investigated if long-term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampal Schaffer-CA1 synapses and spatial navigation memory are altered by a repeated high-intensity sound stimulation (HISS) protocol, consisting of one-minute 120 dB broadband noise applied twice a day for 10 days, in normal Wistar rats and in audiogenic seizure-prone rats (Wistar Audiogenic Rats – WARs). After HISS all WARs exhibited midbrain seizures and 50% of these animals developed limbic recruitment, while only 26% of Wistar rats presented midbrain seizures and none of them had limbic recruitment. In naïve animals, LTP in hippocampal CA1 neurons was induced by 50- or 100-Hz high-frequency stimulation of Schaffer fibres in slices from both Wistar and WAR animals similarly. Surprisingly, HISS suppressed LTP in CA1 neurons in slices from Wistar rats that did not present any seizure, and inhibited LTP in slices from Wistar rats with only midbrain seizures. However HISS had no effect on LTP in CA1 neurons from slices of WARs. Interestingly HISS did not alter spatial navigation and memory in both strains. These findings show that repeated high-intensity sound stimulation prevent LTP of Schaffer-CA1 synapses from Wistar rats, without affecting spatial memory. This effect was not seen in hippocampi from audiogenic seizure-prone WARs. In WARs the link between auditory stimulation and hippocampal LTP seems to be disrupted which could be relevant for the susceptibility to seizures in this strain.

AB  - Abstract
Arm movement control takes advantage of multiple inputs, including those originating from the contralateral arm. In the mirror paradigm, it has been suggested that control of the unseen arm, hidden by the mirror, is facilitated by the reflection of the other, moving arm. Although proprioceptive feedback originating from the moving arm, (the image of which is reflected in the mirror), is always coupled with visual feedback in the mirror paradigm, the former has received little attention. We recently showed that the involuntary arm movement following a sustained, isometric contraction, known as the “floating arm” or “Kohnstamm phenomenon”, was adjusted to the passive-motorized displacement of the other arm. However, provision of mirror feedback, that is, the reflection in the mirror of the passively moved arm, did not add to this coupling effect. Therefore, the interlimb coupling in the mirror paradigm may to a large extent have a proprioceptive origin rather than a visual origin. The objective of the present study was to decouple mirror feedback and proprioceptive feedback from the reflected, moving arm and evaluate their respective contributions to interlimb coupling in the mirror paradigm. First (in Experiment 1, under eyes-closed conditions), we found that masking the proprioceptive afferents of the passively moved arm (by co-vibrating the antagonistic biceps and triceps muscles) suppressed the interlimb coupling between involuntary displacement of one arm and passive displacement of the other. Next (in Experiment 2), we masked proprioceptive afferents of the passively moved arm and specifically evaluated mirror feedback. We found that interlimb coupling through mirror feedback (though significant) was weaker than interlimb coupling through proprioceptive feedback. Overall, the present results show that in the mirror paradigm, proprioceptive feedback is stronger and more consistent than visual-mirror feedback in terms of the impact on interlimb coupling.

AB  - Abstract
Infection by the neurotropic agent Toxoplasma gondii alters rodent behavior and can result in neuropsychiatric symptoms in humans. Little is understood regarding the effects of infection on host neural processes but alterations to dopaminergic neurotransmission are implicated. We have previously reported elevated levels of dopamine (DA) in infected dopaminergic cells however the involvement of the host enzymes and fate of the produced DA were not defined. In order to clarify the effects of infection on host DA biosynthetic enzymes and DA packaging we examined enzyme levels and activity and DA accumulation and release in T. gondii-infected neurosecretory cells. Although the levels of the host tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and DOPA decarboxylase and AADC (DDC) did not change significantly in infected cultures, DDC was found within the parasitophorous vacuole (PV), the vacuolar compartment where the parasites reside, as well as in the host cytosol in infected dopaminergic cells. Strikingly, DDC was found within the intracellular parasite cysts in infected brain tissue. This finding could provide some explanation for observations of DA within tissue cysts in infected brain as a parasite-encoded enzyme with TH activity was also localized within tissue cysts. In contrast, cellular DA packaging appeared unchanged in single-cell microamperometry experiments and only a fraction of the increased DA was accessible to high potassium-induced release. This study provides some understanding of how this parasite produces elevated DA within dopaminergic cells without the toxic ramifications of free cytosolic DA. The mechanism for synthesis and packaging of DA by T. gondii-infected dopaminergic cells may have important implications for the effects of chronic T. gondii infection on humans and animals.

AB  - Abstract
Exacerbated hippocampal activity has been associated to critical modifications of the intracellular signaling pathways. We have investigated rapid hippocampal adaptive responses induced by maximal electroshock seizure (MES). Here, we demonstrate that abnormal and exacerbated hippocampal activity induced by MES triggers specific and temporally distinct patterns of phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC) and Akt/glycogen synthase kinase-3 (Akt/GSK-3) pathways in the mouse hippocampus. While the ERK pathway is transiently activated, the mTORC1 cascade follows a rapid inhibition followed by a transient activation. This rebound of mTORC1 activity leads to the selective phosphorylation of p70S6K, which is accompanied by an enhanced phosphorylation of the ribosomal subunit S6. In contrast, the Akt/GSK-3 pathway is weakly altered. Finally, MES triggers a rapid upregulation of several plasticity-associated genes as a consequence exacerbated hippocampal activity. The results reported in the present study are reminiscent of the one observed in other models of generalized seizures, thus defining a common molecular footprint induced by intense and aberrant hippocampal activities.

AB  - Abstract
JNK-interacting protein 3 (JIP3), also known as JNK stress-activated protein kinase-associated protein 1 (JSAP1), is a scaffold protein mainly involved in the regulation of the pro-apoptotic signaling cascade mediated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Overexpression of JIP3 in neurons in vitro has been reported to lead to accelerated activation of JNK and enhanced apoptosis response to cellular stress. However, the occurrence and the functional significance of stress-induced modulations of JIP3 levels in vivo remain elusive. In this study, we investigated the expression of JIP3 in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and in a kainic acid (KA)-induced mouse model of epileptic seizures, and determined whether down-regulation of JIP3 can decrease susceptibility to seizures and neuron damage induced by KA. We found that JIP3 was markedly increased in TLE patients and a mouse model of epileptic seizures; mice underexpressing JIP3 through lentivirus bearing LV-Letm1-RNAi showed decreased susceptibility, delayed first seizure and decreased seizure duration response to the epileptogenic properties of KA. Subsequently, a decreased activation of JNK following seizure induction was observed in mice underexpressing JIP3, which also exhibited less neuronal apoptosis in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, as assessed three days after KA administration. We also found that mice underexpressing JIP3 exhibited a delayed pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindling seizure process.

AB  - Abstract
Psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia, affect a significant percentage of the world population. These disorders are associated with educational difficulties, decreased productivity and reduced quality of life, but their underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Recently, studies have suggested that psychiatric disorders could be considered as inflammatory disorders, even though the exact mechanisms underlying this association are not known. An increase in inflammatory response and oxidative stress may lead to inflammation, which in turn can stimulate microglia in the brain. Microglial activation is roused by the M1 phenotype, which is associated with an increase in interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). On the contrary, M2 phenotype is associated with a release of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Thus, it is possible that the inflammatory response from microglial activation can contribute to brain pathology, as well as influence treatment responses. This review will highlight the role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, such as MDD, BD, schizophrenia, and autism. More specifically, the role of microglial activation and associated molecular cascades will also be discussed as a means by which these neuroinflammatory mechanisms take place, when appropriate.

AB  - Abstract
Previous contributions in younger cohorts have revealed that reallocation of cerebral resources, a crucial mechanism for working memory (WM), may be disrupted by parallel demands of background acoustic noise suppression. To date, no study has explored the impact of such disruption on brain activation in elderly individuals with or without subtle cognitive deficits. We performed a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study in 23 cases (mean age = 75.7 y.o., 16 men) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 16 elderly healthy controls (HC, mean age = 70.1 y.o., three men) using a 2-back WM task, under two distinct MRI background acoustic noise conditions (louder vs. lower noise echo-planar imaging). General linear models were used to assess brain activation as a function of group and noise.

In both groups, lower background noise is associated with increased activation of the working memory network (WMN). A decrease of the normally observed deactivation of the default mode network (DMN) is found under louder noise in both groups. Unlike HC, MCI cases also show decreased deactivation of the DMN under both louder and lower background noise. Under louder noise, this decrease is observed in anterior parts of the DMN in HC, and in the posterior cingulate cortex in MCI cases.

Our results suggest that background acoustic noise has a differential impact on WMN activation in normal aging as a function of the cognitive status. Only louder noise has a disruptive effect on the usually observed DMN deactivation during WM task performance in HC. In contrast, MCI cases show altered DMN reactivity even in the presence of lower noise.

AB  - Abstract
Increasing numbers of studies have suggested that the gut microbiota is involved in the pathophysiology of stress-related disorders. Chronic stress can cause behavioral, cognitive, biochemical, and gut microbiota aberrations. Gut bacteria can communicate with the host through the microbiota–gut–brain axis (which mainly includes the immune, neuroendocrine, and neural pathways) to influence brain and behavior. It is hypothesized that administration of probiotics can improve chronic-stress-induced depression. In order to examine this hypothesis, the chronic restraint stress depression model was established in this study. Adult specific pathogen free (SPF) Sprague–Dawley rats were subjected to 21 days of restraint stress followed by behavioral testing (including the sucrose preference test (SPT), elevated-plus maze test, open-field test (OFT), object recognition test (ORT), and object placement test (OPT)) and biochemical analysis. Supplemental Lactobacillus helveticus NS8 was provided every day during stress until the end of experiment, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram (CIT) served as a positive control. Results showed that L. helveticus NS8 improved chronic restraint stress-induced behavioral (anxiety and depression) and cognitive dysfunction, showing an effect similar to and better than that of CIT. L. helveticus NS8 also resulted in lower plasma corticosterone (CORT) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, higher plasma interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels, restored hippocampal serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) levels, and more hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression than in chronic stress rats. Taken together, these results indicate an anti-depressant effect of L. helveticus NS8 in rats subjected to chronic restraint stress depression and that this effect could be due to the microbiota–gut–brain axis. They also suggest the therapeutic potential of L. helveticus NS8 in stress-related and possibly other kinds of depression.

AB  - Abstract
People often “mind wander” during everyday tasks, temporarily losing track of time, place, or current task goals. In laboratory-based tasks, mind wandering is often associated with performance decrements in behavioral variables and changes in neural recordings. Such empirical associations provide descriptive accounts of mind wandering – how it affects ongoing task performance – but fail to provide true explanatory accounts – why it affects task performance. In this perspectives paper, we consider mind wandering as a neural state or process that affects the parameters of quantitative cognitive process models, which in turn affect observed behavioral performance. Our approach thus uses cognitive process models to bridge the explanatory divide between neural and behavioral data. We provide an overview of two general frameworks for developing a model-based cognitive neuroscience of mind wandering. The first approach uses neural data to segment observed performance into a discrete mixture of latent task-related and task-unrelated states, and the second regresses single-trial measures of neural activity onto structured trial-by-trial variation in the parameters of cognitive process models. We discuss the relative merits of the two approaches, and the research questions they can answer, and highlight that both approaches allow neural data to provide additional constraint on the parameters of cognitive models, which will lead to a more precise account of the effect of mind wandering on brain and behavior. We conclude by summarizing prospects for mind wandering as conceived within a model-based cognitive neuroscience framework, highlighting the opportunities for its continued study and the benefits that arise from using well-developed quantitative techniques to study abstract theoretical constructs.

AB  - Abstract
The perception of tool–object pairs involves understanding their action-relationships (affordances). Here, we sought to evaluate how an observer visually encodes tool–object affordances. Eye-movements were recorded as right-handed participants freely viewed static, right-handed, egocentric tool–object images across three contexts: correct (e.g. hammer-nail), incorrect (e.g. hammer-paper), spatial/ambiguous (e.g. hammer-wood), and three grasp-types: no hand, functional grasp-posture (grasp hammer-handle), non-functional/manipulative grasp-posture (grasp hammer-head). There were three areas of interests (AOI): the object (nail), the operant tool-end (hammer-head), the graspable tool-end (hammer-handle). Participants passively evaluated whether tool–object pairs were functionally correct/incorrect. Clustering of gaze scanpaths and AOI weightings grouped conditions into three distinct grasp-specific clusters, especially across correct and spatial tool–object contexts and to a lesser extent within the incorrect tool–object context. The grasp-specific gaze scanpath clusters were reasonably robust to the temporal order of gaze scanpaths. Gaze was therefore automatically primed to grasp-affordances though the task required evaluating tool–object context. Participants also primarily focused on the object and the operant tool-end and sparsely attended to the graspable tool-end, even in images with functional grasp-postures. In fact, in the absence of a grasp, the object was foveally weighted the most, indicative of a possible object-oriented action priming effect wherein the observer may be evaluating how the tool engages on the object. Unlike the functional grasp-posture, the manipulative grasp-posture caused the greatest disruption in the object-oriented priming effect, ostensibly as it does not afford tool–object action due to its non-functional interaction with the operant tool-end that actually engages with the object (e.g., hammer-head to nail). The enhanced attention towards the manipulative grasp-posture may serve to encode grasp-intent. Results here shed new light on how an observer gathers action-information when evaluating static tool–object scenes and reveal how contextual and grasp-specific affordances directly modulate visuospatial attention.

AB  - Abstract
The neural substrates of fatigue induced by muscular activity have been addressed in depth in relation to isometric tasks. For these activities, when fatigue develops, it has been noted that the duration of the silent periods (SPs) increases in response to both transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of primary motor cortex or electric cervicomedullary stimulation (CMS). However, fatigue is known to be task-dependent and the mechanisms giving rise to a decrease in motor performance during brief, fast repetitive tasks have been less studied. We hypothesized that fatigue induced by repetitive fast finger tapping may have physiological mechanisms different from those accounting for fatigue during an isometric contraction, even in cases of matched effort durations. In these tasks, we examined the contribution of spinal and supraspinal motor circuits to the production of fatigue. The tapping rate and maximal voluntary contractions (MVC), and TMS- and CMS-evoked SPs were obtained at the time of fatigue, and while subjects maintained maximal muscle activation after fast finger-tapping (or isometric activity) of different durations (10 or 30 s). Results showed different mechanisms of fatigue triggered by isometric contraction and repetitive movements, even of short duration. Short-lasting repetitive movements induce fatigue within intracortical inhibitory circuits. They increased TMS-SPs, but not CMS-SPs. On the other hand, isometric contraction had a clear impact on spinal circuits. The consideration of these differences might help to optimize the study of fatigue in physiological conditions and neurological disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Persistent neuroadaptations following chronic psychostimulant exposure include reduced striatal dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) levels. The signaling of D2Rs is initiated by Gαi/o proteins and terminated by regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins. The purpose of this study is to examine the association of the drug taking behavior and gene expression profile of D2/D3Rs, and their associated signaling proteins in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) using a rodent model of amphetamine (AMPH) self-administration. Rats were allowed to self-administer AMPH (0.187 mg/kg/infusion for a maximum of 40 injections in 6 h daily sessions) for 5 days during which rats showed an escalated rate of AMPH intake across days. AMPH self-administration induced profound brain region-dependent alterations of the targeted genes. There was a positive correlation of the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels of RGS10 between the VTA and the NAc in the control animals, which was abolished by AMPH self-administration. AMPH self-administration also produced a negative correlation of the mRNA levels of RGS7 and RGS19 between the two brain regions, which was not present in the control group. Furthermore, AMPH taking behavior was associated with changes in certain gene expression levels. The mRNA levels of RGS2 and RGS4 in both the VTA and NAc were positively correlated with the rate of AMPH intake. Additionally, the rate of AMPH intake was also positively correlated with RGS10 and negatively correlated with RGS17 and the short form of D2Rs mRNA level in the VTA. Although there were significant changes in the mRNA levels of RGS7 and RGS8 in the NAc, none of these measures were correlated with the rate of AMPH intake. The present study suggested that short-term AMPH self-administration produced pronounced changes in the VTA that were more associated with AMPH taking behavior than changes in the NAc.

AB  - Abstract
The hippocampus role in sensory-motor integration remains unclear. In these experiments we study its function in the locomotor control. To establish the connection between the hippocampus and the locomotor system, electrical stimulation in the CA1 region was applied and EMG recordings were obtained. We also evaluated the hindlimbs and forelimbs kinematic patterns in rats with a penetrating injury (PI) in the hippocampus as well as in a cortex-injured group (CI), which served as control. After the PI, tamoxifen a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that has been described as a neuroprotector and antiinflammatory drug, or vehicle was administered. Electrical stimulation in the hippocampus produces muscle contractions in the contralateral triceps, when 6 Hz or 8 Hz pulse trains were applied. The penetrating injury in the hippocampus reduced the EMG amplitude after the electrical stimulation. At 7DPI (days post-injury) we observed an increase in the strides speed in all four limbs of the non-treated group, decreasing the correlation percentage of the studied joints. After 15DPI the strides speed in the non-treated returned to normal. These changes did not occur in the tamoxifen group nor in cortex-injured group. After 30 days, the nontreated group presented a reduction in the number of pyramidal cell layer neurons at the injury site, in comparison to the tam-treated group. The loss of neurons, may cause the interruption of the trisynaptic circuit and changes in the locomotion speed. Tamoxifen preserves the pyramidal neurons after the injury, probably resulting in the strides speed recovery.

AB  - Abstract
This study tightly controlled seizure duration and severity during status epilepticus (SE) in postnatal day 10 (P10) rats, in order to isolate hyperthermia as the main variable and to study its consequences. Body temperature was maintained at 39 ± 1 °C in hyperthermic SE rats (HT + SE) or at 35 ± 1 °C in normothermic SE animals (NT + SE) during 30 min of SE, which was induced by lithium–pilocarpine (3 mEq/kg, 60 mg/kg) and terminated by diazepam and cooling to NT. All video/EEG measures of SE severity were similar between HT + SE and NT + SE pups. At 24 h, neuronal injury was present in the amygdala in the HT + SE group only, and was far more severe in the hippocampus in HT + SE than NT + SE pups. Separate groups of animals were monitored four months later for spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS). Only HT + SE animals developed convulsive SRS. Both HT + SE and NT + SE animals developed electrographic SRS (83% vs. 55%), but SRS frequency and severity were higher in hyperthermic animals (12.5 ± 3.5 vs. 4.2 ± 2.0 SRS/day). The density of hilar neurons was lower, thickness of the amygdala and perirhinal cortex was reduced, and lateral ventricles were enlarged in HT + SE over NT + SE littermates and HT/NT controls.

In this model, hyperthermia greatly increased the epileptogenicity of SE and its neuropathological sequelae.

AB  - Abstract
Taste aversion learning is a type of conditioning where animals learn to associate a novel taste (conditioned stimulus; CS) with a stimulus inducing symptoms of poisoning or illness (unconditioned stimulus; US). As a consequence animals later avoid this taste, a reaction known as conditioned taste aversion (CTA). An established CTA extinguishes over time when the CS is repeatedly presented in the absence of the US. However, inter-individual differences in CTA extinction do exist. Using a model of behavioral conditioning with saccharin as CS and the immunosuppressant cyclosporine A as US, the present study aimed at further elucidating the factors underlying individual differences in extinction learning by investigating whether extinction of an established CTA is related to the strength of the initially acquired CS–US association. In addition, we analyzed the expression of the neuronal activation marker c-fos in brain structures relevant for acquisition and retrieval of the CTA, such as the insular cortex and the amygdala. We here show that animals, displaying a strong CS–US association during acquisition, maintained a strong CTA during unreinforced CS re-exposures, in contrast to animals with moderate CS–US association. Moreover, the latter animals showed increased c-fos mRNA expression in the insular cortex. Our data indicate that CTA extinction apparently depends on the strength of the initially learned CS–US association. In addition, these findings provide further evidence that the memory for the initial excitatory conditioning and its subsequent extinction is probably stored in those structures that participate in the processing of the CS and the US.

AB  - Abstract
Introduction: Neuro-vascular rearrangement occurs in brain disorders, including epilepsy. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ) is used as a marker of perivascular pericytes. Whether PDGFRβ+ cell reorganization occurs in regions of neuro-vascular dysplasia associated with seizures is unknown. Methods: We used brain specimens derived from epileptic subjects affected by intractable seizures associated with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) or temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (TLE-HS). Tissues from cryptogenic epilepsy, non-sclerotic hippocampi or peritumoral were used for comparison. An in vivo rat model of neuro-vascular dysplasia was obtained by pre-natal exposure to methyl-axozy methanoic acid (MAM). Status epilepticus (SE) was induced in adult MAM rats by intraperitoneal pilocarpine. MAM tissues were also used to establish organotypic hippocampal cultures (OHC) to further assess pericytes positioning at the dysplastic microvasculature. PDGFRβ and its colocalization with RECA-1 or CD34 were used to segregate perivascular pericytes. PDGFRβ and NG2 or IBA1 colocalization were performed. Rat cortices and hippocampi were used for PDGFRβ western blot analysis. Results: Human FCD displayed the highest perivascular PDGFRβ immunoreactivity, indicating pericytes, and presence of ramified PDGFRβ+ cells in the parenchyma and proximal to microvessels. Tissues deriving from human cryptogenic epilepsy displayed a similar pattern of immunoreactivity, although to a lesser extent compared to FCD. In TLE-HS, CD34 vascular proliferation was paralleled by increased perivascular PDGFRβ+ pericytes, as compared to non-HS. Parenchymal PDGFRβ immunoreactivity co-localized with NG2 but was distinct from IBA1+ microglia. In MAM rats, we found pericyte-vascular changes in regions characterized by neuronal heterotopias. PDGFRβ immunoreactivity was differentially distributed in the heterotopic and adjacent normal CA1 region. The use of MAM OHC revealed microvascular-pericyte dysplasia at the capillary tree lining the dentate gyrus (DG) molecular layer as compared to control OHC. Severe SE induced PDGFRβ+ immunoreactivity mostly in the CA1 region of MAM rats. Conclusion: Our descriptive study points to microvascular-pericyte changes in the epileptic pathology. The possible link between PDGFRβ+ cells, neuro-vascular dysplasia and remodeling during seizures is discussed.

AB  - Abstract
Objective: Spatial orientation and navigation depends on information from the vestibular system. Previous work suggested impaired spatial navigation in patients with bilateral vestibular failure (BVF). The aim of this study was to investigate event-related brain activity by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during spatial navigation and visual memory tasks in BVF patients. Methods: Twenty-three BVF patients and healthy age- and gender matched control subjects performed learning sessions of spatial navigation by watching short films taking them through various streets from a driver’s perspective along a route to the Cathedral of Cologne using virtual reality videos (adopted and modified from Google Earth®). In the scanner, participants were asked to respond to questions testing for visual memory or spatial navigation while they viewed short video clips. From a similar but not identical perspective depicted video frames of routes were displayed which they had previously seen or which were completely novel to them. Results: Compared with controls, posterior cerebellar activity in BVF patients was higher during spatial navigation than during visual memory tasks, in the absence of performance differences. This cerebellar activity correlated with disease duration. Conclusions: Cerebellar activity during spatial navigation in BVF patients may reflect increased non-vestibular efforts to counteract the development of spatial navigation deficits in BVF. Conceivably, cerebellar activity indicates a change in navigational strategy of BVF patients, i.e. from a more allocentric, landmark or place-based strategy (hippocampus) to a more sequence-based strategy. This interpretation would be in accord with recent evidence for a cerebellar role in sequence-based navigation.

AB  - Abstract
Adult neurogenesis occurs in mammals within the dentate gyrus, a hippocampal subarea. It is known to be induced by antidepressant treatment and reduced in response to nicotine administration. We checked here whether the antidepressant fluoxetine would inverse the decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis caused by nicotine. It is shown that repeated, but not a single injection of rats with fluoxetine was able to abolish the decrease in adult dentate cell proliferation produced by nicotine treatment. We measured the expression of several biochemical parameters known to be associated with neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. Both drugs increased the expression of p75 neurotrophin receptor, which promotes proliferation and early maturation of dentate gyrus cells. Using the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm, we also gave both drugs in a context in which their rewarding properties could be measured. Fluoxetine produced a significant but less robust CPP than nicotine. A single injection of fluoxetine was found to reduce nicotine-induced CPP. Moreover, the rewarding properties of nicotine were completely abolished in response to repeated fluoxetine injections. Expression of nicotine-induced CPP was accompanied by an increase of phospho-CREB (cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein) and HDAC2 (histone deacetylase 2) expression in the nucleus accumbens. The data suggest that fluoxetine reward, as opposed to nicotine reward, depends on dentate gyrus neurogenesis. Since fluoxetine was able to disrupt the association between nicotine and the environment, this antidepressant may be tested as a treatment for nicotine addiction using cue exposure therapy.

AB  - Abstract
Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) acts on G protein-coupled receptors: the specific PAC1 and VPAC1/VPAC2 receptors. PACAP6-38 was described as a potent PAC1/VPAC2 antagonist in several models, but recent studies reported its agonistic behaviors proposing novel receptorial mechanisms. Since PACAP in migraine is an important research tool, we investigated the effect of PACAP and its peptide fragments on trigeminal primary sensory neurons.

Effect of the peptides was studied with ratiometric Ca-imaging technique using the fluorescent indicator fura-2 AM on primary cultures of rat and mouse trigeminal ganglia (TRGs) neurons. Specificity testing was performed on PAC1, VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptor-expressing cell lines with both fluorescent and radioactive Ca-uptake methods.

Slowly increasing intracellular free calcium concentration [Ca2+]i was detected after PACAP1-38, PACAP1-27, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and the selective PAC1 receptor agonist maxadilan administration on TRG neurons, but interestingly, PACAP6-38, VIP6-28 and the PAC1 receptor antagonist M65 also caused similar activation. The VPAC2 receptor agonist BAY 55-9837 induced similar activation, while the VPAC1 receptor agonist Ala11,22,28VIP had no significant effect on [Ca2+]i. It was proven that the Ca2+-influx originated from intracellular stores using radioactive calcium-45 uptake experiment and Ca-free solution. On the specific receptor-expressing cell lines the antagonists inhibited the stimulating actions of the respective agonists, but had no effects by themselves.

PACAP6-38, M65 and VIP6-28, which were described as antagonists in numerous studies in several model systems, act as agonists on TRG primary sensory neurons. Currently unknown receptors or splice variants linked to distinct signal transduction pathways might explain these differences.

AB  - Abstract
Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) are extensively expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), and have distinct spatial and temporal patterns in different cell types during development. Previous studies have demonstrated possible roles for RPTPs in axon outgrowth, guidance, and synaptogenesis. In the present study, our results revealed that protein tyrosine phosphatase, receptor type D (PTPRD) was initially expressed in mature neurons in embryonic CNS, and later in oligodendroglial cells at postnatal stages when oligodendrocytes undergo active axonal myelination process. In PTPRD mutants, oligodendrocyte differentiation was normal and a transient myelination delay occurred at early postnatal stages, indicating the contribution of PTPRD to the initiation of axonal myelination. Our results also showed that the remyelination process was not affected in the absence of PTPRD function after a cuprizone-induced demyelination in adult animals.

AB  - Abstract
The clinical differential diagnosis between the Parkinson variant of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) is difficult in early stages. To identify objective markers for differential diagnosis, we combined the novel tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and region of interest (ROI) analyses for the first time to investigate three groups (15 MSA-P, 20 PD patients and 20 controls) with diffusion tensor imaging data. By TBSS, we performed pairwise comparisons of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity maps. The clusters with significant differences between MSA-P and PD were used as ROIs for further analyses. FA/RD values in bilateral corticospinal tract (CST) and left anterior thalamic radiation (ATR) in MSA-P were significantly different from PD or controls, and significantly correlated with clinical data. These findings indicated that the abnormalities of left ATR and bilateral CST were specific for MSA-P relative to PD or controls, and seemed to be promising for differential diagnosis. Furthermore, it may be useful for severity assessment of MSA-P.

AB  - Abstract
Social play is a motivated and rewarding behavior that is displayed by nearly all mammals and peaks in the juvenile period. Moreover, social play is essential for the development of social skills and is impaired in social disorders like autism. We recently showed that the lateral septum (LS) is involved in the regulation of social play behavior in juvenile male and female rats. The LS is largely modulated by GABA and glutamate neurotransmission, but their role in social play behavior is unknown. Here, we determined whether social play behavior is associated with changes in the extracellular release of GABA and glutamate in the LS and to what extent such changes modulate social play behavior in male and female juvenile rats. Using intracerebral microdialysis in freely behaving rats, we found no sex difference in extracellular GABA concentrations, but extracellular glutamate concentrations are higher in males than in females under baseline conditions and during social play. This resulted in a higher glutamate/GABA concentration ratio in males vs. females and thus, an excitatory predominance in the LS of males. Furthermore, social play behavior in both sexes is associated with significant increases in extracellular release of GABA and glutamate in the LS. Pharmacological blockade of GABA-A receptors in the LS with bicuculline (100 ng/0.5 μl, 250 ng/0.5 μl) dose-dependently decreased the duration of social play behavior in both sexes. In contrast, pharmacological blockade of ionotropic glutamate receptors (NMDA and AMPA/kainate receptors) in the LS with AP-5 + CNQX (2 mM + 0.4 mM/0.5 μl, 30 mM + 3 mM/0.5 μl) dose-dependently decreased the duration of social play behavior in females, but did not alter social play behavior in males. Together, these data suggest a role for GABA neurotransmission in the LS in the regulation of juvenile social play behavior in both sexes, while glutamate neurotransmission in the LS is involved in the sex-specific regulation of juvenile social play behavior.

The neural basis of human speech is unclear. Intracranial electrophysiological recordings have revealed that high-gamma band oscillations (70–150 Hz) are observed in the frontal lobe during speech production and in the temporal lobe during speech perception. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the frontal and temporal brain regions had high-gamma coherence during speech. We recorded electrocorticography (ECoG) from the frontal and temporal cortices of five humans who underwent surgery for medically intractable epilepsy, and studied coherence between the frontal and temporal cortex during vocalization and playback of vocalization. We report two novel results. First, we observed high-gamma band as well as theta (4–8 Hz) coherence between frontal and temporal lobes. Second, both high-gamma and theta coherence were stronger when subjects were actively vocalizing as compared to playback of the same vocalizations. These findings provide evidence that coupling between sensory–motor networks measured by high-gamma coherence plays a key role in feedback-based monitoring and control of vocal output for human vocalization.

AB  - Abstract
The brain of children affected by organic acidemias develop acute neurodegeneration linked to accumulation of endogenous toxic metabolites like glutaric (GA), 3-hydroxyglutaric (3-OHGA), methylmalonic (MMA) and propionic (PA) acids. Excitotoxic and oxidative events are involved in the toxic patterns elicited by these organic acids, although their single actions cannot explain the extent of brain damage observed in organic acidemias. The characterization of co-adjuvant factors involved in the magnification of early toxic processes evoked by these metabolites is essential to infer their actions in the human brain. Alterations in the kynurenine pathway (KP) – a metabolic route devoted to degrade tryptophan to form NAD+ – produce increased levels of the excitotoxic metabolite quinolinic acid (QUIN), which has been involved in neurodegenerative disorders. Herein we investigated the effects of subtoxic concentrations of GA, 3-OHGA, MMA and PA, either alone or in combination with QUIN, on early toxic endpoints in rat brain synaptosomes. To establish specific mechanisms, we pre-incubated synaptosomes with different protective agents, including the endogenous N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist kynurenic acid (KA), the antioxidant S-allylcysteine (SAC) and the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME). While the incubation of synaptosomes with toxic metabolites at subtoxic concentrations produced no effects, their co-incubation (QUIN + GA, +3-OHGA, +MMA or +PA) decreased the mitochondrial function and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and lipid peroxidation. For all cases, this effect was partially prevented by KA and l-NAME, and completely avoided by SAC. These findings suggest that early damaging events elicited by organic acids involved in metabolic acidemias can be magnified by toxic synergism with QUIN, and this process is mostly mediated by oxidative stress, and in a lesser extent by excitotoxicity and nitrosative stress. Therefore, QUIN can be hypothesized to contribute to the pathophysiology of brain degeneration in children with metabolic acidemias.

AB  - Abstract
Ischemic injuries within the motor cortex result in functional deficits that may profoundly impact activities of daily living in patients. Current rehabilitation protocols achieve only limited recovery of motor abilities. The brain reorganizes spontaneously after injury, and it is believed that appropriately boosting these neuroplastic processes may restore function via recruitment of spared areas and pathways. Here I review studies on circuit reorganization, neuronal and glial plasticity and axonal sprouting following ischemic damage to the forelimb motor cortex, with a particular focus on rodent models. I discuss evidence pointing to compensatory take-over of lost functions by adjacent peri-lesional areas and the role of the contralesional hemisphere in recovery. One key issue is the need to distinguish “true” recovery (i.e. re-establishment of original movement patterns) from compensation in the assessment of post-stroke functional gains. I also consider the effects of physical rehabilitation, including robot-assisted therapy, and the potential mechanisms by which motor training induces recovery. Finally, I describe experimental approaches in which training is coupled with delivery of plasticizing drugs that render the remaining, undamaged pathways more sensitive to experience-dependent modifications. These combinatorial strategies hold promise for the definition of more effective rehabilitation paradigms that can be translated into clinical practice.

AB  - Abstract
The objective in this study was to test the hypothesis that the GABA-synthesizing enzyme, glutamic acid decarboxylase (Gad67), expressed in striatal neurons plays a key role in dyskinesia induced by l-DOPA (LID) in a rodent model of Parkinson’s disease. In light of evidence that the dopamine Drd1a receptor is densely expressed in striatal direct pathway striatal neurons while the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor Gpr88 is densely expressed in striatal direct and indirect pathway striatal neurons, we used a cre-lox strategy to produce two lines of mice that were Gad1 (Gad1 is the gene encoding for Gad67)-deficient in neurons expressing the Drd1a or the Gpr88 receptor. Gad67 loss in Gpr88-expressing neurons mice did not result in gross motor abnormalities while mice with Gad67 loss in Drd1a-expressing neurons were impaired on the Rotarod and the pole test. Knockout and control littermate mice were unilaterally injected into the medial forebrain bundle with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in order to lesion dopamine neurons on one side of the brain. 6-OHDA-lesioned mice were then injected once daily for 10 days with l-DOPA. Mice with a Gad67 loss in Gpr88-expressing neurons and control littermates developed abnormal involuntary movements (AIM), a measure of dyskinesia. In contrast, mice with a Gad67 loss in Drd1a-expressing did not develop AIM. The results demonstrate that Gad67 in Drd1a-expressing neurons plays a key role in the development of LID and they support the hypothesis that altered GABAergic neurotransmission in the direct pathway is involved in dyskinesia.

AB  - Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with a risk of neurodegenerative disease. Some suggest a link between TBI and motor neuron disease (MND), including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To investigate the potential mechanisms linking TBI to MND, we measured motor function and neuropathology following mild-TBI in wild-type and a transgenic model of ALS, G93A mutant mice. Mild-TBI did not alter the lifespan of G93A mice or age of onset; however, rotarod performance was impaired in G93A verses wild-type mice. Grip strength was reduced only in G93A mice after mild-TBI. Increased electromyography (EMG) abnormalities and markers of denervation (AchR, Runx1) indicate that mild-TBI may result in peripheral effects that are exaggerated in G93A mice. Markers of inflammation (cell edema, astrogliosis and microgliosis) were detected at 24 and 72 h in the brain and spinal cord in wild-type and G93A mice. Levels of F2-isoprostanes, a marker of oxidative stress, were increased in the spinal cord 24 h post mild-TBI in wild-type mice but were not affected by TBI in G93A mice. In summary, our data demonstrate that mild-TBI induces inflammation and oxidative stress and negatively impacts muscle denervation and motor performance, suggesting mild-TBI can potentiate motor neuron pathology and influence the development of MND in mice.

AB  - Abstract
Repeated forced swim (FS) conditioning enhances nociceptive responses to temporomandibular joint (TMJ) stimulation in female rats. The basis for FS-induced TMJ hyperalgesia remains unclear. To test the hypothesis that serotonin 3 receptor (5HT3R) mechanisms contribute to enhanced TMJ nociception after FS, ovariectomized female rats were treated with estradiol and subjected to FS for three days. On day 4, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and TMJ-responsive neurons were recorded from superficial and deep laminae at the trigeminal subnucleus caudalis/upper cervical (Vc/C1–2) region and electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded from the masseter muscle. Only Vc/C1–2 neurons activated by intra-TMJ injections of ATP were included for further analysis. Although neurons in both superficial and deep laminae were activated by ATP, only neurons in deep laminae displayed enhanced responses after FS. Local application of the 5HT3R antagonist, ondansetron (OND), at the Vc/C1–2 region reduced the ATP-evoked responses of neurons in superficial and deep laminae and reduced the EMG response in both sham and FS rats. OND also decreased the spontaneous firing rate of neurons in deep laminae and reduced the high-threshold convergent cutaneous receptive field area of neurons in superficial and deep laminae in both sham and FS rats. These results revealed that central application of a 5HT3R antagonist, had widespread effects on the properties of TMJ-responsive neurons at the Vc/C1–2 region and on jaw muscle reflexes under sham and FS conditions. It is concluded that 5HT3R does not play a unique role in mediating stress-induced hyperalgesia related to TMJ nociception.

AB  - Abstract
Objective: Effects of the long-term use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on the brains of patients with epilepsy have been previously reported. The aim of this study was to determine the rapid brain structure remodeling induced by single-dose intravenous AED administration that rules out the potential effects of epilepsy. Methods: Ten rhesus monkeys were randomly divided into two groups and were intravenously administered a single dose of valproic acid (VPA) or levetiracetam (LEV) at treatment dosages. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were recorded from every subject prior to AED administration and at 2 h and 1 week after administration. Using optimized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis, we measured changes in regional gray matter volume (GMV) and white matter volume (WMV) in each group over time following medication and directly compared the differences between the two groups. Results: Both AEDs induced brain volume alterations at 2 h after their administration, but these changes had reverted at 1 week. The VPA group exhibited increased GMV in the right geniculate nucleus and the right pulvinar, whereas the LEV group exhibited WMV reductions in the right pulvinar, the right parietal lobe and the right occipital lobe. Directly compared with the LEV group, the VPA group exhibited a temporally constant GMV increase in the bilateral temporal cortex and a WMV reduction in the left pedunculus cerebri. Conclusions: Single-dose intravenous administration of a level of VPA or LEV that mimics clinical use is associated with rapid and reversible VBM-detected GMV or WMV alterations in rhesus monkeys. This finding may provide new insights into the understanding of AED-induced brain structure remodeling and may contribute to our understanding of the brain-level mechanisms and targets of AED action.

AB  - Abstract
Purpose: Our previous study suggested that the coiled coil domain-containing 55 gene (CCDC55), also named as NSRP1 (nuclear speckle splicing regulatory protein 1 (NSRP1)), was encompassed in a haplotype block spanning over the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene in patients with schizophrenia (SCZ). However, the neurobiological function of CCDC55 gene remains unknown. This study aims to uncover the potential role of CCDC55 in SCZ-associated molecular pathways. Experimental design: Using molecular cloning, sequencing and immune blotting to identify basic properties, yeast two-hybrid screening and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay to test protein–protein interaction, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CSLM) to show intracellular interaction of proteins. Principal findings: (i) CCDC55 is expressed as a nuclear protein in human neuronal cells; (ii) Protein–protein interaction analyses showed CCDC55 physically interacted with Ran binding protein 9 (RanBP9) and disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1); (iii) CCDC55 and RanBP9 co-localized in the nucleus of human neuronal cells; (iv) CCDC55 also interacted with the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1), and with the brain cannabinoid receptor-interacting protein 1a (CNRIP1a); (v) CNR1 activation in differentiated human neuronal cells resulted in an altered RanBP9 localization. Conclusion: CCDC55 may be involved in a functional bridging between the CNR1 activation and the DISC1/RanBP9-associated pathways.

AB  - Abstract
Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolyl)propionic acid (AMPA) receptors receive increasing interest as therapeutic drugs and have long served as important experimental tools in the study of the molecular mechanisms underlying glutamate-mediated neurotransmission. The aim of this study was to investigate functional and structural aspects of a novel analog of the AMPA receptor PAM cyclothiazide (CTZ) on recombinant and native glutamate receptors. We expressed rat GluA4flip and flop in Xenopus oocytes and characterized NS1376 and CTZ under two-electrode voltage-clamp. The dose–response analyses revealed dual effects of NS1376. The modulator induced 30-fold and 42-fold reductions in glutamate potency and increased the glutamate efficacy by 3.2-fold and 5.3-fold at GluA4flip and GluA4flop, respectively. Rapid application of glutamate to excised outside-out patches showed that NS1376 markedly attenuated desensitization, supporting the increased efficacy observed in the oocytes. Furthermore, when applied to acutely isolated mouse brain slices, NS1376 reduced the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in the hippocampus to 51.6 ± 4.3% of baseline, likely as a consequence of reduced glutamate potency. However, the modulator displayed no effects on a sub-maximal long-term potentiation (LTP) protocol. We confirmed that CTZ increases presynaptic transmitter release, a property which was not shared by NS1376. Finally, we obtained detailed molecular information through X-ray structures, docking and molecular dynamics, which revealed that NS1376 interacts at the dimer interface of the ligand-binding domain in a manner overall similar to CTZ. NS1376 reveals that minor structural changes in CTZ can result in an altered modulatory profile, both enhancing agonist efficacy while markedly reducing agonist potency. These unique properties add new aspects to the complexity of allosteric modulations in neuronal systems.

AB  - Abstract
In this study, we analyzed the spatiotemporal alterations of phospholipid composition in the spinal cord of an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mouse model (G93A-mutated human superoxide dismutase 1 transgenic mice [SOD1G93A mice]) using imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), a powerful method to visualize spatial distributions of various types of molecules in situ. Using this technique, we deciphered the phospholipid distribution in the pre-symptomatic stage, early stage after disease onset, and terminal stages of disease in female SOD1G93A mouse spinal cords. These experiments revealed a significant decrease in levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-containing phosphatidylcholines (PCs), such as PC (diacyl-16:0/22:6), PC (diacyl-18:0/22:6), and PC (diacyl-18:1/22:6) in the L5 anterior horns of terminal stage (22-week-old) SOD1G93A mice. The reduction in PC (diacyl-16:0/22:6) level could be reflecting the loss of motor neurons themselves in the anterior horn of the spinal cord in ALS model mice. In contrast, other PCs, such as PC (diacyl-16:0/16:0), were observed specifically in the L5 dorsal horn gray matter, and their levels did not vary between ALS model mice and controls. Thus, our study showed a significant decrease in DHA-containing PCs, but not other PCs, in the terminal stage of ALS in model mice, which is likely to be a reflection of neuronal loss in the anterior horns of the spinal cords. Given its enrichment in dorsal sensory regions, the preservation of PC (diacyl-16:0/16:0) may be the result of spinal sensory neurons being unaffected in ALS. Taken together, these findings suggest that ALS spinal cords show significant alterations in PC metabolism only at the terminal stage of the disease, and that these changes are confined to specific anatomical regions and cell types.

Objective: The current study aimed to explore the effects of apolipoprotein e (ApoE) on intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) and apoptosis of neurons after mechanical injury in vitro. Methods: A neuron mechanical injury model was established after primary neurons obtained from APOE knockout and wild-type (WT) mice, and four experimental groups were generated: Group-ApoE4, Group-ApoE3, Group-ApoE(−) and Group-WT. Recombinant ApoE4 and ApoE3 were added to Group-ApoE4 and Group-ApoE3 respectively, and Group-ApoE(−) and Group-WT were control groups. Intracellular calcium was labeled by fluo-3/AM and examined using laser scanning confocal microscope and flow cytometry, and the apoptosis of neurons was also evaluated. Results: The intracellular calcium levels and apoptosis rates of mice neurons were significantly higher in Group-ApoE4 than in Group-ApoE3 and Group-WT after mechanical injury. However, without mechanical injury on neurons, no significant differences in intracellular calcium levels and apoptosis rates were found among all four experimental groups. The effects of ApoE4 on intracellular calcium levels and apoptosis rates of injured neurons were partly decreased by EGTA treatment. Conclusion: Compared with ApoE3-treatment and WT neurons, ApoE4 caused higher intracellular calcium levels and apoptosis rates of neurons after mechanical injury. This suggested APOE polymorphisms may affect neuron apoptosis after mechanical injury through different influences on intracellular calcium levels.

AB  - Abstract
Fragile X syndrome is a learning disability caused by excess of CGG repeats in the 5′ untranslated region of the Fragile X gene (FMR1) silencing its transcription and translation. We used a murine model of this condition, Fmr1 knock-out mice (KO) to study acetylcholine (ACh) metabolism and compared it to that of wild-type control mice (WT). Brain endogenous ACh (D0ACh), free choline (D0Ch), their deuterated variants D4ACh and D4Ch and mole ratios (AChMR and ChMR) were measured by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry in the cerebral hemisphere, cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum, following D4Ch administration. Regression analysis indicated a significant decrease with age (negative slope) of D4ACh, AChMR, D4Ch and ChMR in WT mice. Age dependence was only present for D4ACh and AChMR in KO mice. Analysis of variance with age as covariate indicated a significant greater D4Ch in the cerebral cortex of KO females when compared to WT females. Contrasts between sexes within genotypes indicated lower D0Ch in cortex and cerebellum of female KO mice but not in WT and lower D4Ch in hippocampus of female KO and WT mice.

In conclusion, after adjusting for age, D0ACh concentrations and synthesis from deuterium-labeled Ch were similar in KO and control WT mice in all brain regions. In contrast, significant changes in Ch dynamics were found in hippocampus and cerebral cortex of KO mice that might contribute to the pathogenesis of FXS.

AB  - Abstract
The concept of synergy provides a theoretical framework for movement stability resulting from the neural organization of multiple elements (digits, muscles, etc.) that all contribute to salient performance variables. Although stability of performance is obviously important for steady-state tasks leading to high synergy indices, a feed-forward drop in synergy indices is seen in preparation to a quick action (i.e., anticipatory synergy adjustments, ASAs). We review recent studies of multi-finger and multi-muscle synergies that show decreased indices of synergies and ASAs in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) or multisystem atrophy. In PD, the impairments in synergies and ASAs are partially reversed by dopaminergic drugs, and changes in synergy indices are present even in PD patients at earliest diagnosis. Taken together, these results point at subcortical structures that are crucial for proper control of movement stability. It is timely to introduce the concept of impaired control of stability as an objective, quantifiable, and theory-based clinical descriptor of movement disorders that can increase our understanding of the neural control of movement with all of its implications for clinical practice.

AB  - Abstract
Daily intermittent access to sugar solutions results in intense bouts of sugar intake (i.e. bingeing) in rats. Bingeing on sucrose, a disaccharide of glucose and fructose, has been associated with a “primed” mesolimbic dopamine (DA) pathway. Recent studies suggest glucose and fructose engage brain reward and energy-sensing mechanisms in opposing ways and may drive sucrose intake through unique neuronal circuits. Here, we examined in male Sprague–Dawley rats whether or not (1) intermittent access to isocaloric solutions of sucrose, glucose or fructose results in distinctive sugar-bingeing profiles and (2) previous sugar bingeing alters cocaine locomotor activation and/or reward, as determined by conditioned place preference (CPP). To encourage bingeing, rats were given 24-h access to water and 12-h-intermittent access to chow plus an intermittent bottle that contained water (control) or 8% solutions of sucrose, glucose or fructose for 9 days, followed by ad libitum chow diet and a 10-day cocaine (15 mg/kg; i.p.) CPP paradigm. By day 4 of the sugar-bingeing diet, sugar bingeing in the fructose group surpassed the glucose group, with the sucrose group being intermediate. All three sugar groups had similar chow and water intake throughout the diet. In contrast, controls exhibited chow bingeing by day 5 without altering water intake. Similar magnitudes of cocaine CPP were observed in rats with a history of sucrose, fructose or chow (control) bingeing. Notably, the glucose-bingeing rats did not demonstrate a significant cocaine CPP despite showing similar cocaine-induced locomotor activity as the other diet groups. Overall, these results show that fructose and glucose, the monosaccharide components of sucrose, produce divergent degrees of bingeing and cocaine reward.

AB  - Abstract
It is evident that eating in misalignment with the biological clock (such as in shift work, eating late at night and skipping breakfast) is associated with increased risk for obesity and diabetes. The biological clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus dictates energy balance including feeding behavior and glucose metabolism. Besides eating and sleeping patterns, glucose metabolism also exhibits clear diurnal variations with higher blood glucose concentrations, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity prior to waking up. The daily variation in plasma glucose concentrations in rats, is independent of the rhythm in feeding behavior. On the other hand, feeding itself has profound effects on glucose metabolism, but differential effects occur depending on the time of the day. We here review data showing that a disturbed diurnal eating pattern results in alterations in glucose metabolism induced by a disrupted circadian clock. We first describe the role of central serotonin on feeding behavior and glucose metabolism and subsequently describe the effects of central serotonin on the circadian system. We next explore the interaction between the serotonergic system and the circadian clock in conditions of disrupted diurnal rhythms in feeding and how this might be involved in the metabolic dysregulation that occurs with chronodisruption.

AB  - Abstract
The hippocampal neuronal network oscillation at γ frequency band (γ oscillation) is generated by the precise interaction between interneurons and principle cells. γ oscillation is associated with attention, learning and memory and is impaired in the diseased conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and schizophrenia. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) plays an important role in the regulation of hippocampal neurotransmission and network activity. It is not known whether nicotine modulates plasticity of network activity at γ oscillations in the hippocampus. In this study we investigated the effects of nicotine on the long-term changes of KA-induced γ oscillations. We found that hippocampal γ oscillations can be enhanced by a low concentration of nicotine (1 μM), such an enhancement lasts for hours after washing out of nicotine, suggesting a form of synaptic plasticity, named as long-term oscillation at γ frequency band (LTOγ). Nicotine-induced LTOγ was mimicked by the selective α4β2 but not by α7 nAChR agonist and was involved in N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation as well as depended on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Our results indicate that nAChR activation induced plasticity in γ oscillation, which may be beneficial for the improvement of cognitive deficiency in AD and schizophrenia.

AB  - Abstract
Brain ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury occurs in various pathological conditions, but there is no effective treatment currently available in clinical practice. Methylene blue (MB) is a century-old drug with a newly discovered protective function in the ischemic stroke model. In the current investigation we studied the MB-induced neuroprotective mechanism focusing on stabilization and activation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in an in vitro oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD)-reoxygenation model. Methods: HT22 cells were exposed to OGD (0.1% O2, 6 h) and reoxygenation (21% O2, 24 h). Cell viability was determined with the calcein AM assay. The dynamic change of intracellular O2 concentration was monitored by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLTIM). Glucose uptake was quantified using the 2-[N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-Oxa-1,3-Diazol-4-yl)Amino]-2-Deoxy-d-Glucose (2-NBDG) assay. ATP concentration and glycolytic enzyme activity were examined by spectrophotometry. Protein content changes were measured by immunoblot: HIF-1α, prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), erythropoietin (EPO), Akt, mTOR, and PIP5K. The contribution of HIF-1α activation in the MB-induced neuroprotective mechanism was confirmed by blocking HIF-1α activation with 2-methoxyestradiol-2 (2-MeOE2) and by transiently transfecting constitutively active HIF-1α. Results: MB increases cell viability by about 50% vs. OGD control. Compared to the corresponding control, MB increases intracellular O2 concentration and glucose uptake as well as the activities of hexokinase and G-6-PDH, and ATP concentration. MB activates the EPO signaling pathway with a corresponding increase in HIF-1α. Phosphorylation of Akt was significantly increased with MB treatment followed by activation of the mTOR pathway. Importantly, we observed, MB increased nuclear translocation of HIF-1α vs. control (about three folds), which was shown by a ratio of nuclear:cytoplasmic HIF-1α protein content. Conclusion: We conclude that MB protects the hippocampus-derived neuronal cells against OGD-reoxygenation injury by enhancing energy metabolism and increasing HIF-1α protein content accompanied by an activation of the EPO signaling pathway.

AB  - Abstract
Properties of excitatory synaptic responses in fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) and pyramidal neurons (PNs) are different; however, the mechanisms and determinants of this diversity have not been fully investigated. In the present study, voltage-clamp recording of miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs) was performed of layer 2–3 FSIs and PNs in the medial prefrontal cortex of rats aged 19–22 days. The average mEPSCs in the FSIs exhibited amplitudes that were two times larger than those of the PNs and with much faster rise and decay. The mEPSC amplitude distributions in both cell types were asymmetric and in FSIs, the distributions were more skewed and had two-times larger coefficients of variation than in the PNs. In PNs but not in FSIs, the amplitude distributions were fitted well by different skewed unimodal functions that have been used previously for this purpose. In the FSIs, the distributions were well approximated only by a sum of two such functions, suggesting the presence of at least two subpopulations of events with different modal amplitudes. According to our estimates, two-thirds of the mEPSCs in FSIs belong to the high-amplitude subpopulation, and the modal amplitude in this subpopulation is approximately two times larger than that in the low-amplitude subpopulation. Using different statistical models, varying binning size, and data subsets, we confirmed the robustness and consistency of these findings.

AB  - Abstract
Hippocampus displays functional heterogeneity along its long axis which has been interpreted in terms of segregation of inputs. Recent evidence has shown that there are also important differences in the organization of the local neuronal circuitry between the dorsal (DH) and the ventral hippocampus (VH). Synaptic plasticity is a crucial factor for the function of the hippocampal circuit. In this study I compared the synaptic facilitation of the CA1 excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) between dorsal and ventral rat hippocampal slices using field recordings and paired-pulse stimulation delivered at varying inter-pulse intervals (IPIs). The facilitation of the EPSP-slope displayed an exponential decline with increasing stimulation strength or IPI. Furthermore, the facilitation of threshold EPSP-slope was significantly higher in DH than in VH at all IPIs. Most remarkably, the facilitation of the area of EPSP displayed a prominent peak at around 200 ms in DH but not VH. This optimal facilitation declined abruptly at a position located two thirds of the way along the dorsoventral axis. N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors (NMDARs) contributed to the facilitation of EPSP-area in an IPI-selective manner in DH but not VH. Furthermore, NMDARs participated to the single-pulse-evoked EPSP-area more in VH than in DH. Blockade of GABAB receptors (GABABRs) eliminated the prominent facilitation at around 200 ms and abolished the large dorsoventral difference in the facilitation of EPSP-area. Blockade of GABAA receptors (GABAARs) increased the maximum area of EPSP more in VH than in DH and reversed facilitation into GABABR-dependent depression that was more robust in DH than in VH. I conclude that interactions between the synaptic actions of GABABR, GABAAR, and NMDAR contribute to diversifying short-term synaptic plasticity along the dorsoventral axis of the hippocampus. It is hypothesized that this diversification has important implications for the information processing performed by the local circuitries of the two hippocampal segments.

AB  - Abstract
Iron overload contributes to the development of neurodegeneration and the exacerbation of normal apoptosis rates, largely due to its participation in the Fenton reaction and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondria constitute the major intracellular source of ROS and the main target of attack by free radicals. They are dynamic organelles that bind (fusion) and divide (fission) in response to environmental stimuli, developmental status, and energy needs of the cells. Sulforaphane (SFN) is a natural compound that displays antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. This study aims to investigate the effects of SFN on memory deficits and changes in markers of mitochondrial function, DNM1L and OPA1, and the synaptic marker, synaptophysin, induced by neonatal iron treatment. Male rats received vehicle or carbonyl iron (30 mg/kg) from the 12th to the 14th postnatal day. In adulthood, they were treated with saline or SFN (0.5 or 5 mg/kg) for 14 days every other day. Memory deficits were assessed using the object recognition task. DNM1L, OPA1, and synaptophysin levels in the hippocampus were quantified by Western blotting. Results showed that SFN was able to reverse iron-induced decreases in mitochondrial fission protein, DNM1L, as well as synaptophysin levels in the hippocampus, leading to a recovery of recognition memory impairment induced by iron. These findings suggest that SFN may be further investigated as potential agent for the treatment of cognitive deficits associated with neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Probenecid has been used for decades to treat gout, and recent studies have revealed it is also a specific inhibitor of the pannexin-1 channel. It has been reported that the pannexin-1 channel is involved in ischemic injury. Here, we investigated the neuroprotective effect and the possible mechanisms of action of probenecid in global cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats. Twenty minutes of transient global cerebral I/R injury was induced using the four-vessel occlusion (4-VO) method in male Sprague–Dawley rats. Different doses of probenecid were administered intravenously, intraperitoneally, or by gavage before or after reperfusion. Probenecid via all three routes protected against CA1 neuronal death when given before reperfusion. This protective effect continued when probenecid was given at 2 h after reperfusion, but not at 6 h. Interestingly, the protective effect regained if probenecid was given continuously for 7 days after reperfusion. The release of cathepsin B and overexpression of calpain-1 after reperfusion were inhibited, while the upregulation of Hsp70 was strengthened by probenecid pre-treatment. Furthermore, the activation and proliferation of microglia and astrocytes after I/R injury were suppressed by continuous given for 7 days, but only partly by a single dose at 6 h of reperfusion. Thus, our data indicate that probenecid protects against transient global cerebral I/R injury probably by inhibiting calpain–cathepsin pathway and the inflammatory reaction.

AB  - Abstract
Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) is a feared complication of cerebral ischemic infarction, especially following the use of thrombolytic therapy. In this study, we examined whether docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3), an omega-3 essential fatty acid family member, can protect the brain from injury and whether DHA can decrease the risk of HT enhanced by hyperglycemia after focal ischemic injury. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were injected with 50% dextrose (6 ml/kg intraperitoneally) to induce hyperglycemia 10 min before 1.5 h of filament middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was performed. Treatment with DHA (10 mg/kg) 5 min before reperfusion reduced HT and further improved the 7-day neurological outcome. It also reduced infarct volume, which is consistent with the restricted DWI and T2WI hyperintensive area. Reduced Evans Blue extravasation and increased expression of collagen IV indicated the improved integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) in DHA-treated rats. Moreover, DHA reduced the expression of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in the ischemic injured brain. Therefore, we conclude that DHA attenuated hyperglycemia-enhanced HT and improved neurological function by preserving the integrity of BBB and reducing inflammation.

The human brain is composed of complex networks of 100 billion neurons that underlie its higher functions. The set of neural connections in the brain has recently attracted growing interest from the scientific community. It is important to identify individual differences in these neural connections to study the background of individual differences in brain function and performance. In the present study, we investigated whether the pattern of brain diffusion, reflecting neural connections, is discernibly different among individuals; i.e., whether brain diffusivity is personally identifiable information. Using diffusion tensor imaging data from 224 healthy subjects scanned twice at an interval of about 1 year, we performed brain recognition by spatial normalization of fractional anisotropy maps, feature extraction based on Principal Component Analysis, and calculation of the Euclidean distances between image pairs projected into the subspace. Even with only 16 dimensions used for projection, the rank-one identification rate was 99.1%. The rank-one identification rate was 100% with ⩾32 dimensions used for projection. The genuine accept rates were 95.1% and 100% at a false accept rate of 0.001%, with 16 and ⩾32 dimensions used for projection, respectively. There were no large differences in the Euclidean distance among different combinations of scanners used or between image pairs with and without scanner upgrade. The results indicate that brain diffusivity can identify a specific individual; i.e., the pattern of brain diffusion is personally identifiable information. Individual differences in brain diffusivity will form the basis of individual differences in personality and brain function.

AB  - Abstract
Although much prior work has focused on the known cortical pathology that defines Alzheimer’s disease (AD) histologically, recent work has additionally demonstrated substantial damage to the cerebral white matter in this condition. While there is large evidence of diffuse damage to the white matter in AD, it is unclear whether specific white matter tracts exhibit a more accelerated pattern of damage and whether the damage is associated with the classical neurodegenerative changes of AD. In this study, we investigated microstructural differences in the large fascicular bundles of the cerebral white matter of individuals with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), using recently developed automated diffusion tractography procedures in the Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Eighteen major fiber bundles in a total of 36 individuals with AD, 81 MCI and 60 control participants were examined with the TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy (TRACULA) procedure available as part of the FreeSurfer image processing software package. For each fiber bundle, the mean fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean, radial and axial diffusivities were calculated. Individuals with AD had increased diffusivities in both left and right cingulum-angular bundles compared to control participants (p &lt; 0.001). Individuals with MCI also had increased axial and mean diffusivities and increased FA in both cingulum-angular bundles compared to control participants (p &lt; 0.05) and decreased radial diffusivity compared to individuals with AD (p &lt; 0.05). We additionally examined how white matter deterioration relates to hippocampal volume, a traditional imaging measure of AD pathology, and found the strongest negative correlations in AD patients between hippocampal volume and the diffusivities of the cingulum-angular and cingulum-cingulate gyrus bundles and of the corticospinal tracts (p &lt; 0.05). However, statistically controlling for hippocampal volume did not remove all group differences in white matter measures, suggesting a unique contribution of white matter damage to AD unexplained by this disease biomarker. These results suggest that (1) AD-associated deterioration of white matter fibers is greatest in tracts known to be connected to areas of pathology in AD and (2) lower white matter tract integrity is more diffusely associated with lower hippocampal volume indicating that the pathology in the white matter follows to some degree the neurodegenerative staging and progression of this condition.

Converging data in songbirds support a central role for the medial preoptic nucleus (POM) in motivational aspects of vocal production. Recent data suggest that dopamine in the POM plays a complex modulatory role in the production of sexually-motivated song and that an optimal level of dopamine D1 receptor stimulation is required to facilitate singing behavior. To further explore this possibility, we used quantitative real-time PCR to examine relationships between mRNA expression of D1 as well as D2 receptors in the POM (and also the lateral septum and Area X) and sexually-motivated singing behavior in male European starlings. Results showed that both males with the highest and lowest D1 expression in the POM sang significantly less than males with intermediate levels of expression. Furthermore, singing behavior rose linearly in association with increasing levels of D1 expression in POM but dropped abruptly, such that individuals with D1 expression values higher than the mean sang very little. Analysis of birds with low and intermediate levels of D1 expression in POM revealed strong positive correlations between D1 expression and song but negative relationships between D2 receptor expression and song. These findings support prior work suggesting an optimal level of POM D1 receptor stimulation best facilitates sexually-motivated singing behavior. Results also suggest that D2 receptors may work in opposition to D1 receptors in POM to modify vocal production.

AB  - Abstract
Obesity may result from dysfunction of the reward system, especially in the nucleus accumbens (Acb). Based on this hypothesis, many researchers have tested the effect of high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the Acb shell (Acb-Sh) and/or core (Acb-Co) on ingestive behaviors, but few studies have explored the possible mechanisms involved in the differences between the Acb-Sh and Acb-Co. The present study tested effects of HFS of the Acb-Sh and Acb-Co on high-fat food (HFF) consumption in rats after 24 h of food deprivation. Microdialysis and electrophysiological experiments were carried out in awake rats to explore potential mechanisms. The results showed that the Acb-Sh decreased HFF consumption after food deprivation both during and post-HFS. However, HFS of the Acb-Co did not induce similar changes in food consumption. HFS of the Acb-Sh (Sh-HFS) induced an increase in GABA level in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) during both phases, whereas HFS of the Acb-Co (Co-HFS) did not exhibit similar effects. The electrophysiological experiment showed that nearly all the LHA neurons were inhibited by Sh-HFS, and the mean firing rate decreased significantly both during and post-HFS. In contrast, the mean firing rate of the LHA neurons did not exhibit clear changes during Co-HFS, although some individual neurons appeared to exhibit responses to Co-HFS. Considering all the data, we postulated that Sh-HFS, rather than Co-HFS, might inhibit palatable food consumption after food deprivation by decreasing the reward value of that food, which suggested that it might also disturb the process of developing obesity. The mechanisms involved in the different effects of Sh-HFS and Co-HFS on food consumption may be associated with different neural responses in the LHA. The Acb-Sh has abundant GABAergic projections to the LHA, whereas the Acb-Co has few or no GABAergic innervations to the LHA. Thus, neural activity in the LHA exhibits different responses to Sh-HFS and Co-HFS.

AB  - Abstract
The endocannabinoid system (ECS) has therapeutic potential for treating chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-induced cerebral diseases. This study investigated the protective effects of two ECS compounds, cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 (WIN) and fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor URB597 (URB) on CCH-induced neuronal apoptosis in vivo. CCH was induced in male Sprague–Dawley rats by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAo); the rats were then treated with WIN or URB for 12 weeks and their spatial learning and memory abilities were assessed using the Morris water maze. Changes in neuronal number were examined by labeling neurons with an antibody against the neuronal nuclei antigen, and apoptosis of cortical and hippocampal CA1 neurons was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling. The expression of B cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2, Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), and activated caspase-3 as well as mitogen-activated protein kinases including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, phosphorylated (p-)ERK, p-JNK, and p-P38 was examined by Western blotting. Rats treated with WIN or URB showed better learning and memory performance than controls. The neuroprotective effects of URB were greater than those of WIN, and co-administration of WIN and URB had a synergistic effect. In addition, WIN and URB blocked JNK phosphorylation as well as the decrease in Bcl-2/Bax ratio and caspase-3 activation induced by CCH, implying that these agents modulate neuronal survival. Moreover, the selective JNK inhibitor SP600125 improved mitochondrial membrane dysfunction and blocked neuronal apoptosis induced by JNK-dependent Bcl-2 signaling. WIN and URB enhanced the effects of SP600125, implying that they may exert anti-apoptotic effects in part by inhibiting a non-nuclear JNK pathway. These findings indicate that WIN and URB promote neuronal survival and may potentially be used to protect neurons against chronic ischemic insults.

AB  - Abstract
A number of studies have shown that mutations or deletions of the monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) gene cause elevated CNS serotonin and elevated impulsive aggression in humans and animal models. In addition, low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5HIAA) has been documented in a limited number of violent criminal populations and in macaques that exhibit impulsive aggression. To reconcile these different analyses, we hypothesized that CSF 5HIAA reflected degradation of serotonin by the activity of MAO-A; and that low MAO-A activity would result in lower CSF 5HIAA, but overall higher serotonin in the CNS. To test this hypothesis, male Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) were castrated, rested for 5–7 months, and then treated for 3 months with [1] placebo, [2] testosterone (T), [3] dihydrotestosterone (DHT; non-aromatizable androgen) and 1,4,6-androstatriene-3,17-dione (ATD) (steroidal aromatase inhibitor), or [4] flutamide (FLUT; androgen antagonist) and ATD (n = 5/group). These treatments enable isolation of androgen and estrogen activities. In the dorsal raphe, MAO-A and MAO-B expressions were determined with in situ hybridization (ISH) and protein expression of aromatase was determined with immunohistochemistry (IHC). CSF concentrations of 5HIAA, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), and homovanillic acid (HVA) were determined with liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). From the same animals, previously published data on serotonin axon density were used as a proxy for CNS serotonin. Aromatase conversion of T to estrogen (E) suppressed MAO-A (positive pixel area, p = 0.0045), but androgens increased MAO-B (positive pixel area, p = 0.014). CSF 5HIAA was suppressed by conversion of T to E (Cohen’s d = 0.6). CSF 5HIAA was positively correlated with MAO-A-positive pixel area (r2 = 0.78). CSF 5HIAA was inversely correlated with serotonin axon-positive pixel area (r2 = 0.69). In summary, CSF 5HIAA reflects MAO-A activity rather than global serotonin. Low CSF 5HIAA may, in this paradigm, reflect higher serotonin activity. Androgens lower MAO-A activity via metabolism to E, thus elevating CNS serotonin and decreasing CSF 5HIAA. Since androgens increase certain types of aggression, these data are consistent with studies demonstrating that lower MAO-A activity is associated with elevated serotonin and increased aggression.

AB  - Abstract
The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is necessary for the proper function of the brain. Its maintenance is regulated by endogenous factors. Recent evidences suggest prolactin (PRL) regulates the BBB properties in vitro, nevertheless no evidence of these effects have been reported in vivo. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of PRL in the maintenance of the BBB in the rat. Male Wistar rats were treated with Bromocriptine (Bromo) to inhibit PRL production for 28 days in the absence or presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). BBB permeability was evaluated through the Evans Blue dye and fluorescein-dextran extravasation as well as through edema formation. The expression of claudin-5, occludin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and the PRL receptor (PRLR) was evaluated through western blot. Bromo reduced the physiological levels of PRL at 28 days. At the same time, Bromo increased BBB permeability and edema formation associated with a decrement in claudin-5 and occludin and potentiated the increase in BBB permeability induced by LPS. However, no neuroinflammation was detected, since the expression of GFAP was unchanged, as well as the expression of the PRLR. These data provide the first evidence that inhibition of PRL with Bromo affects the maintenance of the BBB through modulating the expression of tight junction proteins in vivo.

AB  - Abstract
Adolescence is a critical period of brain maturation characterized by the reorganization of interacting neural networks. In particular the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a region involved in executive function, undergoes synaptic and neuronal pruning during this time in both humans and rats. Our laboratory has previously shown that rats lose neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and there is an increase in white matter under the frontal cortex between adolescence and adulthood. Female rats lose more neurons during this period, and ovarian hormones may play a role as ovariectomy before adolescence prevents neuronal loss. However, little is known regarding the timing of neuroanatomical changes that occur between early adolescence and adulthood. In the present study, we quantified the number of neurons and glia in the male and female mPFC at multiple time points from preadolescence through adulthood (postnatal days 25, 35, 45, 60 and 90). Females, but not males, lost a significant number of neurons in the mPFC between days 35 and 45, coinciding with the onset of puberty. Counts of GABA immunoreactive cell bodies indicated that the neurons lost were not primarily GABAergic. These results suggest that in females, pubertal hormones may exert temporally specific changes in PFC anatomy. As expected, both males and females gained white matter under the PFC throughout adolescence, though these gains in females were diminished after day 35, but not in males. The differences in cell loss in males and females may lead to differential vulnerability to external influences and dysfunctions of the PFC that manifest in adolescence.

AB  - Abstract
Schizophrenia patients treated with olanzapine, or other second-generation antipsychotics, frequently develop metabolic side-effects, such as glucose intolerance and increased adiposity. We previously observed that modeling these adverse effects in rodents also resulted in hippocampal shrinkage. Here, we investigated the impact of olanzapine treatment, and the beneficial influence of routine exercise, on the neurosecretion machinery of the hippocampus. Immunodensities and interactions of three soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins (syntaxin-1, synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) and vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)), synaptotagmin and complexins-1/2 were quantified in the hippocampus of sedentary and exercising rats exposed over 9 weeks to vehicle (n = 28) or olanzapine (10 mg/kg/day, n = 28). In addition, brain sections from subgroups of sedentary animals (n = 8) were co-immunolabeled with antibodies against vesicular GABA (VGAT) and glutamate (VGLUT1) transporters, along with syntaxin-1, and examined by confocal microscopy to detect selective olanzapine effects within inhibitory or excitatory terminals. Following olanzapine treatment, sedentary, but not exercising rats showed downregulated (33–50%) hippocampal densities of SNARE proteins and synaptotagmin, without altering complexin levels. Strikingly, these effects had no consequences on the amount of SNARE protein–protein interactions. Lower immunodensity of presynaptic proteins was associated with reduced CA1 volume and glucose intolerance. Syntaxin-1 depletion appeared more prominent in VGAT-positive terminals within the dentate gyrus, and in non-VGAT/VGLUT1-overlapping areas of CA3. The present findings suggest that chronic exposure to olanzapine may alter hippocampal connectivity, especially in inhibitory terminals within the dentate gyrus, and along the mossy fibers of CA3. Together with previous studies, we propose that exercise-based therapies might be beneficial for patients being treated with olanzapine.

AB  - Abstract
The arrival and refinement of corticospinal afferents are likely to influence the maturation of the spinal cord and sensory-motor networks. To understand this better, we studied the revision of monosynaptic muscle afferents, the expression of activity-related genes, neurotrophins and their receptors in the cervical spinal cord from postnatal day (P) 0 to 21. We compared control and Celsr3|Emx1 mice, in which corticospinal axons never develop. The corticospinal tract (CST), labeled by anti-protein kinase C gamma (PKCγ) antibody in the dorsal funiculus, increased gradually in the control, but was never visible in the mutant. Using anti-parvalbumin and choline acetyltransferase double immunostaining, close contacts between proprioceptive afferent fibers and spinal motor neurons appeared at P0 and were gradually eliminated thereafter, with no difference between control and mutant mice. In both genotypes, the number of parvalbumin-positive interneurons increased similarly from P7 to P21, and a comparable upregulation of c-Jun protein was seen at P7. Contrary to control samples, in which ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) protein levels increased from P0 to P7 and gradually decreased after P14, CNTF concentrations were time-invariant in mutant samples. The dynamic profile of neurotrophin-3 (NT3) expression was also moderately affected in mutant mice. In control spinal cord, NT3 was increased at P7 and decreased at P14, but remained more stable in mutant samples. In contrast, expression profiles of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) B, TrkC, p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) and glial cell-line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) were similar in both genotypes. In conclusion, with the possible exception of CNTF and NT3 expression, most events that accompany maturation of the spinal cord appear largely independent of corticospinal inputs.

AB  - Abstract
GABA receptor type A (GABAAR)-mediated inhibition is divided into phasic and tonic inhibition. GABAARs mediating the two inhibitory modalities exhibit differences in subcellular localization and subunit composition. We previously demonstrated that phasic and tonic inhibition are independently regulated by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and protein kinase A (PKA), respectively. Since modulation of GABAARs by phosphorylation differs depending on subunit composition and protein kinases, phasic and tonic inhibition might be differentially regulated by a single neuromodulator activating multiple protein kinases. However, the neuromodulatory control for phasic and tonic inhibition is largely unknown. Thus, in the present study, we concurrently investigated the serotonin (5-HT) regulation of phasic and tonic inhibition and its functional implication in the pyramidal neurons of the rat visual cortex. Interestingly, 5-HT enhanced phasic inhibition but suppressed tonic inhibition. Increase in phasic inhibition was mediated by 5-HT2 receptor and CaMKII, whereas decrease in tonic inhibition depended on 5-HT1A receptor and PKA. Thus, phasic and tonic inhibition might be independently regulated even by a single neuromodulator. Functionally, the opposite modulation of phasic and tonic inhibition decreased the summation of consecutive excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) without affecting the shape of single EPSPs, which might underlie the suppression of the induction of long-term potentiation by 5-HT. These results suggest that the integrative regulation of phasic and tonic inhibition provides mechanisms for elaborate modulation of shape and summation of EPSPs and long-term synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Abstract
Brain ischemia/reperfusion injury results in death of vulnerable neurons and extensive brain damage. It is well known that mitochondrial release of cytochrome c (cyto c) is a hallmark of neuronal death, however the molecular events underlying this release are largely unknown. We tested the hypothesis that cyto c release is regulated by breakdown of the cristae architecture maintenance protein, optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. We simulated ischemia/reperfusion in isolated primary rat neurons and interrogated OPA1 release from the mitochondria, OPA1 oligomeric breakdown, and concomitant dysfunction of mitochondrial dynamic state. We found that ischemia/reperfusion induces cyto c release and cell death that corresponds to multiple changes in OPA1, including: (i) translocation of the mitochondrial fusion protein OPA1 from the mitochondria to the cytosol, (ii) increase in the short isoform of OPA1, suggestive of proteolytic processing, (iii) breakdown of OPA1 oligomers in the mitochondria, and (iv) increased mitochondrial fission. Thus, we present novel evidence of a connection between release of cyto c from mitochondria and disruption of the mitochondrial fusion.

AB  - Abstract
The retina is a metabolically highly active tissue that is sensitive to pH changes. Blinding diseases of the retina are often characterized by degeneration of photoreceptor cells altering the acid-base homeostasis of the tissue microenvironment and by an accompanying inflammatory response. GPR4, GPR65 and GPR68 are G protein-coupled receptors that aid cells to sense and survive conditions of acidic pH and inflammatory cells express Gpr65 enhancing their viability. Hence, we investigated expression and function of these proton-sensing GPRs in the normal and degenerating retina. We observed increased retinal expression of Gpr65, but not of Gpr4 and Gpr68, in mouse models of both inherited (rd10) and induced (light damage) retinal degeneration. Lack of GPR65 slightly accelerated photoreceptor degeneration in rd10 mice and resulted in a strong activation of microglia after light-injury. Since GPR65 was dispensable for normal retinal development, function and aging as evidenced by the evaluation of Gpr65−/− mice, our results indicate that the proton-sensing G protein-coupled receptor GPR65 may be involved in a mechanism that supports survival of photoreceptors in the degenerating retina.

AB  - Abstract
Y-box-binding protein (YB-1) is a member of the cold-shock protein family and participates in a wide variety of DNA/RNA-dependent cellular processes including DNA repair, transcription, mRNA splicing, packaging, and translation. At the cellular level, YB-1 is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation, stress responses, and malignant cell transformation. A general role for YB-1 during inflammation has also been well described; however, there are minimal data concerning YB-1 expression in microglia, which are the immune cells of the brain. Therefore, we studied the expression of YB-1 in a clinically relevant global ischemia model for neurological injury following cardiac arrest. This model is characterized by massive neurodegeneration of the hippocampal CA1 region and the subsequent long-lasting activation of microglia. In addition, we studied YB-1 expression in BV-2 cells, which are an accepted microglia culture model. BV-2 cells were stressed by oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD), OGD-relevant mediators, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and phagocytosis-inducing cell debris and nanoparticles. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we show constitutive expression of YB-1 transcripts in unstressed BV-2 cells. The functional upregulation of the YB-1 protein was demonstrated in microglia in vivo and in BV-2 cells in vitro. All stressors except for LPS were potent enhancers of the level of YB-1 protein, which appears to be regulated primarily by proteasomal degradation and, to a lesser extent, by the activation (phosphorylation) of the translation initiation factor eIF4E. The proteasome of BV-2 cells is impaired by OGD, which results in decreased protein degradation and therefore increased levels of YB-1 protein. LPS induces proteasome activity, which enables the level of YB-1 protein to remain at control levels despite enhanced protein ubiquitination. The proteasome inhibitor MG-132 was able to increase YB-1 protein levels in control and LPS-treated cultures. YB-1 upregulation was not accompanied by its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. YB-1 induction appeared to be related to microglial proliferation because it was partially co-regulated with Ki67. In addition, YB-1 protein levels correlated with microglia phagocytic activity because its upregulation could also be induced by inert NPs.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic stress during critical periods of human fetal brain development is associated with cognitive, behavioral, and mood disorders in later life. Altered glutamate receptor (GluR) expression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of stress-dependent disorders. To test whether prenatal chronic mild stress (PCMS) enhances offspring’s vulnerability to stress-induced behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities and if this enhanced vulnerability is sex-dependent, we measured depression-like behavior in the forced swimming test (FST) and regional changes in GluR subunit expression in PCMS-exposed adult male and female rats. Both male and female PCMS-exposed rats exhibited stronger depression-like behavior than controls. Males and females exhibited unique regional changes in GluR expression in response to PCMS alone, FST alone (CON-FST), and PCMS with FST (PCMS-FST). In females, PCMS alone did not alter N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) or metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) expression, while in PCMS males, higher mGluR2/3, mGluR5, and NR1 expression levels were observed in the prefrontal cortex. In addition, PCMS altered the change in GluR expression induced by acute stress (the FST test), and this too was sex-specific. Male PCMS-FST rats expressed significantly lower mGluR5 levels in the hippocampus, lower mGluR5, NR1, postsynaptic density protein (PSD)95, and higher mGluR2/3 in the prefrontal cortex, and higher mGluR5 and PSD95 in the amygdala than male CON-FST rats. Female PCMS-FST rats expressed lower NR1 in the hippocampus, lower NR2B and PSD95 in the prefrontal cortex, lower mGluR2/3 in the amygdala, and higher PSD95 in the amygdala than female CON-FST rats. PCMS may increase the offspring’s vulnerability to depression by altering sex-specific stress-induced changes in glutamatergic signaling.

AB  - Abstract
An increase in the release of excitatory amino acids has consistently been observed in the hippocampus during seizures, both in humans and animals. However, very little or nothing is known about the extracellular levels of glutamate and aspartate during epileptogenesis and in the interictal chronic period of established epilepsy. The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the relationship between seizure activity and changes in hippocampal glutamate and aspartate extracellular levels under basal and high K+-evoked conditions, at various time-points in the natural history of experimental temporal lobe epilepsy, using in vivo microdialysis. Hippocampal extracellular glutamate and aspartate levels were evaluated: 24 h after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE); during the latency period preceding spontaneous seizures; immediately after the first spontaneous seizure; in the chronic (epileptic) period. We found that (i) basal (spontaneous) glutamate outflow is increased in the interictal phases of the chronic period, whereas basal aspartate outflow remains stable for the entire course of the disease; (ii) high K+ perfusion increased glutamate and aspartate outflow in both control and pilocarpine-treated animals, and the overflow of glutamate was clearly increased in the chronic group. Our data suggest that the glutamatergic signaling is preserved and even potentiated in the hippocampus of epileptic rats, and thus may favor the occurrence of spontaneous recurrent seizures. Together with an impairment of GABA signaling (Soukupova et al., 2014), these data suggest that a shift toward excitation occurs in the excitation/inhibition balance in the chronic epileptic state.

AB  - Abstract
Glutamate and nitric oxide (NO) are important regulators of dendrite and axon development in the central nervous system. Excess glutamatergic stimulation is a feature of many pathological conditions and manifests in neuronal atrophy and shrinkage with eventual neurodegeneration and cell death. Here we demonstrate that treatment of cultured primary cortical rat neurons for 24 h with glutamate (500 μM) or N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) (100–500 μM) combined with glycine suppresses neurite outgrowth. A similar reduction of neurite outgrowth was observed with the NO precursor l-arginine and NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) (100 and 300 μM). The NMDA-receptor (NMDA-R) antagonists ketamine and MK-801 (10 nM) counteracted the NMDA/glycine-induced reduction in neurite outgrowth and the neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) inhibitor 1-[2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl] imidazole (TRIM) (100 nM) counteracted both the NMDA/glycine and l-arginine-induced decreases in neurite outgrowth. Furthermore, targeting soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), a downstream target of NO, with the sGC inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) (10 μM) also protected against l-arginine-induced decreases in neurite outgrowth. Since the NMDA-R is functionally coupled to nNOS via the postsynaptic protein 95 kDa (PSD-95), inhibitors of the PSD-95/nNOS interaction were tested for their ability to protect against glutamate-induced suppression in neurite outgrowth. Treatment with the small-molecule inhibitors of the PSD-95/nNOS interface 2-((1H-benzo[d] [1,2,3]triazol-5-ylamino) methyl)-4,6-dichlorophenol (IC87201) (10 and 100 nM) and 4-(3,5-dichloro-2-hydroxy-benzylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid (ZL-006) (10 and 100 nM) attenuated NMDA/glycine-induced decreases in neurite outgrowth. These data support the hypothesis that targeting the NMDA-R/PSD-95/nNOS interaction downstream of NMDA-R promotes neurotrophic effects by preventing neurite shrinkage in response to excess glutamatergic stimulation. The PSD-95/nNOS interface may be an attractive target for treating deficits in neuronal outgrowth and atrophy associated with excessive glutamatergic neurotransmission in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions.

AB  - Abstract
The effects of mitochondrial inhibitors (CN−, a complex IV inhibitor and CCCP, protonophore) on catecholamine (CA) secretion and mitochondrial function were explored functionally and biochemically in rat and guinea-pig adrenal chromaffin cells. Guinea-pig chromaffin cells conspicuously secreted CA in response to CN− or CCCP, but rat cells showed a little, if any, secretory response to either of them. The resting metabolic rates in rat adrenal medullae did not differ from those in guinea-pig adrenal medullae. On the other hand, the time course of depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in guinea-pig chromaffin cells in response to CN− was slower than that in rat chromaffin cells, and this difference was abolished by oligomycin, an F1F0-ATPase inhibitor. The extent of CCCP-induced decrease in cellular ATP in guinea-pig chromaffin cells, which was indirectly measured using a Mg2+ indicator, was smaller than that in rat chromaffin cells. Relative expression levels of F1F0-ATPase inhibitor factor in guinea-pig adrenal medullae were smaller than in rat adrenal medullae, and the opposite was true for F1F0-ATPase α subunit. The present results indicate that guinea-pig chromaffin cells secrete more CA in response to a mitochondrial inhibitor than rat chromaffin cells and this higher susceptibility in the former is accounted for by a larger extent of reversed operation of F1F0-ATPase with the consequent decrease in ATP under conditions where ΔΨm is depolarized.

AB  - Abstract
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an idiopathic and lethal neurodegenerative disease that currently has no effective treatment. A recent study found that the Notch signaling pathway was up-regulated in a TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) Drosophila model of ALS. Notch signaling acts as a master regulator in the central nervous system. However, the mechanisms by which Notch participates in the pathogenesis of ALS have not been completely elucidated. Recent studies have shown that the mood stabilizers lithium and valproic acid (VPA) are able to regulate Notch signaling. Our study sought to confirm the relationship between the Notch pathway and ALS and whether the Notch pathway contributes to the neuroprotective effects of lithium and VPA in ALS. We found that the Notch pathway was activated in in vitro and in vivo models of ALS, and suppression of Notch activation with a Notch signaling inhibitor, N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-L-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) and Notch1 siRNA significantly reduced neuronal apoptotic signaling, as evidenced by the up-regulation of Bcl-2 as well as the down-regulation of Bax and cytochrome c. We also found that lithium and VPA suppressed the Notch activation associated with the superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) mutation, and the combination of lithium and VPA produced a more robust effect than either agent alone. Our findings indicate that the Notch pathway plays a critical role in ALS, and the neuroprotective effects of lithium and VPA against mutant SOD1-mediated neuronal damage are at least partially dependent on their suppression of Notch activation.

AB  - Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by severe cognitive impairment that ultimately leads to death. Endothelin (ET) and its receptors have been considered as therapeutic targets for AD. Recent studies in our lab have shown that stimulation of ETB receptors provide significant neuroprotection following Aβ1–40 administration. It is possible that IRL-1620 may be neuroprotective due to angiogenesis. However, the effect of IRL-1620 on neurovascular remodeling following Aβ1–40 administration has not been established. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of stimulation of ETB receptors by IRL-1620 on vascular and neuronal growth factors after Aβ1–40 administration. Rats were treated with Aβ1–40 (day 1, 7 and 14) in the lateral cerebral ventricles using stereotaxically implanted cannula and received three intravenous injections of IRL-1620 (an ETB agonist), and/or BQ788 (an ETB antagonist) at 2-h interval on day 8; experiments were performed on day 15. Rats were sacrificed for estimation of brain ETB receptors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) expression using immunofluorescence and Western blot. In the Morris swim task, amyloid-β (Aβ)-treated rats showed a significant (p &lt; 0.0001) impairment in spatial memory. Rats treated with IRL-1620 significantly (p &lt; 0.001) reduced the cognitive impairment induced by Aβ. BQ788 treatment completely blocked IRL-1620-induced improvement in cognitive impairment. IRL-1620 treatment enhanced the number of blood vessels labeled with VEGF compared to vehicle treatment. Additionally, cells showed increased (p &lt; 0.001) positive staining for NGF in IRL-1620-treated animals. ETB, VEGF and NGF protein expression significantly (p &lt; 0.001) increased in the brain of IRL-1620-treated rats as compared to vehicle. Pretreatment with BQ788 blocked the effects of IRL-1620, thus confirming the role of ETB receptors in the neurovascular remodeling actions of IRL-1620. Results of the present study demonstrate that IRL-1620 improves both acquisition (learning) and retention (memory) on the water maze task and enhances angiogenic and neurogenic remodeling. These findings indicate that the ETB receptor may be a novel therapeutic target for AD and other neurovascular degenerative disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Among vertebrates hippocampus forms the major component of the brain in consolidating information from short-term memory to long-term memory. Aging is considered as the major risk factor for memory impairment in sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (SAD) like pathology. Present study thus aims at investigating whether age-specific degeneration of neuronal-circuits in hippocampal formation (neural-layout of Subiculum-hippocampus proper-dentate gyrus (DG)-entorhinal cortex (EC)) results in cognitive impairment. Furthermore, the neuroprotective effect of Resveratrol (RSV) was attempted to study in the formation of hippocampal neuronal-circuits. Radial-Arm-Maze was conducted to evaluate hippocampal-dependent spatial and learning memory in control and experimental rats. Nissl staining of frontal cortex (FC), subiculum, hippocampal-proper (CA1→CA2→CA3→CA4), DG, amygdala, cerebellum, thalamus, hypothalamus, layers of temporal and parietal lobe of the neocortex were examined for pathological changes in young and aged wistar rats, with and without RSV. Hippocampal trisynaptic circuit (EC layerII→DG→CA3→CA1) forming new memory and monosynaptic circuit (EC→CA1) that strengthen old memories were found disturbed in aged rats. Loss of Granular neuron observed in DG and polymorphic cells of CA4 can lead to decreased mossy fibers disturbing neural-transmission (CA4→CA3) in perforant pathway. Further, intensity of nissl granules (stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM)-SR-SO) of CA3 pyramidal neurons was decreased, disturbing the communication in schaffer collaterals (CA3-CA1) during aging. We also noticed disarranged neuronal cell layer in Subiculum (presubiculum (PrS)-parasubiculum (PaS)), interfering output from hippocampus to prefrontal cortex (PFC), EC, hypothalamus, and amygdala that may result in interruption of thought processes. We conclude from our observations that poor memory performance of aged rats as evidenced through radial arm maze (RAM) analysis was due to the defect in neuronal-circuits of hippocampus (DG-CA4-CA1-Sub) that were significantly damaged leading to memory impairment. Interestingly, RSV was observed to culminate pathological events in the hippocampal neuronal circuit during aging, proving them as potent therapeutic drug against age-associated neurodegeneration and memory loss.

AB  - Abstract
While spinal cord astrocytes play a key role in the generation of cancer pain, there have been no studies that have examined the relationship of tumor-induced astrocyte activation and aromatase expression during the development of cancer pain. Here, we examined tumor-induced mechanical hyperalgesia and cold allodynia, and changes in Glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) and aromatase expression in murine models of painful and non-painful bone cancer. We demonstrate that implantation of fibrosarcoma cells, but not melanoma cells, produces robust mechanical hyperalgesia and cold allodynia in tumor-bearing mice compared to saline-injected controls. Secondly, this increase in mechanical hyperalgesia and cold allodynia is mirrored by significant increases in both spinal astrocyte activity and aromatase expression in the dorsal horn of fibrosarcoma-bearing mice. Importantly, we show that aromatase is only found within a subset of astrocytes and not in neurons in the lumbar spinal cord. Finally, administration of an aromatase inhibitor reduced tumor-induced hyperalgesia in fibrosarcoma-bearing animals. We conclude that a painful fibrosarcoma tumor induces a significant increase in spinal astrocyte activation and aromatase expression and that the up-regulation of aromatase plays a role in the development of bone tumor-induced hyperalgesia. Since spinal aromatase is also upregulated, but to a lesser extent, in non-painful melanoma bone tumors, it may also be neuroprotective and responsive to the changing tumor environment.

AB  - Abstract
A hallmark of chronic inflammation is hypersensitivity to noxious and innocuous stimuli. This inflammatory pain hypersensitivity results partly from hyperexcitability of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons innervating inflamed tissue, although the underlying ionic mechanisms are not fully understood. However, we have previously shown that the nociceptor hyperexcitability is associated with increased expression of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 2 (HCN2) protein and hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih) in C-nociceptors. Here we used in vivo voltage-clamp and current-clamp recordings, in deeply anesthetized rats, to determine whether activation properties of Ih in these C-nociceptors also change following persistent (not acute) hindlimb inflammation induced by complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA). Recordings were made from lumbar (L4/L5) C-nociceptive DRG neurons. Behavioral sensory testing was performed 5–7 days after CFA treatment, and all the CFA-treated group showed significant behavioral signs of mechanical and heat hypersensitivity, but not spontaneous pain. Compared with control, C-nociceptors recorded 5–7 days after CFA showed: (a) a significant increase in the incidence of spontaneous activity (from ∼5% to 26%) albeit at low rate (0.14 ± 0.08 Hz (Mean ± SEM); range, 0.01–0.29 Hz), (b) a significant increase in the percentage of neurons expressing Ih (from 35%, n = 43–84%, n = 50) based on the presence of voltage “sag” of &gt;10%, and (c) a significant increase in the conductance (Gh) of the somatic channels conducting Ih along with the corresponding Ih, Ih, activation rate, but not voltage dependence, in C-nociceptors. Given that activation of Ih depolarizes the neuronal membrane toward the threshold of action potential generation, these changes in Ih kinetics in CFA C-nociceptors may contribute to their hyperexcitability and thus to pain hypersensitivity associated with persistent inflammation.

AB  - Abstract
Children from pregnant smokers are more susceptible to become obese adults and to become drug or food addicts. Drugs and food activate the mesolimbic reward pathway, causing a sense of pleasure that induces further consumption. Here, we studied the relationship between tobacco smoke exposure during lactation with feeding, behavior and brain dopaminergic reward system parameters at adulthood. Nursing Wistar rats and their pups were divided into two groups: tobacco smoke-exposed (S: 4 times/day, from the 3rd to the 21th day of lactation), and ambient air-exposed (C). On PN175, both offspring groups were subdivided for a food challenge: S and C that received standard chow (SC) or that chose between high-fat (HFD) and high-sucrose diets (HSDs). Food intake was recorded after 30 min and 12 h. Offspring were tested in the elevated plus maze and open field on PN178–179; they were euthanized for dopaminergic analysis on PN180. SSD (self-selected diet) animals presented a higher food intake compared to SC ones. S-SSD animals ate more than C-SSD ones at 30 min and 12 h. Both groups preferred the HFD. However, S-SSD animals consumed relatively more HFD than C-SSD at 30 min. No behavioral differences were observed between groups. S animals presented lower tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) content in the ventral tegmental area, lower TH, dopaminergic receptor 2, higher dopaminergic receptor 1 contents in the nucleus accumbens and lower OBRb in hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. Tobacco-smoke exposure during lactation increases preference for fat in the adult progeny possibly due to alterations in the dopaminergic system.

AB  - Abstract
Addiction is a chronic relapsing disorder characterized by the loss of control over drug intake, high motivation to obtain the drug, and a persistent craving for the drug. Accumulating evidence implicates cellular and molecular alterations within cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic circuitry in the development and persistence of this disease. The striatum is a heterogeneous structure that sits at the interface of this circuit, receiving input from a variety of brain regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex, ventral tegmental area) to guide behavioral output, including motor planning, decision-making, motivation and reward. However, the vast interconnectivity of this circuit has made it difficult to isolate how individual projections and cellular subtypes within this circuit modulate each of the facets of addiction. Here, we review the use of new technologies, including optogenetics and DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs), in unraveling the role of the striatum in addiction. In particular, we focus on the role of striatal cell populations (i.e., direct and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons) and striatal dopaminergic and glutamatergic afferents in addiction-related plasticity and behaviors.

AB  - Abstract
In the central nervous system (CNS), insulin resistance (I/R) can cause defective neurite outgrowth and neuronal cell death, which can eventually lead to cognitive deficits. Recent research has focused on the relationship between I/R and the cognitive impairment caused by dementia, with the goal of developing treatments for dementia. Insulin signal transduction mediated by insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1) has been thoroughly studied in the CNS of patients with I/R. In the present study, we investigated whether the impairment of IRS-1-mediated insulin signaling contributes to neurite outgrowth and neuronal loss, both in mice fed a high-fat diet and in mouse neuroblastoma (Neuro2A) cells. To investigate the changes caused by the inhibition of IRS-1-mediated insulin signaling in the brain, we performed Cresyl Violet staining and immunochemical analysis. To investigate the changes caused by the inhibition of IRS-1-mediated insulin signaling in neuroblastoma cells, we performed Western blot analysis, reverse transcription-PCR, and immunochemical analysis. We show that the deactivation of IRS-1-mediated insulin signaling can inhibit neuronal outgrowth and aggravate neuronal cell death in the insulin-resistant CNS. Thus, IRS-1-mediated insulin signal transduction may be an important factor in the treatment of cognitive decline induced by I/R.

AB  - Abstract
Treatment of apnea of prematurity with methylxanthines like caffeine, aminophylline or theophylline can evoke hippocampal seizures. However, it is unknown at which interstitial brain concentrations methylxanthines promote such neonatal seizures or interfere with physiological ‘early network oscillations’ (ENOs) that are considered as pivotal for maturation of hippocampal neural networks. We studied theophylline and caffeine effects on ENOs in CA3 neurons (CA3-ENOs) and CA3 electrical stimulation-evoked monosynaptic CA1 field potentials (CA1-FPs) in sliced and intact hippocampi, respectively, from 8 to 10-days-old rats. Submillimolar doses of theophylline and caffeine, blocking adenosine receptors and phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4), did not affect CA3-ENOs, ENO-associated cytosolic Ca2+ transients or CA1-FPs nor did they provoke seizure-like discharges. Low millimolar doses of theophylline (⩾1 mM) or caffeine (⩾5 mM), blocking GABAA and glycine receptors plus sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA)-type Ca2+ ATPases, evoked seizure-like discharges with no indication of cytosolic Ca2+ dysregulation. Inhibiting PDE4 with rolipram or glycine receptors with strychnine had no effect on CA3-ENOs and did not occlude seizure-like events as tested with theophylline. GABAA receptor blockade induced seizure-like discharges and occluded theophylline-evoked seizure-like discharges in the slices, but not in the intact hippocampi. In summary, submillimolar methylxanthine concentrations do not acutely affect spontaneous CA3-ENOs or electrically evoked synaptic activities and low millimolar doses are needed to evoke seizure-like discharges in isolated developing hippocampal neural networks. We conclude that mechanisms of methylxanthine-related seizure-like discharges do not involve SERCA inhibition-related neuronal Ca2+ dysregulation, PDE4 blockade or adenosine and glycine receptor inhibition, whereas GABAA receptor blockade may contribute partially.

AB  - Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a movement disorder whose cardinal motor symptoms arise due to the progressive loss of dopamine. Although this dopamine loss typically progresses slowly over time, currently there are very few animal models that enable incremental dopamine depletion over time within the same animal. This type of gradual dopamine depletion model would be useful in studies aimed at the prodromal phase of PD, when dopamine levels are pathologically low but motor symptoms have not yet presented. Utilizing the highly characterized neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), we have developed a paradigm to gradually deplete dopamine levels in the striatum over a user-defined time course – spanning weeks to months – in C57BL/6 mice. Dopamine depletions were achieved by administration of five low-dose injections (0.75 μg) of 6-OHDA through an implanted intracranial bilateral cannula targeting the medial forebrain bundle. Levels of dopamine within the striatum declined linearly with successive injections, quantified using tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining and high-performance liquid chromatography. Behavioral testing was carried out at each time point to study the onset and progression of motor impairments as a function of dopamine loss over time. We found that spontaneous locomotion, measured in an open field, was robust until ∼70% of striatal dopamine was lost. Beyond this point, additional dopamine loss caused a sharp decline in motor performance, reaching a final level comparable to that of acutely depleted mice. Similarly, although rearing behavior was more sensitive to dopamine loss and declined linearly as a function of dopamine levels, it eventually declined to levels similar to those seen in acutely depleted mice. In contrast, motor coordination, measured on a vertical pole task, was only moderately impaired in gradually depleted mice, despite severe impairments observed in acutely depleted mice. These results demonstrate the importance of the temporal profile of dopamine loss on the magnitude and progression of behavioral impairments. Our gradual depletion model thus establishes a new paradigm with which to study how circuits respond and adapt to dopamine loss over time, information which could uncover important cellular events during the prodromal phase of PD that ultimately impact the presentation or treatability of behavioral symptoms.

AB  - Abstract
The prominent morphometric alterations of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) occur both in gray matter and in white matter. Multimodal fusion can examine joint information by combining multiple neuroimaging datasets to identify the covariant morphometric alterations in AD in greater detail. In the current study, we conducted a multimodal canonical correlation analysis and joint independent component analysis to identify the covariance patterns of the gray and white matter by fusing structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging data of 39 AD patients (23 males and 16 females, mean age: 74.91 ± 8.13 years) and 41 normal controls (NCs) (20 males and 21 females, mean age: 73.97 ± 6.34 years) derived from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. The results revealed 25 joint independent components (ICs), of which three joint ICs exhibited strong links between the gray matter volume and the white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) and significant differences between the AD and NC group. The joint IC maps revealed that the simultaneous changes in the gray matter and FA values primarily involved the following areas: (1) the temporal lobe/hippocampus-cingulum, (2) the frontal/cingulate gyrus-corpus callosum, and (3) the temporal/occipital/parietal lobe-corpus callosum/corona radiata. Our findings suggest that gray matter atrophy is associated with reduced white matter fiber integrity in AD and possibly expand the understanding of the neuropathological mechanisms in AD.

AB  - Abstract
Neurodegenerative diseases are difficult to study due to unavailability of human neurons. Cell culture systems and primary rodent cultures have shown to be indispensable to clarify disease mechanisms and provide insights into gene functions. Nevertheless, it is hard to translate new findings into new medicines. The discovery of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) might partially overcome this problem. Commercially available human iPSC-derived neurons, when thoroughly characterized and suitable for viral transduction, might represent a faster model for drugs screening than the time-consuming derivation and differentiation of iPSC from patient samples. In this study we show that iCell® neurons are primarily immature GABAergic neurons within the tested time frame. Addition of C6 glioma conditioned medium improved the bursting frequency of cells without further maturation or evidence for glutamatergic responses. Furthermore, cells were suitable for lentiviral transduction within the tested time frame. Altogether, iCell® neurons might be useful to model neurodegenerative diseases in which young GABAergic subtypes are affected.

AB  - Abstract
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease leading to progressive and lethal paralysis. The disease process is multi-factorial and is characterized by selective motor neuron degeneration. Previous work demonstrated that the local concentration of various growth factors can influence motor neuron survival and disease progression. A potential role for c-kit, a growth factor receptor present in the spinal cord, in ALS is unknown. To dissect the role of c-kit in ALS we interbred SOD1G93A mice with kitw-sh/w-sh mice, which have a 70% decrease in c-kit expression in the spinal cord. kitw-sh/w-sh SOD1G93A mice have a reduced survival compared to SOD1G93A mice, while the amount of motor neurons at end stage is similar. By means of grip strength and nerve conductance analysis we show that kitw-sh/w-sh mice have diminished strength and slightly impaired compound muscle action potential latency, although the number of neurons is similar across genotypes. Decreasing kit gene expression in SOD1G93A mice is detrimental and our results imply that this effect is independent of mast cells, as tested by ketotifen administration. To conclude, our data expand on the protective role of growth factors in ALS, as decreasing c-kit by approximately 70% is detrimental in SOD1G93A mice.

AB  - Abstract
While prolonged sleep deprivation (SD) could lead to profound negative health consequences, such as impairments in vital biological functions of immunity and cognition, melatonin possesses powerful ameliorating effects against those harmful insults. Melatonin has strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that help to restore body’s immune and cognitive functions. In this study, we investigated the possible role of melatonin in reversing cognitive dysfunction induced by SD in rats. Our experimental results revealed that sleep-deprived animals exhibited spatial memory impairment in the Morris water maze tasks compared with the control groups. Furthermore, there was an increased glial activation most prominent in the hippocampal region of the SD group compared to the normal control (NC) group. Additionally, markers of oxidative stress such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-deoxyguanine (8-oxo-dG) were significantly increased, while fragile X-mental retardation protein (FMRP) expression was decreased in the SD group. Interestingly, melatonin treatment normalized these events to control levels following SD. Our data demonstrate that SD induces oxidative stress through glial activation and decreases FMRP expression in the neurons. Furthermore, our results suggest the efficacy of melatonin for the treatment of sleep-related neuronal dysfunction, which occurs in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and autism.

AB  - Abstract
Prenatal ethanol exposure (PEE) promotes alcohol intake during adolescence, as shown in clinical and pre-clinical animal models. The mechanisms underlying this effect of prenatal ethanol exposure on postnatal ethanol intake remain, however, mostly unknown. Few studies assessed the effects of moderate doses of prenatal ethanol on spontaneous and ethanol-induced brain activity on adolescence. This study measured, in adolescent (female) Wistar rats prenatally exposed to ethanol (0.0 or 2.0 g/kg/day, gestational days 17–20) or non-manipulated (NM group) throughout pregnancy, baseline and ethanol-induced cathecolaminergic activity (i.e., colocalization of c-Fos and tyrosine hydroxylase) in ventral tegmental area (VTA), and baseline and ethanol-induced Fos immunoreactivity (ir) in nucleus accumbens shell and core (AcbSh and AcbC, respectively) and prelimbic (PrL) and infralimbic (IL) prefrontal cortex. The rats were challenged with ethanol (dose: 0.0, 1.25, 2.5 or 3.25 g/kg, i.p.) at postnatal day 37. Rats exposed to vehicle prenatally (VE group) exhibited reduced baseline dopaminergic tone in VTA; an effect that was inhibited by prenatal ethanol exposure (PEE group). Dopaminergic activity in VTA after the postnatal ethanol challenge was greater in PEE than in VE or NM animals. Ethanol-induced Fos-ir at AcbSh was found after 1.25 g/kg and 2.5 g/kg ethanol, in VE and PEE rats, respectively. PEE did not alter ethanol-induced Fos-ir at IL but reduced ethanol-induced Fos-ir at PrL. These results suggest that prenatal ethanol exposure heightens dopaminergic activity in the VTA and alters the response of the mesocorticolimbic pathway to postnatal ethanol exposure. These effects may underlie the enhanced vulnerability to develop alcohol-use disorders of adolescents with a history of in utero ethanol exposure.

AB  - Abstract
Exposure to stressors causes substantial effects on the perception and response to pain. In several animal models, chronic stress produces hyperalgesia. The insular (IC) and anterior cingulate cortices (ACC) are the regions exhibiting most reliable pain-related activity. And the IC and ACC play an important role in pain modulation via descending pain modulatory system. In the present study we examined the expression of phospho-cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) and ΔFosB and the acetylation of histone H3 in the IC and ACC after forced swim stress (FS) and complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) injection to clarify changes in the cerebral cortices that affect the activity of the descending pain modulatory system in rats with stress-induced hyperalgesia. CFA injection into the hindpaw or FS (day 1, 10 min; days 2–3, 20 min) induced a significant increase in the expression of pCREB and ΔFosB and the acetylation of histone H3 in the IC. Quantitative image analysis showed that the numbers of ΔFosB-immunoreactivity (IR) cells in the bilateral anterior and posterior IC (AIC and PIC) were significantly higher in the CFA group (AIC R, 548.0 ± 98.6; AIC L, 433.5 ± 89.4; PIC R, 546.1 ± 72.8; PIC L, 415.5 ± 53.5) than those in the naive group (AIC R, 86.6 ± 14.8; AIC L, 85.5 ± 24.7; PIC R, 124.5 ± 29.9; PIC L, 107.0 ± 19.8, p &lt; 0.01). However the FS prior to the CFA injection enhanced the mechanical hyperalgesia and attenuated the expression of pCREB and ΔFosB and the acetylation of histone H3 in the IC. There was no significant difference in the numbers of ΔFosB-IR cells in the bilateral PIC between the FS + CFA and naive groups. These findings suggest neuroplasticity in the IC after the FS, which may be involved in the enhancement of CFA-induced mechanical hyperalgesia through dysfunction of the descending pain modulatory system.

We here investigate the effects of two exercise modalities (endurance treadmill training-TM and voluntary free-wheel activity-FW) on the brain cortex and cerebellum mitochondrial bioenergetics, permeability transition pore (mPTP), oxidative stress, as well as on proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, apoptosis, and quality control. Eighteen male rats were assigned to sedentary-SED, TM and FW groups. Behavioral alterations and ex vivo brain mitochondrial function endpoints were assessed. Proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS, including the adenine nucleotide translocator), oxidative stress markers and regulatory proteins (SIRT3, p66shc, UCP2, carbonyls, MDA, -SH, aconitase, Mn-SOD), as well as proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC1α, TFAM) were evaluated. Apoptotic signaling was measured through quantifying caspase 3, 8 and 9-like activities, Bax, Bcl2, CypD, and cofilin expression. Mitochondrial dynamics (Mfn1/2, OPA1 and DRP1) and auto(mito)phagy (LC3II, Beclin1, Pink1, Parkin, p62)-related proteins were also measured by Western blotting. Only the TM exercise group showed increased spontaneous alternation and exploratory activity. Both exercise regimens improved mitochondrial respiratory activity, increased OXPHOS complexes I, III and V subunits in both brain subareas and decreased oxidative stress markers. Increased resistance to mPTP and decreased apoptotic signaling were observed in the brain cortex from TM and in the cerebellum from TM and FW groups. Also, exercise increased the expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, autophagy and fusion, simultaneous with decreased expression of mitochondrial fission-related protein DRP1. In conclusion, physical exercise improves brain cortex and cerebellum mitochondrial function, decreasing oxidative stress and apoptotic related markers. It is also possible that favorable alterations in mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics and autophagy signaling induced by exercise contributed to increased mitochondrial plasticity leading to a more robust phenotype.

AB  - Abstract
Opioid-induced rewarding and motorstimulant effects are mediated by an increased activity of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons. The excitatory mechanism of opioids on VTA-DA neurons has been proposed to be due to the depression of GABAergic synaptic transmission in VTA-DA neurons. However, how opioids depress GABAergic synaptic transmission in VTA-DA neurons remain to be studied. In the present study, we explored the mechanism of the inhibitory effect of [D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) on GABAergic synaptic transmission in VTA-DA neurons using multiple approaches and techniques. Our results showed that (1) DAMGO inhibits GABAergic inputs in VTA-DA neurons at presynaptic sites; (2) effect of DAMGO on GABAergic inputs in VTA-DA neurons is inhibited by potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and Gi protein inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide (NEM); (3) phospholipase A2 (PLA2) does not mediate the effect of DAMGO on GABAergic inputs in VTA-DA neurons, but mediates it in the periaqueductal gray (PAG); (4) multiple downstream signaling molecules of μ receptors do not mediate the effect of DAMGO on GABAergic inputs in VTA-DA neurons. These results suggest that DAMGO depresses inhibitory synaptic transmission via μ receptor-Gi protein-Kv channel pathway in VTA-DA neurons, but via μ receptor-PLA2 pathway in PAG neurons.

AB  - Abstract
Impulsive actions and decisions often lead to undesirable outcomes. Lesion and neuroimaging studies have revealed that the orbital frontal cortex (OFC) and dorsal striatum (dSTR) play key roles in inhibitory control. It has been proposed that greater OFC input into the dSTR reflects enhanced top-down cognitive control and less impulsive responding. We previously reported a sex difference in inhibitory control, such that female rats make fewer impulsive errors than do male rats. The goal of the present study was to investigate differences in the OFC and dSTR of young adult male and female rats. In Experiment 1, we measured levels of two myelin-associated proteins, myelin basic protein (MBP) and myelin proteolipid protein (PLP), in the OFC and dSTR. Western blot data revealed that females had significantly higher levels of both MBP and PLP in the OFC but similar levels in the dSTR as compared to males. In Experiment 2, we infused the anterograde tracer, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA), into the OFC and measured the density of BDA in the dSTR. BDA was visualized using histochemistry followed by light microscopy imaging and densitometry analysis. Density of BDA in the dSTR was significantly greater in females as compared to males indicating that the projections from the OFC to dSTR may be greater in females as compared to males. Our results suggest a potential neuroanatomical sex difference that may contribute to the reported differences in inhibitory control levels of male and female rats.

AB  - Abstract
Exposure to loud, prolonged sounds (acoustic trauma, AT) leads to the death of both inner and outer hair cells (IHCs and OHCs), death of neurons of the spiral ganglion and degeneration of the auditory nerve. The auditory nerve (8cn) projects to the three subdivisions of the cochlear nuclei (CN), the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DC) and the anterior (VCA) and posterior (VCP) subdivisions of the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN). There is both anatomical and physiological evidence for plastic reorganization in the denervated CN after AT. Anatomical findings show axonal sprouting and synaptogenesis; physiologically there is an increase in spontaneous activity suggesting reorganization of circuitry. The mechanisms underlying this plasticity are not understood. Recent data suggest that activated microglia may have a role in facilitating plastic reorganization in addition to removing trauma-induced debris. In order to investigate the roles of activated microglia in the CN subsequent to AT we exposed animals to bilateral noise sufficient to cause massive hair cell death. We studied four groups of animals at different survival times: 30 days, 60 days, 6 months and 9 months. We used silver staining to examine the time course and pattern of auditory nerve degeneration, and immunohistochemistry to label activated microglia in the denervated CN. We found both degenerating auditory nerve fibers and activated microglia in the CN at 30 and 60 days and 6 months after AT. There was close geographic overlap between the degenerating fibers and activated microglia, consistent with a scavenger role for activated microglia. At the longest survival time, there were still silver-stained fibers but very little staining of activated microglia in overlapping regions. There were, however, activated microglia in the surrounding brainstem and cerebellar white matter.

AB  - Abstract
Neuropeptide B and W (NPB and NPW) are cognate peptide ligands for NPBWR1 (GPR7), a G protein-coupled receptor. In rodents, they have been implicated in the regulation of energy homeostasis, neuroendocrine/autonomic responses, and social interactions. Although localization of these peptides and their receptors in adult rodent brain has been well documented, their expression in mouse brain during development is unknown. Here we demonstrate the transient expression of NPW mRNA in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) of postnatal mouse brain and its co-localization with neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA. Neurons expressing both NPW and NPY mRNAs begin to emerge in the DMH at about postnatal day 0 (P-0) through P-3. Their expression is highest around P-14, declines after P-21, and by P-28 only a faint expression of NPW and NPY mRNA remains. In P-18 brains, we detected NPW neurons in the region spanning the subincertal nucleus (SubI), the lateral hypothalamic (LH) perifornical (PF) areas, and the DMH, where the highest expression of NPW mRNA was observed. The majority of these postnatal hypothalamic NPW neurons co-express NPY mRNA. A cross of NPW-iCre knock-in mice with a Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter line revealed that more than half of the reporter-positive neurons in the adult DMH, which mature from the transiently NPW-expressing neurons, are sensitive to peripherally administrated leptin. These data suggest that the DMH neurons that transiently co-express NPW and NPY in the peri-weaning period might play a role in regulating energy homeostasis during postnatal development.

AB  - Abstract
Stimuli paired with rewards acquire reinforcing properties to promote reward-seeking behavior. Previous work supports the role of ventral tegmental area (VTA) nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in mediating conditioned reinforcement elicited by drug-associated cues. However, it is not known whether these cholinergic mechanisms are specific to drug-associated cues or whether VTA cholinergic mechanisms also underlie the ability of cues paired with natural rewards to act as conditioned reinforcers. Burst firing of VTA dopamine (DA) neurons and the subsequent phasic DA release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays an important role in cue-mediated behavior and in the ability of cues to acquire reinforcing properties. In the VTA, both AChRs and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) regulate DA burst firing and phasic DA release. Here, we tested the role of VTA nAChRs, muscarinic AChRs (mAChRs), and NMDARs in the conditioned reinforcement elicited by a food-associated, natural reward cue. Subjects received 10 consecutive days of Pavlovian conditioning training where lever extension served as a predictive cue for food availability. On day 11, rats received bilateral VTA infusion of saline, AP-5 (0.1 or 1 μg), mecamylamine (MEC: 3 or 30 μg) or scopolamine (SCOP: 3 or 66.7 μg) immediately prior to the conditioned reinforcement test. During the test, nosepoking into the active (conditioned reinforced, CR) noseport produced a lever cue while nosepoking on the inactive (non-conditioned reinforced, NCR) noseport had no consequence. AP-5 robustly attenuated conditioned reinforcement and blocked discrimination between CR and NCR noseports at the 1-μg dose. MEC infusion decreased responding for both CR and NCR while 66.7-μg SCOP disrupted the subject’s ability to discriminate between CR and NCR. Together, our data suggest that VTA NMDARs and mAChRs, but not nAChRs, play a role in the ability of natural reward-associated cues to act as conditioned reinforcers.

AB  - Abstract
GABA (γ-amino-butyric acid) -mediated signaling is normally associated with synaptic inhibition due to ionotropic GABA receptors that gate an inward Cl− current, hyperpolarizing the membrane potential. However, there are also situations where ionotropic GABA receptors trigger a Cl− efflux that results in depolarization. The well-characterized central nervous system of the medicinal leech was used to study the functional significance of opposing effects of GABA at the synaptic circuit level. Specifically, we focused on synapses made by the nociceptive N cell and the non-nociceptive P (pressure) cell that converge onto a common postsynaptic target. It is already known that GABA hyperpolarizes the P cell, but depolarizes the N cell and that inhibition of ionotropic GABA receptors by bicuculline (BIC) has opposing effects on the synapses made by these two inputs; enhancing P cell synaptic transmission, but depressing N cell synapses. The goal of the present study was to determine whether the opposing effects of GABA were due to differences in Cl− homeostasis between the two presynaptic neurons. VU 0240551 (VU), an inhibitor of the Cl− exporter K-Cl co-transporter isoform 2 (KCC2), attenuated GABA-mediated hyperpolarization of the non-nociceptive afferent while bumetanide (BUM), an inhibitor of the Cl− importer Na-K-Cl co-transporter isoform 1 (NKCC1), reduced GABA-mediated depolarization of the nociceptive neuron. VU treatment also enhanced P cell synaptic signaling, similar to the previously observed effects of BIC and consistent with the idea that GABA inhibits synaptic signaling at the presynaptic level. BUM treatment depressed N cell synapses, again similar to what is observed following BIC treatment and suggests that GABA has an excitatory effect on these synapses. The opposing effects of GABA could also be observed at the behavioral level with BIC and VU increasing responsiveness to non-nociceptive stimulation while BIC and BUM decreased responsiveness to nociceptive stimulation. These findings demonstrate that distinct synaptic inputs within a shared neural circuit can be differentially modulated by GABA in a functionally relevant manner.

AB  - Abstract
The scope of visual attention changes dynamically over time. Although previous research has reported conditions that suppress peripheral visual processing, no prior work has investigated how attention changes in response to the variable emotional content of audiovisual narratives. We used fMRI to test for the suppression of spatially peripheral stimuli and enhancement of narrative-relevant central stimuli at moments when suspense increased in narrative film excerpts. Participants viewed films presented at fixation, while flashing checkerboards appeared in the periphery. Analyses revealed that increasing narrative suspense caused reduced activity in peripheral visual processing regions in the anterior calcarine sulcus and in default mode network nodes. Concurrently, activity increased in central visual processing regions and in frontal and parietal regions recruited for attention and dynamic visual processing. These results provide evidence, using naturalistic stimuli, of dynamic spatial tuning of attention in early visual processing areas due to narrative context.

AB  - Abstract
Naturally occurring variations in neuropeptide receptor distributions in the brain contribute to numerous mammalian social behaviors. In naked mole-rats, which live in large social groups and exhibit remarkable reproductive skew, colony-related social behaviors vary with reproductive status. Here we examined whether variation in social status is associated with variations in the location and/or density of oxytocin binding in this species. Autoradiography was performed to assess forebrain oxytocin receptor (OTR) densities in breeding and non-breeding naked mole-rats of both sexes. Overall, males exhibited higher OTR binding in the medial amygdala in comparison to females. While there were no main effects of reproductive status in any region, a sex difference in OTR binding in the nucleus accumbens was mediated by status. Specifically, breeding males tended to have more OTR binding than breeding females in the nucleus accumbens, while no sex difference was observed in subordinates. These effects suggest that oxytocin may act in a sex- and region-specific way that corresponds to reproductive status and associated social behaviors.

AB  - Abstract
Identifying novel biomarkers of resilience or vulnerability to stress could provide valuable information for the prevention and treatment of stress-related psychiatric disorders. To investigate the utility of blood microRNAs as biomarkers of resilience or vulnerability to stress, microRNAs were assessed before and after 7 days of chronic social defeat in rats. Additionally, microRNA profiles of two important stress-regulatory brain regions, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), were assessed. Rats that displayed vulnerability to subsequent chronic stress exhibited reductions in circulating miR-24-2-5p, miR-27a-3p, miR-30e-5p, miR-3590-3p, miR-362-3p, and miR-532-5p levels. In contrast, rats that became resilient to stress displayed reduced levels of miR-139-5p, miR-28-3p, miR-326-3p, and miR-99b-5p compared to controls. In the mPFC, miR-126a-3p and miR-708-5p levels were higher in vulnerability compared to resilient rats. In the BLA, 77 microRNAs were significantly altered by stress but none were significantly different between resilient and vulnerable animals. These results provide proof-of-principle that assessment of circulating microRNAs is useful in identifying individuals who are vulnerable to the effects of future stress or individuals who have become resilient to the effects of stress. Furthermore, these data suggest that microRNAs in the mPFC but not in the BLA are regulators of resilience/vulnerability to stress.

AB  - Abstract
Carbon monoxide (CO), like other gaseous neuromodulators, has a dual nature as both a toxic gas and a physiologically relevant signaling molecule. In the nervous system, high concentrations of CO can lead to neuronal injury while lower concentrations are found to be neuroprotective. The number of cellular targets affected by physiological concentrations of CO is rapidly growing and includes ion channels in various cell types. The modulation of ion channels by CO in neurons, however, and the effect it has on neural activity are incompletely understood. Here, the well-characterized buccal neurons, B5 and B19, of the freshwater snail, Helisoma trivolvis, were used to investigate the role that CO plays in regulating spontaneous firing activity and neuronal excitability. Neurons were studied in single-cell culture, thereby removing other signals normally present in the intact nervous system and allowing for the optimal characterization of physiological effects of CO. We found that the CO donor molecule, carbon monoxide releasing molecule-2 (CORM-2), hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential of B5 neurons and silenced their spontaneous firing activity. These effects were mediated through the inhibition of a persistent sodium current. CORM-2 also inhibited neuronal excitability. This effect was mediated by the inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels by CO. The general findings of CO acting as a hyperpolarizing signal and an inhibitor of neuronal excitability extended to B19 neurons. Taken together, these findings suggest that CO is a potent modulator of ion channels with broad implications for the modulation of neural activity in a wide range of neuron-types.

AB  - Abstract
Dorsoventral patterning and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling genes are essential for determining neural identity and differentiation of the Drosophila nervous system. Their role in glial cell development in the Drosophila nervous system is not clearly established. Our study demonstrated that the dorsoventral patterning genes, vnd, ind, and msh, are intrinsically essential for the proper expression of a master glial cell regulator, gcm, and a differentiation gene, repo, in the lateral glia. In addition, we showed that esg is particularly required for their expression in the peripheral glia. These results indicate that the dorsoventral patterning and EGFR signaling genes are essential for identity determination and differentiation of the lateral glia by regulating proper expression of gcm and repo in the lateral glia from the early glial development. In contrast, overexpression of vnd, msh, spi, and Egfr genes repressed the expression of Repo in the ventral neuroectoderm, indicating that maintenance of correct columnar identity along the dorsoventral axis by proper expression of these genes is essential for restrictive formation of glial precursor cells in the lateral neuroectoderm. Therefore, the dorsoventral patterning and EGFR signaling genes play essential roles in correct identity determination and differentiation of lateral glia in the Drosophila nervous system.
