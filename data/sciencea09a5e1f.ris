AB  - Abstract
Many clinical studies have reported on the benefits of exercise therapy in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Exercise cannot stop the progression of PD or facilitate the recovery of dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) (Bega et al., 2014). To tease apart this paradox, we utilized a progressive MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetra-hydropyridine) mouse model in which we initiated 4 weeks of treadmill exercise after the completion of toxin administration (i.e., restoration). We found in our MPTP/exercise (MPTP + EX) group several measures of gait function that recovered compared to the MPTP only group. Although there was a small recovery of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive DA neurons in the SNpc and terminals in the striatum, this increase was not statistically significant. These small changes in TH could not explain the improvement of motor function. The MPTP group had a significant 170% increase in the glycosylated/non-glycosylated dopamine transporter (DAT) and a 200% increase in microglial marker, IBA-1, in the striatum. The MPTP + EX group showed a nearly full recovery of these markers back to the vehicle levels. There was an increase in GLT-1 levels in the striatum due to exercise, with no change in striatal BDNF protein expression. Our data suggest that motor recovery was not prompted by any significant restoration of DA neurons or terminals, but rather the recovery of DAT and dampening the inflammatory response. Although exercise does not promote recovery of nigrostriatal DA, it should be used in conjunction with pharmaceutical methods for controlling PD symptoms.

AB  - Abstract
Social experiences in adolescence are essential for displaying context-appropriate social behaviors in adulthood. We previously found that adult male rats that underwent social instability stress (SS) in adolescence had reduced social interactions with unfamiliar peers compared with non-stressed controls (CTL). Here we determined whether SS altered social recognition and social reward and brain oxytocin and vasopressin receptor density in adolescence. We confirmed that SS rats spent less time interacting with unfamiliar peers than did CTL rats (p = 0.006). Furthermore, CTL rats showed a preference for novel over familiar conspecifics in a social recognition test whereas SS rats did not, which may reflect reduced recognition, impaired memory, or reduced preference for novelty in SS rats. The reward value of social interactions was not affected by SS based on conditioned place preference tests and based on the greater time SS rats spent investigating stimulus rats than did CTL rats when the stimulus rat was behind wire mesh (p = 0.03). Finally, oxytocin receptor binding density was higher in the dorsal lateral septum and nucleus accumbens shell in SS rats compared with CTL rats (p = 0.02, p = 0.01, respectively). No effect of SS was found for vasopressin 1a receptor binding density in any of the brain regions analyzed. We discuss the extent to which the differences in social behavior exhibited after social instability in adolescence involve changes in social salience and social competency, and the possibility that changes in oxytocin signaling in the brain underlie the differences in social behavior.

AB  - Abstract
The causal factors determining the onset and severity of multiple sclerosis (MS) are not well understood. Here, we investigated the influence of chronic stress on clinical symptoms, metabolic and epigenetic manifestations of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a common animal model of MS. Lewis rats were immunized for monophasic EAE with MBP69-88 and were exposed to chronic stress for 37 days starting 7 days prior to immunization. The exposure to stress accelerated and exacerbated the clinical symptoms of EAE. Both stress and EAE also disrupted metabolic status as indicated by trace elemental analysis in body hair. Stress particularly exacerbated chlorine deposition in EAE animals. Moreover, deep sequencing revealed a considerable impact of stress on microRNA expression in EAE. EAE by itself upregulated microRNA expression in lumbar spinal cord, including miR-21, miR-142-3p, miR-142-5p, miR-146a, and miR-155. Stress in EAE further up-regulated miR-16, miR-146a and miR-155 levels. The latter two microRNAs are recognized biomarkers of human MS. Thus, stress may synergistically exacerbate severity of EAE by altering epigenetic regulatory pathways. The findings suggest that stress may represent a significant risk factor for symptomatic deterioration in MS. Stress-related metabolic and microRNA signatures support their value as biomarkers for predicting the risk and severity of MS.

AB  - Abstract
The receptive fields of many auditory cortical neurons are multidimensional and are best represented by more than one stimulus feature. The number of these dimensions, their characteristics, and how they differ with stimulus context have been relatively unexplored. Standard methods that are often used to characterize multidimensional stimulus selectivity, such as spike-triggered covariance (STC) or maximally informative dimensions (MIDs), are either limited to Gaussian stimuli or are only able to recover a small number of stimulus features due to data limitations. An information theoretic extension of STC, the maximum noise entropy (MNE) model, can be used with non-Gaussian stimulus distributions to find an arbitrary number of stimulus dimensions. When we applied the MNE model to auditory cortical neurons, we often found more than two stimulus features that influenced neuronal firing. Excitatory and suppressive features coded different acoustic contexts: excitatory features encoded higher temporal and spectral modulations, while suppressive features had lower modulation frequency preferences. We found that the excitatory and suppressive features themselves were sensitive to stimulus context when we employed two stimuli that differed only in their short-term correlation structure: while the linear features were similar, the secondary features were strongly affected by stimulus statistics. These results show that multidimensional receptive field processing is influenced by feature type and stimulus context.

AB  - Abstract
Prolonged low-level noise exposure alters loudness perception in humans, presumably by decreasing the gain of the central auditory system. Here we test the central gain hypothesis by measuring the acute and chronic physiologic changes at the level of the cochlea and inferior colliculus (IC) after a 75-dB SPL, 10–20-kHz noise exposure for 5 weeks. The compound action potential (CAP) and summating potential (SP) were used to assess the functional status of the cochlea and 16 channel electrodes were used to measure the local field potentials (LFP) and multi-unit spike discharge rates (SDR) from the IC immediately after and one-week post-exposure. Measurements obtained immediately post-exposure demonstrated a significant reduction in supra-threshold CAP amplitudes. In contrast to the periphery, sound-evoked activity in the IC was enhanced in a frequency-dependent manner consistent with models of enhanced central gain. Surprisingly, one-week post-exposure supra-threshold responses from the cochlea had not only recovered, but were significantly larger than normal, and thresholds were significantly better than controls. Moreover, sound-evoked hyperactivity in the IC was sustained within the noise exposure frequency band but suppressed at higher frequencies. When response amplitudes representing the neural output of the cochlea and IC activity at one-week post exposure were compared with control animal responses, a central attenuation phenomenon becomes evident, which may play a key role in understanding why low-level noise can sometimes ameliorate tinnitus and hyperacusis percepts.

AB  - Abstract
12/15 Lipoxygenase has recently been described as potent propagator of oxidative stress and is closely associated with cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases. The mechanism/s behind 12/15 LOX involvement in cognitive deficits remain obscure. The current study has been designed to investigate the underlying role of 12/15LOX and effect of 12/15 LOX inhibition on hypobaric hypoxia-induced memory impairment and cholinergic deficits. Male Balb/c mice subjected to simulated hypobaric hypoxia/reoxygenation condition for 3 days showed marked working memory impairment concomitant with hippocampal neuronal damage and malondialdehyde production which were significantly attenuated by baicalein, a specific inhibitor of 12/15LOX. Hypobaric hypoxia-exposed mice had consistently increased expression of 12/15LOX and elevated 12(S) HETE levels in the hippocampus as well as plasma which were significantly mitigated following baicalein treatment. 12/15LOX inhibition also reduced hypobaric hypoxia-mediated upregulation of hippocampal HIF-1α protein expression along with reduction in expression of inflammatory genes. The inhibition of 12/15 LOX resulted in a significant decrease in NO levels in the hippocampal homogenate associated with downregulated iNOS, nNOS transcription but not eNOS speculating that 12/15 LOX is critically involved in HIF-1α, mediated by nitric oxide-induced neurotoxicity. We also observed a similar effect of 12/15 LOX inhibition on hippocampal COX2 expression. 12/15LOX inhibition could effectively modulate central cholinergic indices during hypobaric hypoxia by restoring mAChR-1, α7NAChR expression and AChE, ChAT activity in the hippocampus comparable to normal mice. We report here the mechanistic involvement of 12/15LOX in orchestrating hypoxia-associated neuronal damage and HIF-1α-dependent neuroinflammation resulting in cognitive decline.

AB  - Abstract
Studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) in postmortem brain tissue report enhanced binding to inhibitory serotonin-1A autoreceptors in midbrain dorsal raphe and reductions in length of axons expressing the serotonin transporter (SERT) in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The length density of axons expressing SERT in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) was determined in 18 subjects with MDD and 17 age-matched control subjects. A monoclonal antibody was used to immunohistochemically label the SERT in fixed sections of OFC. The 3-dimensional length density of SERT-immunoreactive (ir) axons in layer VI of OFC was estimated. The age of subjects with MDD was negatively correlated with SERT axon length (r = −0.77, p &lt; 0.0005). The significant effect of age persisted when removing four depressed subjects with an antidepressant medication present at the time of death, or when removing nine depressed subjects that had a recent prescription for an antidepressant medication. Neither gender, tissue pH, postmortem interval, 5-HTTLPR genotype, time in fixative, nor death by suicide had a significant effect on axon length. The age-related decrease in SERT-ir axon length in MDD may reflect pathology of ascending axons passing through deep white matter hyperintensities. Greater length of axons expressing SERT in younger subjects with MDD may result in a significant deficit in serotonin availability in OFC.

AB  - Abstract
Explicit negative attitudes toward obese individuals are well documented and seem to modulate the activity of perceptual areas, such as the Extrastriate Body Area (EBA) in the lateral occipito-temporal cortex, which is critical for body-shape perception. Nevertheless, it is still unclear whether EBA serves a role in implicit weight-stereotypical bias, thus reflecting stereotypical trait attribution on the basis of perceptual cues. Here, we used an Implicit Association Test (IAT) to investigate whether applying transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over bilateral extrastriate visual cortex reduces pre-existing implicit weight stereotypical associations (i.e. “Bad” with Fat and “Good” with Slim, valence-IAT). Furthermore, an esthetic-IAT, which focused on body-concepts related to esthetic dimensions (i.e. “Ugly” and “Beauty”), was developed as a control condition. Anodal, cathodal, or sham tDCS (2 mA, 10 min) over the right and left lateral occipito-temporal (extrastriate visual) cortex was administered to 13 female and 12 male participants, before performing the IATs. Results showed that cathodal stimulation over the left extrastriate visual cortex reduced weight-bias for the evaluative dimensions (Bad vs. Good) as compared to sham stimulation over the same hemisphere. Furthermore, the effect was specific for the polarity and hemisphere of stimulation. Importantly, tDCS affected the responses only in male participants, who presented a reliable weight-bias during sham condition, but not in female participants, who did not show reliable weight-bias at sham condition. The present results suggest that negative attitudes toward obese individuals may reflect neural signals from the extrastriate visual cortex.

AB  - Abstract
Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a potentially disabling condition encompassing all delayed, persistent, and often irreversible abnormal involuntary movements arising in a fraction of subjects during long-term exposure to centrally acting dopamine receptor-blocking agents such as antipsychotic drugs and metoclopramide. However, the pathogenesis of TD has proved complex and remains elusive. To investigate the mechanism underlying the development of TD, we have chronically exposed 17 Cebus apella monkeys to typical (11) or atypical (6) antipsychotic drugs. Six additional monkeys were used as controls. Using autoradiography, Western blot and in situ hybridization techniques, we compared neurochemical components of the dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate neurotransmitter systems modulating striatal activity in monkeys chronically exposed to haloperidol and clozapine. Five (5) out of 11 monkeys treated with haloperidol develop TD, whereas none of the monkeys treated with clozapine develop TD. Haloperidol treatment significantly upregulated the levels of serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, NR2A-containing NMDA receptors, and tyrosine hydroxylase contents in the monkey putamen, whereas clozapine regulated putamen NMDA receptor levels and tyrosine hydroxylase contents, and 5-HT2A and dopamine transporter outside the putamen. Comparisons of neurochemical alterations between dyskinetic and non dyskinetic animals within the haloperidol-treated group indicate that modulations of 5-HT2A, metabotropic glutamate type 5, NR2A- and NR2B-containing NMDA receptors, and vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 levels were restricted to the non dyskinetic group. The foregoing results suggest that TD is associated with complex deficient adaptation in aminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in the striatum of non-human primates chronically exposed to antipsychotic drugs.

AB  - Abstract
Adolescence has been identified as a vulnerable developmental time period during which exposure to drugs can have long-lasting, detrimental effects. Although adolescent binge-like ethanol (EtOH) exposure leads to a significant reduction in forebrain cholinergic neurons, EtOH’s functional effect on acetylcholine (ACh) release during behavior has yet to be examined. Using an adolescent intermittent ethanol exposure model (AIE), rats were exposed to binge-like levels of EtOH from postnatal days (PD) 25 to 55. Three weeks following the final EtOH exposure, cholinergic functioning was assessed during a spontaneous alternation protocol. During maze testing, ACh levels increased in both the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. However, selectively in the prefrontal cortex, AIE rats displayed reduced levels of behaviorally relevant ACh efflux. We found no treatment differences in spatial exploration, spatial learning, spatial reversal, or novel object recognition. In contrast, AIE rats were impaired during the first attentional set shift on an operant set-shifting task, indicative of an EtOH-mediated deficit in cognitive flexibility. A unique pattern of cholinergic cell loss was observed in the basal forebrain following AIE: Within the medial septum/diagonal band there was a selective loss (30%) of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive neurons that were nestin negative (ChAT+/nestin−); whereas in the Nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM) there was a selective reduction (50%) in ChAT+/nestin+. These results indicate that early adolescent binge EtOH exposure leads to a long-lasting frontocortical functional cholinergic deficit, driven by a loss of ChAT+/nestin+ neurons in the NbM, which was associated with impaired cognitive flexibility during adulthood.

AB  - Abstract
Successful response inhibition relies on the suppression of motor cortex activity. The striatum has previously been linked to motor cortex suppression during the act of inhibition (reactive), but activation was also seen during anticipation of stop signals (proactive). More specifically, striatal activation increased with a higher stop probability. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging with specific regions of interest, we investigate for the first time whether activation in the striatum during reactive inhibition is related to previously formed expectations. We used a modified stop-signal response task in which subjects were asked trial by trial, after being presented a stop-signal probability cue, whether they actually expected a stop to occur. This enabled us to investigate the subjective expectation of a stop signal during each trial. We found that striatal activity during reactive inhibition was higher when subjects expected stop signals. These results help explain conflicting findings of previous studies on the association between striatal activation and inhibition, since we demonstrate a crucial role of the subjects’ expectation of a stop signal and thus their ability to prepare for a stop in advance. In conclusion, the current results show for the first time that striatal contributions to reactive response inhibition are, in part, related to subjective anticipation.

AB  - Abstract
Choline is essential to the development and function of the central nervous system and supplemental choline during development is neuroprotective against a variety of insults, including neurotoxins like dizocilpine (MK-801). MK-801 is an NMDA receptor antagonist that is frequently used in rodent models of psychological disorders, particularly schizophrenia. At low doses, it causes cognitive impairments, and at higher doses it induces motor deficits, anhedonia, and neuronal degeneration. The primary goals of the present study were to investigate whether prenatal choline supplementation protects against the cognitive impairments, motor deficits, and neuropathologies that are precipitated by MK-801 administration in adulthood. Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were fed a standard or supplemented choline diet prenatally. Using the novelty preference test of object recognition, we found that only prenatal standard-fed rats displayed memory consolidation deficits induced by low-dose MK-801 administered immediately following study of sample objects; all other groups, including prenatal choline supplemented rats given MK-801, showed intact memory. Following high-dose MK-801, prenatal choline supplementation significantly alleviated rats’ motor response to MK-801, particularly ataxia. Using doublecortin and Ki67 to mark neurogenesis and cell division, respectively, in the hippocampus, we found that prenatal choline supplementation, in the face of MK-801 toxicity, protected against reduced hippocampal plasticity. Taken together, the current findings suggest that prenatal choline supplementation protects against a variety of behavioral and neural pathologies induced by the neurotoxin, MK-801. This research contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the robust neuroprotective capacity of choline.

AB  - Abstract
In the neocortex, interaction and cooperation between different areas are important for information processing, which also applies to different areas within one sensory modality. In the temporal cortex of rodents and cats, both the primary auditory cortex (A1) and the anterior auditory field (AAF) have tonotopicity but with a mirrored frequency gradient. However, whether and how A1 modulates the responses in AAF is largely unknown. Here, we functionally identified the locations of A1 and AAF in rats and used an optogenetic approach to manipulate the activity of A1 in vivo. We found that activation of A1 axon terminals in AAF did not change AAF responses, but activating A1 neuronal cell bodies could increase the sound-evoked responses in AAF, as well as decrease the intensity threshold and broaden the frequency bandwidth, while suppressing A1 could cause the opposite effects. Our results suggested that A1 could modulate the general excitability of AAF through indirect pathways, which provides a potential relationship between these two parallel auditory ascending pathways.

AB  - Abstract
Adverse effects of nicotine during pregnancy have been greatly studied, while nowadays few works are focused on consequences of maternal tobacco smoking after birth. The present study investigated the behavioral and early neurochemical effects of nicotine treatment during first weeks of post-natal life in rats. We used “free choice” treatment (H2O + NIC dams could drink from two bottles, containing 10 mg/L nicotine hydrogen tartrate salt, or water) versus “forced choice” (NIC + NIC mothers could drink from two bottles both containing nicotine hydrogen tartrate salt, range from 0.75 mg/L to 4.09 mg/L). We found that only “forced nicotine” had impact on maternal behavior, causing increased high-quality maternal care. This immediately impacted on neuro-chemical development, affecting NE levels (only males) in pup’s striatum and prefrontal cortex (pFC) at PND 12. After weaning, animals were reared in normal conditions (two brother rats) or in Social Isolation. After two weeks, they were tested with Social Interaction Test (isolated rats met non-isolated opponents, siblings vs. non-siblings). As expected, isolated rats displayed an aggressive form of soliciting behavior: when facing an isolated unknown partner, the non-isolated rat tried to escape. Interestingly, if their dams were exposed to forced nicotine, both rats sooner behaved very affiliative (possibly empathic) between non-sibling partners. As expected, being exposed to post-natal nicotine could alter neuro-chemical development, but with important interactions between both maternal care and adolescent social behavior.

AB  - Abstract
Whether the CD38/cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) pathway plays a protective or detrimental role in neuroinflammation remains controversial. This study aimed to determine the role of CD38 in neuroinflammation using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2 microglial cells and co-cultured Neuro-2a (N2a) cells. In monoculture experiments, BV2 cells were divided into control, CD38 interference (CD38Ri), negative control (NC), LPS, CD38Ri + LPS, NC + LPS and 8-Br-cADPR + LPS groups. In co-culture experiments, N2a cells were co-cultured with BV2 cells for 48 h. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), cADPR and intracellular Ca2+ levels and CD38 expression increased significantly in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells. CD38 knockdown or 8-Br-cADPR treatment significantly reduced NAD+, cADPR and intracellular Ca2+ levels. CD38 knockdown increased iNOS and NO levels in BV2 cells without LPS treatment; however, CD38 knockdown or 8-Br-cADPR treatment reduced iNOS and NO levels in BV2 cells with LPS treatment. CD38 knockdown increased the ratio of TUNEL-positive cells and cleaved Caspase 3/Caspase 3 ratio, and decreased the Bcl-2/Bax ratio in BV2 cells without LPS treatment; however, CD38 knockdown reduced the TUNEL positivity in BV2 cells with LPS treatment. CD38 knockdown or 8-Br-cADPR inhibited TNF-α, IL-6 (interleukin-6) and IL-1β levels in LPS-stimulated BV2 cells. Co-culture with CD38 knockdown or 8-Br-cADPR-treated BV2 cells did not influence apoptosis or iNOS expression in N2a cells. In conclusion, our results indicate that blocking the CD38/cADPR pathway reduces intracellular Ca2+, NO and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. CD38 knockdown exerted a detrimental effect in apoptosis and NO production in normal microglia, but played a protective role in apoptosis and NO production in LPS-stimulated microglia.

AB  - Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common late onset neurodegenerative disorder with indications that women are disproportionately affected. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been one of the most discussed hypotheses associated with the early onset and progression of AD, and it has been attributed to intraneuronal accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ). It was suggested that one of the possible mediators for Aβ-impaired mitochondrial function is the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. NF-κB plays important roles in brain inflammation and antioxidant defense, as well as in the regulation of mitochondrial function, and studies have confirmed altered NF-κB signaling in AD brain. In this study, we looked for sex-based differences in impaired bioenergetic processes and NF-κB signaling in the AD-like brain using transgenic (Tg) CRND8 mice that express excessive brain Aβ, but without tau pathology. Our results show that mitochondrial dysfunction is not uniform in affected brain regions. We observed increased basal and coupled respiration in the hippocampus of TgCRND8 females only, along with a decreased Complex II-dependent respiratory activity. Cortical mitochondria from TgCRND8 mice have reduced uncoupled respiration capacity, regardless of sex. The pattern of changes in NF-κB signaling was the same in both brain structures, but was sex specific. Whereas in females there was an increase in all three subunits of NF-κB, in males we observed increase in p65 and p105, but no changes in p50 levels. These results demonstrate that mitochondrial function and inflammatory signaling in the AD-like brain is region- and sex-specific, which is an important consideration for therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Abstract
Sites and mechanisms by which trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) exerts beneficial effects on symptoms of drug-resistant epilepsy and depression are still unknown. Effects of short-term TNS on brain regions involved in the physiopathology of these disorders were investigated in this study.

Forty male rats were assigned to three groups: TNS (undergoing electrical stimulation of the left infraorbitary nerve via surgically implanted cuff electrodes); Sham (undergoing surgical procedure but without a stimulation); Naïve rats. The effects of TNS (3-hour session; 30-s ON, 5-min OFF; 30 Hz; 500 μs; 2 mA) were evaluated on: (i) behavioral pattern of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures as measured by the Racine scale; (ii) c-Fos-like immunoreactivity in discrete brain areas; (iii) hippocampal cell proliferation by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-like immunoreactivity.

In comparison with Sham groups, TNS significantly decreased the duration of PTZ-induced seizures (p &lt; 0.05) and promoted a faster recovery (p &lt; 0.001) by reducing the most severe seizure types. In the TNS group the number of c-Fos-labeled cells was significantly increased (p &lt; 0.001) in the trigeminal nuclear complex, nucleus of the solitary tract, locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, hippocampus, amygdala, endopiriform nucleus, entorhinal cortex and sensorimotor cortex. In the TNS group the number of BrdU-positive cells in the dentate gyrus was significantly greater with respect to both Naïve and Sham groups.

Data show that acute TNS effectively counteracted PTZ-induced seizures and boosted hippocampal cell proliferation in rats. TNS increased c-Fos-like immunoreactivity in brainstem and forebrain structures which play a pivotal role in the physiopathology of epilepsy and depression.

AB  - Abstract
Following tissue injury, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in the primary afferent neurons drives sensitization of peripheral nerve. Dexmedetomidine extends the duration of reginal analgesia by local anesthetics. The effect of regional analgesia on the peripheral nerve sensitization is not known. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of regional analgesia by levobupivacaine with or without dexmedetomidine on the p38 MAPK phosphorylation in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and inflammatory reaction in the peripheral tissue.

A plantar incision was made in the hind paws of Sprague–Dawley rats. Prior to incision, levobupivacaine with or without dexmedetomidine was injected to the plantar aspect of the paws and ankles. A behavioral study was performed to investigate pain hypersensitivity. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in the DRG was assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Macrophage accumulation, NGF, and TNF-α in the DRG and plantar tissue were measured using immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR and ELISA.

Pain hypersensitivity was induced immediately after the plantar incision. Treatment with levobupivacaine inhibited the development of pain hypersensitivity for two hours. Adjunctive dexmedetomidine extended the anti-hyperalgesic duration for four hours. Levobupivacaine without dexmedetomidine could not inhibit p38 MAPK phosphorylation in the DRG completely. However, Levobupivacaine and dexmedetomidine completely inhibited p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and reduced macrophage accumulation and TNF-α amount in the plantar tissue.

Inhibition of p38 MAPK phosphorylation via TNF-α suggests dexmedetomidine has a peripheral mechanism of anti-inflammatory action when used as an adjunct to local anesthetics, and provides a molecular basis for the prevention of peripheral sensitization following surgery.

AB  - Abstract
RNA binding motif 5 (RBM5) is a nuclear protein that modulates gene transcription and mRNA splicing in cancer cells. The brain is among the highest RBM5-expressing organ in the body but its mRNA target(s) or functions in the CNS have not been elucidated. Here we knocked down (KO) RBM5 in primary rat cortical neurons and analyzed total RNA extracts by gene microarray vs. neurons transduced with lentivirus to deliver control (non-targeting) shRNA. The mRNA levels of Sec23A (involved in ER-Golgi transport) and the small GTPase Rab4a (involved in endocytosis/protein trafficking) were increased in RBM5 KO neurons relative to controls. At the protein level, only Rab4a was significantly increased in RBM5 KO extracts. Also, elevated Rab4a levels in KO neurons were associated with decreased membrane levels of oligomeric serotonin transporters (SERT). Finally, RBM5 KO was associated with increased uptake of membrane-derived monomeric SERT. Significance: Rab4a is involved in the regulation of endocytosis and protein trafficking in cells. In the CNS it regulates diverse neurobiological functions including (but not limited to) trafficking of transmembrane proteins involved in neurotransmission (e.g. SERT), maintaining dendritic spine size, promoting axonal growth, and modulating cognition. Our findings suggest that RBM5 regulates Rab4a in rat neurons.

AB  - Abstract
The pathological hallmark of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), and the resulting striatal dopamine deficiency, which are responsible for the classic motor features. Although a diagnosis of PD relies on the clinical effects of dopamine deficiency, this disease is also associated with other neurotransmitter deficits that are recognized as causing various motor and non-motor symptoms. However, the cause of dopaminergic nigral neurodegeneration in PD and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. While animal models are considered valuable tools with which to investigate dopaminergic cell vulnerability, rodent models usually fail to mimic the neurodegeneration progression that occurs in human PD.

To find a convenient rat model for studying the progression of dopaminergic cell degeneration and motor signs, we have developed a progressive rodent model using a repeated daily, intraventricular administration of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) (100 µg/day) in awakened rats for 1 to 10 consecutive days. The short- (6-day) and long-term (32-day) progression of motor alterations was studied. This model leads to a bilateral and progressive increase in catalepsy (evident from the 3rd infusion in the short-term groups (p &lt; 0.01) and from the 7th infusion in the long-term groups (p &lt; 0.01), which was associated with a progressive nigrostriatal dopaminergic deficit. All together this makes the new model an interesting experimental tool to investigate the mechanisms involved in the progression of dopaminergic neurodegeneration.

AB  - Abstract
Better cognitive performance and greater cortical and hippocampal volume have been observed in individuals who undertook aerobic exercise during childhood and adolescence. One possible explanation for these beneficial effects is that juvenile physical exercise enables better neural development and hence more cells and neuronal circuitries. It is probable that such effects occur through intracellular signaling proteins associated with cell growth, proliferation and survival. Based on this information, we evaluated the number of neuronal and non-neuronal cells using isotropic fractionation and the expression and activation of intracellular proteins (ERK, CREB, Akt, mTOR and p70S6K) in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal formation of the rats submitted to a physical exercise program on a treadmill during adolescence. Results showed that physical exercise increases the number of neuronal and non-neuronal cortical cells and hippocampal neuronal cells in adolescent rats. Moreover, mTOR overexpression was found in the cortical region of exercised adolescent rats. These findings indicate a significant cellular proliferative effect of aerobic exercise on the cerebral cortex in postnatal development.

AB  - Abstract
Because of their difficulties with figurative language in conversation, it is commonly thought that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) do not understand figurative meaning. However, recent research indicates that individuals with and without ASD are similar in the first two stages of metaphor comprehension, up to and including successful generation of the figurative meaning. In the current study, we used a sentence decision task to evaluate the subsequent stage of metaphor comprehension, the selection stage, which requires suppression/inhibition of the unintended meaning as part of selecting the intended meaning. fMRI activation and functional connectivity were used to compare the selection stage of metaphor comprehension between high-functioning individuals with ASD and carefully matched controls. Cortical and subcortical regions of interest were selected based on the basal-ganglia model of cognitive control. Compared to controls, individuals with ASD recruited greater activation in regions related to verbal memory (thalamus), semantic associations (medial temporal gyrus), and basic visual processing (middle occipital gyrus). Functional connectivity analysis revealed fewer overall connections and cortical–subcortical connections in the ASD group compared to controls. There was a novel finding of maintenance of subcortical–subcortical connectivity in the ASD group, specific to the selection condition, despite differences in cortically involved connections. Reduced cortical–subcortical connectivity in the ASD group compared to controls may reflect a more global impairment in cognitive control pathways, while consistent subcortical–subcortical connectivity may reflect systemic inflexibility or preserved subcortical function and dissociation between subcortical and cortical systems. Further investigation is required.

AB  - Abstract
Sestrin 2 (SESN2) is a stress-inducible protein that protects tissues from oxidative stress and delays the aging process. However, its role in maintaining the functional and structural integrity of the cochlea is largely unknown. Here, we report the expression of SESN2 protein in the sensory epithelium, particularly in hair cells. Using C57BL/6J mice, a mouse model of age-related cochlear degeneration, we observed a significant age-related reduction in SESN2 expression in cochlear tissues that was associated with early onset hearing loss and accelerated age-related sensory cell degeneration that progressed from the base toward the apex of the cochlea. Hair cell death occurred by caspase-8 mediated apoptosis. Compared to C57BL/6J control mice, Sesn2 KO mice displayed enhanced expression of proinflammatory genes and activation of basilar membrane macrophages, suggesting that loss of SESN2 function provokes the immune response. Together, these results suggest that Sesn2 plays an important role in cochlear homeostasis and immune responses to stress.

AB  - Abstract
Personality neuroscience defines the scientific study of the neurobiological basis of personality. This field assumes that individual differences in personality traits are related with structural and functional variations of the human brain. Gray and white matters are structural properties considered separately in previous research. Available findings in this regard are largely disparate. Here we analyze the relationships between gray matter (cortical thickness (CT), cortical surface area (CSA), and cortical volume) and integrity scores obtained after several white matter tracts connecting different brain regions, with individual differences in the personality traits comprised by the Five-Factor Model (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience). These psychological and biological data were obtained from young healthy women. The main findings showed statistically significant associations between occipital CSA variations and extraversion, as well as between parietal CT variations and neuroticism. Regarding white matter integrity, openness showed positive correlations with tracts connecting posterior and anterior brain regions. Therefore, variations in discrete gray matter clusters were associated with temperamental traits (extraversion and neuroticism), whereas long-distance structural connections were related with the dimension of personality that has been associated with high-level cognitive processes (openness).

AB  - Abstract
Dense reciprocal connections link the rat anterior thalamic nuclei with the prelimbic, anterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices, as well as with the subiculum and postsubiculum. The present study compared the ipsilateral thalamic-cortical connections with the corresponding crossed, contralateral connections between these same sets of regions. All efferents from the anteromedial thalamic nucleus to the cortex, as well as those to the subiculum, remained ipsilateral. In contrast, all of these target sites provided reciprocal, bilateral projections to the anteromedial nucleus. While the anteroventral thalamic nucleus often shared this same asymmetric pattern of cortical connections, it received relatively fewer crossed inputs than the anteromedial nucleus. This difference was most marked for the anterior cingulate projections, as those to the anteroventral nucleus remained almost entirely ipsilateral. Unlike the anteromedial nucleus, the anteroventral nucleus also appeared to provide a restricted, crossed projection to the contralateral retrosplenial cortex. Meanwhile, the closely related laterodorsal thalamic nucleus had almost exclusively ipsilateral efferent and afferent cortical connections. Likewise, within the hippocampus, the postsubiculum seemingly had only ipsilateral efferent and afferent connections with the anterior thalamic and laterodorsal nuclei. While the bilateral cortical projections to the anterior thalamic nuclei originated predominantly from layer VI, the accompanying sparse projections from layer V largely gave rise to ipsilateral thalamic inputs. In testing a potentially unifying principle of anterior thalamic – cortical interactions, a slightly more individual pattern emerged that reinforces other evidence of functional differences within the anterior thalamic and also helps to explain the consequences of unilateral interventions involving these nuclei.

AB  - Abstract
Increases in plasma osmolality activates the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) which in turn mounts a physiological response by increasing the release of arginine vasopressin and sympathetic nerve activity to end organs such as the kidney. The PVN expresses an abundance of purinergic receptors including P2X2 receptors. In the present study, we sought to determine (1) whether P2X2-expressing PVN neurons are activated by hypertonic saline or hypertonic mannitol and (2) what effects P2X receptor blockade has on sympathetic nerve activation mediated by a hyperosmotic stimulus. Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to three groups and intravenously infused with either isotonic saline (0.154 M, 0.5 mL), hypertonic saline (3 M, 0.5 mL) or hypertonic mannitol (10% w/v, 0.5 mL). Significantly greater numbers of Fos-positive cells were observed in the hypertonic saline (393 ± 29)- and hypertonic mannitol (141 ± 11)-infused rats compared with control, saline-treated, rats (47 ± 2 neurons/PVN section). Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the number of activated (Fos-positive) P2X2 expressing PVN neurons in the hypertonic saline (65 ± 7) and hypertonic mannitol (37 ± 7)-treated rats compared with controls (16 ± 2). Microinjection of a P2X receptor antagonist, PPADS, within the PVN significantly attenuated sympathetic nerve activation driven by a hyperosmotic stimulus. The hyperosmotically induced increase in lumbar sympathetic nerve activity was significantly blunted after PPADS pre-treatment. Collectively, our findings indicate that hyperosmotic stimulation activates a subset of P2X2 expressing PVN neurons that might facilitate increased sympathetic drive.

AB  - Abstract
The central auditory nervous system (CANS) undergoes language-dependent tuning to enhance linguistically relevant features of sound. However, less is known about how dual-language exposure affects the CANS. Recent reports indicate that Spanish-English bilingual children and adolescents have larger neural responses to the fundamental frequency (F0) of vowels, as measured by the frequency-following response (FFR), a phase-locked response to sound. Given the cross-language significance of F0, this led us to hypothesize that enhanced neural responses to the F0 are not unique to Spanish-English bilingual children and adolescents but are instead a common feature of a CANS with significant early dual language experience. In support of this hypothesis, we found that early bilingual adults, representing more than a dozen languages, had more robust FFRs to the F0 compared to English-language monolinguals suggesting that bilingual experience imprints on the CANS in a similar fashion regardless of the languages of exposure. Taken together, our results suggest that early exposure to two linguistic sound systems primes the brain to respond to the F0, a basic feature of all speech sounds that signals important indexical information for vowel, talker, and language identification.

AB  - Abstract
Alteration in gene expression along the pain signaling pathway is a key mechanism contributing to the genesis of neuropathic pain. Accumulating studies have shown that epigenetic regulation plays a crucial role in nociceptive process in the spinal dorsal horn. In this present study, we investigated the role of enhancer of zeste homolog-2 (EZH2), a subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2, in the spinal dorsal horn in the genesis of neuropathic pain in rats induced by partial sciatic nerve ligation. EZH2 is a histone methyltransferase, which catalyzes the methylation of histone H3 on K27 (H3K27), resulting in gene silencing. We found that levels of EZH2 and tri-methylated H3K27 (H3K27TM) in the spinal dorsal horn were increased in rats with neuropathic pain on day 3 and day 10 post nerve injuries. EZH2 was predominantly expressed in neurons in the spinal dorsal horn under normal conditions. The number of neurons with EZH2 expression was increased after nerve injury. More strikingly, nerve injury drastically increased the number of microglia with EZH2 expression by more than sevenfold. Intrathecal injection of the EZH2 inhibitor attenuated the development and maintenance of mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in rats with nerve injury. Such analgesic effects were concurrently associated with the reduced levels of EZH2, H3K27TM, Iba1, GFAP, TNF-α, IL-1β, and MCP-1 in the spinal dorsal horn in rats with nerve injury. Our results highly suggest that targeting the EZH2 signaling pathway could be an effective approach for the management of neuropathic pain.

AB  - Abstract
Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an important RNA-binding protein responsible for fragile X syndrome, is involved in posttranscriptional control of gene expression that links with brain development and synaptic functions. Here, we reveal a novel role of FMRP in pre-mRNA alternative splicing, a general event of posttranscriptional regulation. Using co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays, we identified that FMRP interacts with an alternative-splicing-associated protein RNA-binding protein 14 (RBM14) in a RNA-dependent fashion, and the two proteins partially colocalize in the nuclei of hippocampal neurons. We show that the relative skipping/inclusion ratio of the micro-exon L in the Protrudin gene and exon 10 in the Tau gene decreased in the hippocampus of Fmr1 knockout (KO) mice. Knockdown of either FMRP or RBM14 alters the relative skipping/inclusion ratio of Protrudin and Tau in cultured Neuro-2a cells, similar to that in the Fmr1 KO mice. Furthermore, overexpression of FMRP leads to an opposite pattern of the splicing, which can be offset by RBM14 knockdown. RNA immunoprecipitation assays indicate that FMRP promotes RBM14’s binding to the mRNA targets. In addition, overexpression of the long form of Protrudin or the short form of Tau promotes protrusion growth of the retinoic acid-treated, neuronal-differentiated Neuro-2a cells. Together, these data suggest a novel function of FMRP in the regulation of pre-mRNA alternative splicing through RBM14 that may be associated with normal brain function and FMRP-related neurological disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Humans perform object recognition effortlessly and accurately. However, it is unknown how the visual system copes with variations in objects’ appearance and the environmental conditions. Previous studies have suggested that affine variations such as size and position are compensated for in the feed-forward sweep of visual information processing while feedback signals are needed for precise recognition when encountering non-affine variations such as pose and lighting. Yet, no empirical data exist to support this suggestion. We systematically investigated the impact of the above-mentioned affine and non-affine variations on the categorization performance of the feed-forward mechanisms of the human brain. For that purpose, we designed a backward-masking behavioral categorization paradigm as well as a passive viewing EEG recording experiment. On a set of varying stimuli, we found that the feed-forward visual pathways contributed more dominantly to the compensation of variations in size and position compared to lighting and pose. This was reflected in both the amplitude and the latency of the category separability indices obtained from the EEG signals. Using a feed-forward computational model of the ventral visual stream, we also confirmed a more dominant role for the feed-forward visual mechanisms of the brain in the compensation of affine variations. Taken together, our experimental results support the theory that non-affine variations such as pose and lighting may need top-down feedback information from higher areas such as IT and PFC for precise object recognition.

AB  - Abstract
The metabolic pathophysiology underlying ischemic stroke remains poorly understood. To gain insight into these mechanisms, we performed a comparative metabolic and transcriptional analysis of the effects of cerebral ischemia on the metabolism of the cerebral cortex using middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model. Metabolic profiling by gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry analysis showed clear separation between the ischemia and control group. The decreases of fructose 6-phosphate and ribulose 5-phosphate suggested enhancement of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) during cerebral ischemia (120-min MCAO) without reperfusion. Transcriptional profiling by microarray hybridization indicated that the Toll-like receptor and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways were upregulated during cerebral ischemia without reperfusion. In relation to the PPP, upregulation of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) was observed in the MAPK signaling pathway and was confirmed through real-time polymerase chain reaction. Immunoblotting showed a slight increase in HSP27 protein expression and a marked increase in HSP27 phosphorylation at serine 85 after 60-min and 120-min MCAO without reperfusion. Corresponding upregulation of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity and an increase in the NADPH/NAD+ ratio were also observed after 120-min MCAO. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular injection of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase inhibitor (KU-55933) significantly reduced HSP27 phosphorylation and G6PD upregulation after MCAO, but that of protein kinase D inhibitor (CID755673) did not affect HSP27 phosphorylation. Consequently, G6PD activation via ischemia-induced HSP27 phosphorylation by ATM kinase may be part of an endogenous antioxidant defense neuroprotection mechanism during the earliest stages of ischemia. These findings have important therapeutic implications for the treatment of stroke.

Conduct disorder (CD) is a developmental disorder defined by a repetitive and persistent display of antisocial and aggressive behaviors that violates the rights of others or basic social rules. Recently, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) has been widely adopted to investigate the altered intrinsic neural activities and the disrupted endogenous brain connectivity of CD. In this study, functional connectivity density (FCD) mapping, a newly developed ultrafast voxel-wise method based on rsfMRI, was applied for the first time to examine the changes in the brain functional connectivity in CD at the voxel level. We assessed the differences in FCD between eighteen male adolescents with CD and eighteen typically-developing (TD) individuals. Then, the identified brain regions in which CD patients and healthy controls exhibited significant difference in FCD were extracted to calculate the correlations between measures of FCD values and clinical data. We discovered that compared to healthy controls, CD patients showed increased short-range FCD in the default-mode network including the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the bilateral precuneus (PCUN). More importantly, increased short-range FCD values in the bilateral PCC, the bilateral PCUN, and increased long-range FCD values in the left MCC showed significant correlations with the impulsivity. Overall, these results suggested that the FCD abnormalities in CD patients occurred in brain regions known to be involved in cognition, emotion and visual perception.

AB  - Abstract
We investigated the effect of progesterone (P4) treatment on diabetes/hyperglycemia-induced pathological changes in brain, spinal cord and sciatic nerve tissue in male rats. Animals were rendered hyperglycemic by a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ). P4 treatment was started after hyperglycemia was confirmed and body weight and blood glucose levels were monitored once/week for 5 weeks. Rats underwent behavioral testing at week 5 and were then euthanized for histology. We assessed the expression of markers of angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)), inflammation (interleukin-6 (IL-6)) and tissue injury (CD11b, NG2, COX2 and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2)) in the brain, spinal cord and sciatic nerve. We also examined the regenerative effect of P4 on pathological changes in intra-epidermal nerve fibers (IENF) of the footpads. Diabetes/hyperglycemia led to body weight loss over 5 weeks and P4 treatment reduced this loss. At week 5, blood-glucose levels were significantly lower in the P4-treated diabetic group compared to vehicle. Compared to sham or P4-treated groups, the diabetic vehicle group showed hyperactivity on the spontaneous locomotor activity test. Western blot data revealed upregulation of VEGF, IL-6, CD11b, NG2, COX2 and MMP-2 levels in the vehicle group and P4 treatment normalized these expression levels. IENF densities were reduced in the vehicle group and normalized after P4 treatment. We conclude that P4 can reduce some of the chronic pathological responses to STZ-induced diabetes.

AB  - Abstract
Aging is associated with changes in numerous homeostatic functions, such as food intake, that are thought to be mediated by the hypothalamus. Orexin/hypocretin neurons of the hypothalamus regulate several physiological functions, including feeding, sleep and wakefulness. Evidence from both clinical and animal studies supports the notion that aging is associated with loss or dysregulation of the orexin system. Here, we used virus-mediated gene transfer to manipulate expression of orexin peptides in young and aged rats and examined behavioral and neurochemical correlates of food intake in these animals. Aged rats showed slower feeding latencies when presented with palatable food compared to young control rats, and these deficits were ameliorated by upregulation of orexin expression. Similarly, young animals treated with a virus designed to decrease preproorexin expression showed longer feeding latencies reminiscent of aged control rats. Feeding was also associated with increased acetylcholine, glutamate and GABA efflux in insular cortex of young control animals. Orexin upregulation did not restore deficits in feeding-elicited release of these neurotransmitters in aged rats, but did enhance basal neurotransmitter levels which may have contributed to the behavioral correlates of these genetic manipulations. These studies demonstrate that age-related deficits in behavioral and neurochemical measures of feeding are likely to be mediated, in part, by the orexin system. Because these same neurotransmitter systems have been shown to underlie orexin effects on cognition, treatments which increase orexin function may have potential for improving both physiological and cognitive manifestations of certain age-related disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) play important roles in traffic of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, aberrant distributions of components of NPCs were demonstrated in C9orf72 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (C9-ALS) patients, but it is elusive whether such abnormities are also the case with other cause of ALS disease. In the present study, we investigated the spatiotemporal distributions of RanGAP1 and 4 representative nucleoporins (GP210, NUP205, NUP107 and NUP50) of NPCs in human Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-1 mutation transgenic (SOD1-Tg) mice and sporadic ALS patients. Compared with wild type (WT), these proteins displayed age-dependent and progressive nuclear precipitations, and cytoplasmic aberrant expressions in motor neurons of lumbar cord in SOD1-Tg mice from 10 to 18 weeks (W). Double immunofluorescent analysis showed abnormal nuclear retention and apparent co-localizations of RanGAPl with NUP205 and NUP205 with NUPl07, meanwhile, GP210 with NUP205 mainly co-localized in the nuclear envelope (NE) of motor neurons. Furthermore, RanGAP1, GP210 and NUP50 showed similarly abnormal nuclear precipitations and cytoplasmic upregulations in SOD1-Tg mice and ALS patients, moreover, aberrant co-localizations of RanGAP1 with TDP-43 and NUP205 with TDP-43 were also observed in motor neurons. The present study indicated that the mislocalization of these proteins of NPCs may underlie the pathogenesis of ALS both in SOD1-Tg mice and human sporadic ALS patients, and these dysfunctions may be a fundamental pathway for ALS that is not specific only in C9-ALS but also in SOD1-ALS, which may be amenable to pharmacotherapeutic intervention.

AB  - Abstract
The incidence of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is highest in people with chronic and drug-resistant epilepsy. Chronic spontaneous recurrent seizures cause cardiorespiratory autonomic dysfunctions. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is neuroprotective, whereas microglia produce both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects in the CNS. During acute seizures in rats, PACAP and microglia produce sympathoprotective effect at the intermediolateral cell column (IML), whereas their action on the presympathetic rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) neurons mediates proarrhythmogenic changes. We evaluated the effect of PACAP and microglia at the IML on sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), cardiovascular reflex responses, and electrocardiographic changes in the post-status epilepticus (SE) model of acquired epilepsy, and control rats. Chronic spontaneous seizures in rats produced tachycardia with profound proarrhythmogenic effects (prolongation of QT interval). Antagonism of microglia, but not PACAP, significantly reduced the SNA and the corrected QT interval in post-SE rats. PACAP and microglia antagonists did not change baroreflex and peripheral or central chemoreflex responses with varied effect on somatosympathetic responses in post-SE and control rats. We did not notice changes in microglial morphology or changes in a number of M2 phenotype in epileptic nor control rats in the vicinity of RVLM neurons. Our findings establish that microglial activation, and not PACAP, at the IML accounts for higher SNA and proarrhythmogenic changes during chronic epilepsy in rats. This is the first experimental evidence to support a neurotoxic effect of microglia during chronic epilepsy, in contrast to their neuroprotective action during acute seizures.

During the early developmental period, long-term potentiation (LTP) can be induced in both vertical and horizontal connections in the rat visual cortex. However, the temporal difference in LTP change between the two pathways during animal development remains unclear. In this study, LTP in vertical (from layer IV to layer II/III) and horizontal (from layer II/III to layer II/III) synaptic connections were recorded in brain slices from the same rats, and the developmental changes of LTP in both directions were compared within the animals’ eye-opening period. The results showed that the LTP amplitudes declined to unobservable levels on P16 in the horizontal connections and on P20 in the vertical synaptic connections. Meanwhile, V-LTP (LTP induced in the vertical direction) was always stronger than H-LTP (LTP induced in the horizontal direction) under the same conditions of pairing stimulus (PS). Next, H-LTP and V-LTP were induced from the same neuron in layer II/III to determine the spatiotemporal interactions between layer II/III horizontal inputs and ascending synaptic inputs during the maturation of rat visual cortex. The data show that the weak PS, which failed to induce H-LTP alone, was able to induce H-LTP effectively while V-LTP was performed on P10. Our results suggest that V-LTP can strengthen H-LTP induction in the visual cortex during the early developmental period. In contrast, the regulatory effect of H-LTP on V-LTP was much weaker.

AB  - Abstract
Apocynin (APO) is a well-known NADPH oxidase (NOX) inhibitor. However, several studies have reported its ability to increase glutathione (GSH) levels. Due to GSH is a major non-enzymatic antioxidant in brain, the aim of this study was to evaluate, in the striatum of control and quinolinic acid (QUIN) injected rats, the effect of APO administration on: (1) GSH levels, (2) activity of some enzymes involved in the GSH metabolism, and (3) nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) mRNA levels. Animals received QUIN 240 nmol in right striatum and APO (5 mg/kg, i.p.), 30 min before and 60 min after intrastriatal injection. APO treatment prevented the QUIN-induced histological damage to the striatum. In control rats, APO treatment increased GSH and Nrf2 mRNA levels and the activities of gamma-glutamylcysteine ligase (γ-GCL), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). On the other hand, APO treatment prevented the QUIN-induced decrease in GSH and Nrf2 levels, and in γ-GCL and GPx activities. These data indicate that APO is able to increase GSH levels and the activity of proteins involved in its metabolism, which could be associated with its ability to increase the Nrf2 mRNA levels.

AB  - Abstract
Human rhythmic movements spontaneously entrain to external rhythmic stimuli. Such sensory-motor entrainment can attract movements to different tempi and enhance their efficiency, with potential clinical applications for motor rehabilitation. Here we investigate whether entrainment of self-paced rhythmic movements can be induced via transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), which uses alternating currents to entrain spontaneous brain oscillations at specific frequencies. Participants swung a handheld pendulum at their preferred tempo with the right hand while tACS was applied over their left or right primary motor cortex at frequencies equal to their preferred tempo (Experiment 1) or in the alpha (10 Hz) and beta (20 Hz) ranges (Experiment 2). Given that entrainment generally occurs only if the frequency difference between two rhythms is small, stimulations were delivered at frequencies equal to participants’ preferred movement tempo (≈1 Hz) and ±12.5% in Experiment 1, and at 10 Hz and 20 Hz, and ±12.5% in Experiment 2. The comparison of participants’ movement frequency, amplitude, variability, and phase synchrony with and without tACS failed to reveal entrainment or movement modifications across the two experiments. However, significant differences in stimulation-related side effects reported by participants were found between the two experiments, with phosphenes and burning sensations principally occurring in Experiment 2, and metallic tastes reported marginally more often in Experiment 1. Although other stimulation protocols may be effective, our results suggest that rhythmic movements such as pendulum swinging or locomotion that are low in goal-directedness and/or strongly driven by peripheral and mechanical constraints may not be susceptible to modulation by tACS.

AB  - Abstract
The study explored unintentional force changes elicited by removing visual feedback during cyclical, two-finger isometric force production tasks. Subjects performed two types of tasks at 1 Hz, paced by an auditory metronome. One – Force task – required cyclical changes in total force while maintaining the sharing, defined as relative contribution of a finger to total force. The other task – Share task – required cyclical changes in sharing while keeping total force unchanged. Each trial started under full visual feedback on both force and sharing; subsequently, feedback on the variable that was instructed to stay constant was frozen, and finally feedback on the other variable was also removed. In both tasks, turning off visual feedback on total force elicited a drop in the mid-point of the force cycle and an increase in the peak-to-peak force amplitude. Turning off visual feedback on sharing led to a drift of mean share toward 50:50 across both tasks. Without visual feedback there was consistent deviation of the two force time series from the in-phase pattern (typical of the Force task) and from the out-of-phase pattern (typical of the Share task). This finding is in contrast to most earlier studies that demonstrated only two stable patterns, in-phase and out-of-phase. We interpret the results as consequences of drifts of parameters in a dynamical system leading in particular to drifts in the referent finger coordinates toward their actual coordinates. The relative phase desynchronization is caused by the right–left differences in the hypothesized drift processes, consistent with the dynamic dominance hypothesis.

AB  - Abstract
The trigeminal ganglia (TG) subserving the head and the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) subserving the rest of the body are homologous handling sensory neurons. Differences exist, as a number of signaling substances cause headache but no pain in the rest of the body. To date, very few genes involved in this difference have been identified. We aim to reveal basal gene expression levels in TG and DRG and detect genes that are differentially expressed (DE) between TG and DRG. RNA-Sequencing from six naïve rats describes the whole transcriptome expression profiles of TG and DRG. Differential expression analysis was followed by pathway analysis to identify DE processes between TG and DRG. In total, 64 genes had higher and 55 genes had lower expressed levels in TG than DRG. Higher expressed genes, including S1pr5 and Gjc2, have been related to phospholipase activity. The lower expressed genes, including several Hox genes and Slc5a7, have been related to tyrosine and phenylalanine metabolism. Tissue-specific expression was identified for Gabra6 and Gabrd in TG, and for several Hox genes in DRG. Furthermore, genes that were known to be associated with headache/migraine were mostly moderately to highly expressed in one or both tissues. We present a comprehensive overview of the expression profiles of whole tissue comparison of TG and DRG. Further, we showed DE genes/pathways between TG and DRG, including several known migraine-associated genes. This study provides a basis for further pain-related studies using TG and DRG in rats.

AB  - Abstract
The prefrontal cortex and the amygdala are critical for the emotional guidance of behavior and are believed to be a site of action for many anxiolytics and anxiogenics. Despite extensive studies examining how these drugs affect behavior, there is little information regarding their effects on neuronal activity. Additionally, with recent recognition of anxiety as a non-motor symptom of Parkinson’s disease, it is unknown if activity in the cortex and the amygdala is altered. Previously, we reported that hemiparkinsonian rats had higher baseline anxiety-like behavior and diminished responsiveness to the acute anxiolytic, diazepam. In contrast, sham-lesioned rats exhibited anxiolytic behavior to diazepam. In this study, we monitored in vivo single-unit spiking activity simultaneously from the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in anesthetized sham-lesioned and hemiparkinsonian rats to unmask neuro-circuits underpinning the difference in diazepam responsiveness. We found that baseline spiking activity in the ACC was the same in both sham and hemiparkinsonian rats. We also noted a similar phenomenon for baseline activity in the BLA between sham and hemiparkinsonian rats. However, neuronal spiking activity after diazepam administration (1.5 mg/kg, SubQ) was lower than in controls in the ACC of sham-lesioned rats whereas no difference was noted after diazepam treatment in hemiparkinsonian rats. BLA neuronal spiking activity was unaffected by diazepam administration in either animal group. On the other hand, yohimbine treatment (5 mg/kg, SubQ) coincided with lower neuronal spiking activity compared to controls in the BLA of sham-lesioned rats, but was unchanged from controls in hemiparkinsonian rats. Yohimbine did not affect ACC neuronal spiking activity in either group. Overall, the lack of ACC responsiveness to diazepam in hemiparkinsonian, but not sham-lesioned rats underscores a plausible fundamental difference in anxiety-related neural signaling between animal groups.

AB  - Abstract
Transgenic knock-in (KI) mice that express CaV2.1 channels containing an R192Q gain-of-function mutation in the α1A subunit known to cause familial hemiplegic migraine type-1 in patients, exhibit key disease characteristics and provide a useful tool to investigate pathophysiological mechanisms of pain transduction. Previously, KI trigeminal sensory neurons were shown to exhibit constitutive hyperexcitability due to up-regulation of ATP-gated P2X3 receptors that trigger spike activity at a more negative threshold. This implies that intrinsic neuronal conductances may shape action potential generation in response to ATP, which could act as a mediator of migraine headache. Here we investigated whether the hyperpolarization-activated conductance Ih, mediated by hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN), contributes to sub-threshold behavior and firing in wild-type (WT) and KI trigeminal ganglia (TG) neurons. Whereas most WT and KI trigeminal neurons expressed Ih current, blocked by the specific inhibitor ZD7288, it was smaller in KI neurons despite similar activation and deactivation kinetics. HCN1 and HCN2 were the most abundantly expressed subunits in TG, both in situ and in culture. In KI TG neurons, HCN2 subunits were predominantly present in the cytoplasm, not at the plasma membrane, likely accounting for the smaller Ih of such cells. ZD7288 hyperpolarized the membrane potential, thereby raising the firing threshold, and prolonging the spike trajectory to generate fewer spikes due to P2X3 receptor activation. The low amplitude of Ih in KI TG neurons suggests that down-regulation of Ih current in sub-threshold behavior acts as a compensatory mechanism to limit sensory hyperexcitability, manifested under certain stressful stimuli.

AB  - Abstract
Glioma, one of the most common cancers in human, is classified to different grades according to the degrees of malignancy. Glioblastoma (GBM) is known to be the most malignant (Grade IV) whereas low-grade astrocytoma (LGA, Grade II) is relatively benign. The mechanism underlying the pathogenesis and progression of glioma malignancy remains unclear. Here we report a quantitative proteomic study to elucidate the differences between GBM and LGA using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry followed by label-free quantification. A total of 136 proteins were differentially expressed in GBM for at least five folds in comparison with LGA. Ontological analysis revealed a close correlation between GBM-associated proteins and RNA processing. Interaction network analysis indicated that the GBM-associated proteins in the RNA processing were linked to crucial signaling transduction modulators including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), which were further connected to the proteins important for neuronal structural integrity, development and functions. Upregulation of 40S ribosomal protein S5 (RPS5), Ferritin Heavy chain (FTH1) and STAT1, and downregulation of tenascin R (TNR) were validated as representatives by immune assays. In summary, we revealed a panel of GBM-associated proteins and the important modulators centered at the RNA-processing network in glioma malignancy that may become novel biomarkers and help elucidate the underlying mechanism.

AB  - Abstract
Semaphorins comprise a family of proteins involved in axon guidance during development. Semaphorin4D (Sema4D) has both neuroregenerative and neurorepressive functions, being able to stimulate both axonal outgrowth and growth cone collapse during development, and therefore could play an important role in neurological recovery from traumatic injury. Here, we used a zebrafish spinal cord transection model to study the role of Sema4D in a system capable of neuroregeneration. Real-time qPCR and in situ hybridization showed upregulated Sema4D expression in the acute response phase (within 3 days post SCI), and downregulated levels in the chronic response phase (11–21 days after SCI). Double-immunostaining for Sema4D and either Islet-1 (motoneuron marker) or Iba-1 (microglial marker) showed that microglia surrounded Sema4D-positive motoneurons along the central canal at 4 h post injury (hpi) and 12 hpi. Following administration of Sema4D morpholino (MO) to transected zebrafish, double-immunostaining showed that Sema4D-positive motoneurons surrounded by microglia decreased at 7 days and 11 days compared with standard control MO. Anterograde and retrograde tracing indicate that Sema4D participates in axon regeneration in the spinal cord following spinal cord injury (SCI) in the zebrafish. Swim tracking shows that MO-mediated inhibition of Sema4D retarded the recovery of swimming function when compared to standard control MO. The combined results indicate that Sema4D expression in motoneurons enhances locomotor recovery and axon regeneration, possibly by regulating microglia function, after SCI in adult zebrafish.

AB  - Abstract
Diphtheria toxin (DT) administration into transgenic mice that express the DT receptor (DTR) under control of specific promoters is often used for cell ablation studies in vivo. Because DTR is not expressed in mice, DT injection has been assumed to be nontoxic to cells in vivo. In this study, we demonstrated that DT application during the juvenile stage leads to hearing loss in wild-type mice. Auditory brainstem response measurement showed severe hearing loss in C57BL/6 mice administered DT during the juvenile period, and the hearing loss persisted into adulthood. However, ototoxicity did not occur when DT was applied on postnatal day 28 or later. Histological studies demonstrated that hearing loss was accompanied by significant degeneration of inner and outer hair cells (HCs), as well as spiral ganglion neurons. Scanning electron microscopy showed quick degeneration of inner HCs within 3 days and gradual degeneration of outer HCs within 1 week. These results demonstrated that DT has ototoxic action on C57BL/6 mice during the juvenile period, but not thereafter, and the hearing loss was due to degeneration of inner and outer HCs by unknown DT-related mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract
Sodium-activated potassium (KNa) channels contribute to firing frequency adaptation and slow after hyperpolarization. The KCNT1 gene (also known as SLACK) encodes a KNa subunit that is expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. Missense mutations of the SLACK C-terminus have been reported in several patients with rare forms of early onset epilepsy and in some cases severely delayed myelination. To date, such mutations identified in patients with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE), epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS) and Ohtahara syndrome (OS) have been reported to be gain-of-function mutations (Villa and Combi, 2016). An exome sequencing study identified a p.Phe932Ile KCNT1 mutation as the disease-causing change in a child with severe early infantile epileptic encephalopathy and abnormal myelination (Vanderver et al., 2014). We characterized an analogous mutation in the rat Slack channel and unexpectedly found this mutation to produce a loss-of-function phenotype. In an effort to restore current, we tested the known Slack channel opener loxapine. Loxapine exhibited no effect, indicating that this mutation either caused the channel to be insensitive to this established opener or proper translation and trafficking to the membrane was disrupted. Protein analysis confirmed that while total mutant protein did not differ from wild type, membrane expression of the mutant channel was substantially reduced. Although gain-of-function mutations to the Slack channel are linked to epileptic phenotypes, this is the first reported loss-of-function mutation linked to severe epilepsy and delayed myelination.

AB  - Abstract
The stimuli that commonly activate the catecholaminergic C1 neurons (nociception, hypotension, and hypoxia) also increase breathing. Pharmacogenetic evidence suggests that catecholaminergic neurons regulate breathing. Therefore, we evaluated whether the loss of C1 cells affects cardiorespiratory control during resting, hypoxic (8% O2) and hypercapnic (7% CO2) conditions. A bilateral injection of the immunotoxin anti-dopamine β-hydroxylase-saporin (anti-DβH-SAP; 2.4 ng/100 nl) or saline was performed in adult male Wistar rats (270–300 g, N = 5–8/group). Histology revealed a 60–75% loss of C1 neurons in anti-DβH-SAP-treated rats, but no significant changes or C1 cell loss was observed in sham-treated rats or those with off-target injection sites. Bilateral depletion of C1 neurons did not alter cardiorespiratory variables during rest and hypercapnia (7% CO2), but it did affect the response to hypoxia. Specifically, the increase in ventilation, the number of sighs, and the tachycardia were reduced, but unexpectedly, the mean arterial pressure increased during hypoxia (8% O2). The present study indicates that C1 neurons contribute to cardiorespiratory control during hypoxia rather than at rest or during hypercapnia.

AB  - Abstract
Exposure to acute stress leads to diverse changes, which include either beneficial or deleterious effects on molecular levels that are implicated in stress-related disorders. N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated signalings, are thought to be vital players in stress-related mental disorders as well as attractive therapeutic targets for clinical treatment. In the present study, we utilized acute stress models in mice to explore regulation of phosphorylation level of S1284 in GluN2B subunit of NMDAR. We found out that forced swimming and acute restraint stress increased phosphorylation level of S1284, while phosphorylation level of S1284 was unaltered after brief exposure to open field. Moreover, phosphorylation change of S1284 was negated by treatment of roscovitine which is believed to be a Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. Besides, we showed well correlation of phosphorylation change of S1284 and immobility time during forced swimming. Collectively, our results demonstrated that phosphorylation level of S1284 in GluN2B was regulated by acute stress.

AB  - Abstract
Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and plays an important role in regulating neuronal excitability. GABA reuptake from the synapse is dependent on specific transporters – mainly GAT-1, GAT-3 and BGT-1 (GATs). This study is the first to show alterations in the expression of the GATs in the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and superior temporal gyrus. We found a significant increase in BGT-1 expression associated with AD in all layers of the dentate gyrus, in the stratum oriens of the CA2 and CA3 and the superior temporal gyrus. In AD there was a significant decrease in GAT-1 expression in the entorhinal cortex and superior temporal gyrus. We also found a significant decrease in GAT-3 immunoreactivity in the stratum pyramidale of the CA1 and CA3, the subiculum and entorhinal cortex. These observations indicate that the expression of the GATs shows brain-region- and layer-specific alterations in AD, suggesting a complex activation pattern of different GATs during the course of the disease.

AB  - Abstract
Thrombin, an essential component in the coagulation cascade, participates in the pathogenesis of brain diseases, such as ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease through blood–brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. It is thought that the thrombin-matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 axis is an important process in the pathogenesis of neurovascular disease, such as BBB dysfunction. We recently reported that brain pericytes are the most MMP-9-releasing cells in response to thrombin stimulation among the BBB-constituting cells. This thrombin-induced MMP-9 release is partially due to protease-activated receptor (PAR1), one of the specific thrombin receptors. Then, we evaluated the intracellular signaling pathways involved in MMP-9 release and the contribution of thrombin-reactive brain pericytes to BBB dysfunction. PKC activator evoked MMP-9 release from brain pericytes. The thrombin-induced MMP-9 release was inhibited by U0126, LY294002, Go6976, and Go6983. However, Go6976 decreased phosphorylation levels of PKCθ and Akt, and Go6983 decreased phosphorylation levels of PKCδ and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Additionally, treatment of pericytes with thrombin or PAR1-activating peptide stimulated PKCδ/θ signaling. These substances impaired brain endothelial barrier function in the presence of brain pericytes. Brain pericytes function through two independent downstream signaling pathways via PAR1 activation to release MMP-9 in response to thrombin – the PKCθ-Akt pathway and the PKCδ-ERK1/2 pathway. These pathways participate in PAR1-mediated MMP-9 release from pericytes, which leads to BBB dysfunction. Brain pericytes and their specific signaling pathways could provide novel therapeutic targets for thrombin-induced neurovascular diseases.

AB  - Abstract
The neural extracellular matrix (ECM) plays an important role in regulation of perisomatic GABAergic inhibition and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and cortex. Decreased labeling of perineuronal nets, a form of ECM predominantly associated with parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in the brain, has been observed in post-mortem studies of schizophrenia patients, specifically, in brain areas such as prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, and amygdala. Moreover, glial ECM in the form of dandelion clock-like structures was reported to be altered in schizophrenia patients. Here, we verified whether similar abnormalities in neural ECM can be reproduced in a rat model of schizophrenia, in which animals received sub-chronic administration of ketamine to reproduce the aspects of disease related to disrupted signaling through N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Our study focused on two schizophrenia-related brain areas, namely the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus. Semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate investigate ECM expression using Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) and CS56 antibody, both labeling distinct chondroitin sulfate epitopes enriched in perineuronal nets and glial ECM, respectively. Our analysis revealed that ketamine-treated rats exhibit reduced number of WFA-labeled perineuronal nets, and a decreased intensity of parvalbumin fluorescence in mPFC interneurons somata. Moreover, we found an increased expression of CS56 immunoreactive form of ECM. Importantly, the loss of perineuronal nets was revealed in the mPFC, and was not detected in the hippocampus, suggesting regional specificity of ECM alterations. These data open an avenue for further investigations of functional importance of ECM abnormalities in schizophrenia as well as for search of treatments for their compensation.

AB  - Abstract
Men and women manifest different symptoms of depression and under current diagnostic criteria, depression is twice as prevalent in woman. However, little is known of the mechanisms contributing to these important sex differences. Sub-chronic variable stress (SCVS), a rodent model of depression, induces depression-like behaviors in female mice only, modeling clinical evidence of higher susceptibility to mood disorders in women. Accumulating evidence indicates that altered neuroplasticity of excitatory synapses in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key pathophysiological feature of susceptibility to social stress in males. Here we investigated the effects of SCVS on pre- and post-synaptic protein levels and morphology of glutamatergic synapses of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAc of female and male mice. Animals underwent six-day exposure to alternating stressors including shock, tail suspension and restraint. MSNs from the NAc were filled with a Lucifer yellow dye and spine density and type were examined using NeuronStudio. In a separate group of animals, immunofluorescence staining was performed for vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) and vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), in order to label cortical and subcortical glutamatergic terminals. Immunostaining for post-synaptic density 95 (PSD95) was employed to evaluate post-synaptic density. Females demonstrated circuit-specific pre-synaptic alterations in VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 containing synapses that may contribute to stress susceptibility in the absence of post-synaptic alterations in PSD95 puncta, spine density or type. These data indicate that susceptibility to stress in females is associated with changes in the frequency of distinct glutamatergic inputs to the NAc.

AB  - Abstract
The prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala and hippocampus display a coordinated activity during acquisition of associative fear memories. Evidence indicates that PFC engagement in aversive memory formation does not progress linearly as previously thought. Instead, it seems to be recruited at specific time windows after memory acquisition, which has implications for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorders. Cannabidiol (CBD), the major non-psychotomimetic phytocannabinoid of the Cannabis sativa plant, is known to modulate contextual fear memory acquisition in rodents. However, it is still not clear how CBD interferes with PFC-dependent processes during post-training memory consolidation. Here, we tested whether intra-PFC infusions of CBD immediately after or 5 h following contextual fear conditioning was able to interfere with memory consolidation. Neurochemical and cellular correlates of the CBD treatment were evaluated by the quantification of extracellular levels of dopamine (DA), serotonin, and their metabolites in the PFC and by measuring the cellular expression of activity-dependent transcription factors in cortical and limbic regions. Our results indicate that bilateral intra-PFC CBD infusion impaired contextual fear memory consolidation when applied 5 h after conditioning, but had no effect when applied immediately after it. This effect was associated with a reduction in DA turnover in the PFC following retrieval 5 days after training. We also observed that post-conditioning infusion of CBD reduced c-fos and zif-268 protein expression in the hippocampus, PFC, and thalamus. Our findings support that CBD interferes with contextual fear memory consolidation by reducing PFC influence on cortico-limbic circuits.

AB  - Abstract
Osteopontin (OPN), an extracellular matrix (ECM) glyco-phosphoprotein, plays an important role in autoimmune-mediated demyelinating diseases, including multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). As an integrin and CD44 binding protein it participates in bidirectional communication between the ECM and target cells and affects transduction pathways that maintain neuronal and immune cell homeostasis. Its biological activity is also heavily influenced by microenvironment, which stimulates the cleavage of OPN and changes its functions.

In this study we estimated the expression profile of OPN in neural tissues of DA rats during the first relapse of chronic relapsing EAE and investigated the relationship of OPN to metallothionein I + II (MTs), which play pivotal role in zinc-related cell homeostasis and in protection of CNS against cytokine-induced injury. The data showed that in EAE rats OPN mRNA and protein levels increased concurrently with the transcription of MTs and that within the spinal cord (SC) lysates EAE-afflicted rats had a higher content of OPN fragments of low molecular weight than untreated and CFA-treated rats. The expression of OPN and MTs was upregulated on ependymal, lymphoid and astroglial cells and on multiple αvβ3+ neurons in SC and in the brain (cortex, white matter, hippocampus, and cerebellum). Besides, multiple cells co-expressed OPN and MTs. Granular OPN signals were detected in secretory vesicles of Golgy (αvβ3 neurons) and in patches adjacent to the plasma membrane (subventricular zone).

The findings imply that in demyelinating lesions are generated proteolytic OPN fragments and that OPN/MT interactions contribute to tissue remodeling during an autoimmune attack.

AB  - Abstract
Acute stress impairs the hippocampus-dependent spatial memory retrieval, and its synaptic mechanisms are associated with hippocampal CA1 long-term depression (LTD) enhancement in the adult rats. Endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is recognized as a novel gasotransmitter and has the neural protective roles. However, very little attention has been paid to understanding the effects of H2S on spatial memory retrieval impairment. We observed the protective effects of NaHS (a donor of H2S) against spatial memory retrieval impairment caused by acute stress and its synaptic mechanisms. Our results showed that NaHS abolished spatial memory retrieval impairment and hippocampal CA1 LTD enhancement caused by acute stress, but not by glutamate transporter inhibitor l-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic (tPDC), indicating that the activation of glutamate transporters is necessary for exogenous H2S to exert its roles. Moreover, NaHS restored the decreased glutamate uptake in the hippocampal CA1 synaptosomal fraction caused by acute stress. Dithiothreitol (DTT, a disulfide reducing agent) abolished a decrease in the glutamate uptake caused by acute stress, and NaHS eradicated the decreased glutamate uptake caused by 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic)acid (DTNB, a thiol oxidizing agent), collectively, revealing that exogenous H2S increases glutamate uptake by reducing disulfide bonds of the glutamate transporters. Additionally, NaHS inhibited the increased expression level of phosphorylated c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) in the hippocampal CA1 region caused by acute stress. The JNK inhibitor SP600125 eliminated spatial memory retrieval impairment, hippocampal CA1 LTD enhancement and the decreased glutamate uptake caused by acute stress, indicating that exogenous H2S exerts these roles by inhibiting the activation of JNK signaling pathway.

AB  - Abstract
Previous research suggests that interlimb differences in coordination associated with handedness might result from specialized control mechanisms that are subserved by different cerebral hemispheres. Based largely on the results of horizontal plane reaching studies, we have proposed that the hemisphere contralateral to the dominant arm is specialized for predictive control of limb dynamics, while the non-dominant hemisphere is specialized for controlling limb impedance. The current study explores interlimb differences in control of 3-D unsupported reaching movements. While the task was presented in the horizontal plane, participant’s arms were unsupported and free to move within a range of the vertical axis, which was redundant to the task plane. Results indicated significant dominant arm advantages for both initial direction accuracy and final position accuracy. The dominant arm showed greater excursion along a redundant axis that was perpendicular to the task, and parallel to gravitational forces. In contrast, the non-dominant arm better impeded motion out of the task-plane. Nevertheless, non-dominant arm task errors varied substantially more with shoulder rotation excursion than did dominant arm task errors. These findings suggest that the dominant arm controller was able to take advantage of the redundant degrees of freedom of the task, while non-dominant task errors appeared enslaved to motion along the redundant axis. These findings are consistent with a dominant controller that is specialized for intersegmental coordination, and a non-dominant controller that is specialized for impedance control. However, the findings are inconsistent with previously documented conclusions from planar tasks, in which non-dominant control leads to greater final position accuracy.

AB  - Abstract
Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) activation in the infralimbic cortex (IL) induces pronociceptive behavior in healthy and monoarthritic rats. Here we studied whether the medullary dorsal reticular nucleus (DRt) and the spinal TRPV1 are mediating the IL/mGluR5-induced spinal pronociception and whether the facilitation of pain behavior is correlated with changes in spinal dorsal horn neuron activity. For drug administrations, all animals had a cannula in the IL as well as a cannula in the DRt or an intrathecal catheter. Heat-evoked paw withdrawal was used to assess pain behavior in awake animals. Spontaneous and heat-evoked discharge rates of single DRt neurons or spinal dorsal horn wide-dynamic range (WDR) and nociceptive-specific (NS) neurons were evaluated in lightly anesthetized animals.

Activation of the IL/mGluR5 facilitated nociceptive behavior in both healthy and monoarthritic animals, and this effect was blocked by lidocaine or GABA receptor agonists in the DRt. IL/mGluR5 activation increased spontaneous and heat–evoked DRt discharge rates in healthy but not monoarthritic rats. In the spinal dorsal horn, IL/mGluR5 activation increased spontaneous activity of WDR neurons in healthy animals only, whereas heat-evoked responses of WDR and NS neurons were increased in both experimental groups. Intrathecally administered TRPV1 antagonist prevented the IL/mGluR5-induced pronociception in both healthy and monoarthritic rats.

The results suggest that the DRt is involved in relaying the IL/mGluR5-induced spinal pronociception in healthy control but not monoarthritic animals. Spinally, the IL/mGluR5-induced behavioral heat hyperalgesia is mediated by TRPV1 and associated with facilitated heat-evoked responses of WDR and NS neurons.

Morphine actions involve the dopamine (DA) D1 and D3 receptor systems (D1R and D3R), and the responses to morphine change with age. We here explored in differently aged wild-type (WT) and D3R knockout mice (D3KO) the interactions of the D1R/D3R systems with morphine in vivo at three different times of the animals’ lifespan (2 months, 1 year, and 2 years). We found that: (1) thermal pain withdrawal reflexes follow an aging-associated phenotype, with relatively longer latencies at 2 months and shorter latencies at 1 year, (2) over the same age range, a dysfunction of the D3R subtype decreases reflex latencies more than aging alone, (3) morphine altered reflex responses in a dose-dependent manner in WT animals and changed at its higher dose the phenotype of the D3KO animals from a morphine-resistant state to a morphine-responsive state, (4) block of D1R function had an aging-dependent effect on thermal withdrawal latencies in control animals that, in old animals, was stronger than that of low-dose morphine. Lastly, (5) block of D1R function in young D3KO animals mimicked the behavioral phenotype observed in the aged WT. Our proof-of-concept data from the rodent animal model suggest that, with age, block of D1R function may be considered as an alternative to the use of morphine, to modulate the response to painful stimuli.

AB  - Abstract
Awareness generation and modulation may depend on a balanced information integration and differentiation across default mode network (DMN) and external awareness networks (EAN). Neuromodulation approaches, capable of shaping information processing, may highlight residual network activities supporting awareness, which are not detectable through active paradigms, thus allowing to differentiate chronic disorders of consciousness (DoC). We studied aftereffects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) by applying graph theory within canonical frequency bands to compare the markers of these networks in the electroencephalographic data from 20 patients with DoC. We found that patients’ high-frequency networks suffered from a large-scale connectivity breakdown, paralleled by a local hyperconnectivity, whereas low-frequency networks showed a preserved but dysfunctional large-scale connectivity. There was a correlation between metrics and the behavioral awareness. Interestingly, two persons with UWS showed a residual rTMS-induced modulation of the functional correlations between the DMN and the EAN, as observed in patients with MCS. Hence, we may hypothesize that the patients with UWS who demonstrate evidence of residual DMN–EAN functional correlation may be misdiagnosed, given that such residual network correlations could support covert consciousness.

AB  - Abstract
Pain is processed in a large neural network that partially overlaps structures involved in emotion processing. Despite the fact that pain and emotion are known to share neural regions and interact in numerous clinical conditions, relatively little is known about the interaction of pain and emotion at the neural level. This study on healthy adults aimed to investigate the interaction between negative and positive emotional stimuli and experimental pain in an essential pain processing network.

Sixteen healthy young adult subjects were exposed to pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) with negative, neutral or positive valence, along with laser pain stimuli. The stimuli were pseudo-randomly arranged in three 15-min experiment series comprising 49 stimuli each (picture, laser or simultaneous picture and laser stimuli). The whole-brain blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal was acquired using 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

As expected, the pain stimulus elicited activation in the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) when compared to the baseline. The interaction of negative emotion and laser stimuli related to the activation of the left SII. The interaction of positive emotion and pain stimuli led to bilateral activation of the SII and left insula.

These findings reveal interaction in parts of the pain processing network during simultaneous emotion and physical pain. We demonstrated a valence-independent interaction of emotion and pain in SII.

AB  - Abstract
The aim of the present study was to determine whether thoracic spinal manipulation (SM) decreases temporal summation of back pain. The study comprised two controlled experiments including 16 and 15 healthy participants, respectively. Each study included six sessions during which painful or non-painful electrical stimulations were delivered in three conditions: (1) control (2) light mechanical stimulus (MS) or (3) SM. Electrical stimulation was applied on the thoracic spine (T4), in the area where SM and MS were performed. In Experiment 1, electrical stimulation consisted in a single 1-ms pulse while a single or repeated train of ten 1-ms pulses was used in Experiment 2. SM involved articular cavitation while MS was a calibrated force of 25 N applied manually for 2 s. For the single pulse, changes in pain or tactile sensation in the SM or MS sessions compared with the CTL session were not significantly different (all p’s &gt; 0.05). In contrast, temporal summation of pain was decreased in the SM session compared with the CTL session for both the single and repeated train (p’s &lt; 0.05). Changes were not significant for the MS sessions (all p’s &gt; 0.05) and no effect was observed for the tactile sensation (all p’s &gt; 0.1). These results indicate that SM produces specific inhibitory effects on temporal summation of back pain, consistent with the involvement of a spinal anti-nociceptive mechanism in clinical pain relief by SM. This provides the first mechanistic evidence of back pain relief by spinal manipulation.

AB  - Abstract
Neuroinflammation is known to play a key role in the prognosis of functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI). The involvement of microglial and mast cells in early and late stages of inflammation has been receiving increasing attention. This study was aimed at determining the influence of a pro-inflammatory cytokine, the granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), on microglia and mast cell activation, glial scar formation and functional recovery following SCI. Rats were randomly injected with saline or GM-CSF one hour after a C4–C5 medio-lateral hemisection. To assess functional impairment and recovery, the rats were subjected to sensorimotor tasks for one month. Then, responses evoked by forepaw stimulation in the primary somatosensory cortex were recorded. We also quantified the changes in GM-CSF, IL-1β, IL-6 and BDNF levels, the gliosis and lesion volume as well as microglial and mast cell density, and mast cell surface. Our findings show that GM-CSF promotes cortical reactivation and recovery of tactile abilities, whereas it does not influence motor performances. A transient decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines after GM-CSF treatment was also observed, whereas the endogenous GM-CSF level was unchanged. While the beneficial role of GM-CSF in reducing glial scar is confirmed, our findings reveal that neuroinflammatory events mediated by microglial and mast cells as well as the alteration of IL-1β and IL-6 levels are paralleled with an improvement in tactile recovery. These mechanisms could limit the duration and intensity of homeostatic imbalance and promote the plasticity of spared tissues.

AB  - Abstract
The sympato-adrenal-system and hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis are anatomically and functionally connected with participation of several brain areas that express estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ). We assessed the neuronal activity of these areas for FOS expression and the action of PPT (ERα agonist) or DPN (ERβ agonist) in HPA axis activity during hemorrhagic stress. Ovariectomized Wistar rats treated with vehicle (DMSO) or ER agonists were catheterized for blood collection. Animals received (control) or not (hemorrhagic) immediate reposition with the same volume of saline. Immunohistochemistry was performed for FOS, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) in the brain areas. In vehicle-treated animals, hemorrhage enhanced: plasma corticosterone (CORT), oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (AVP) measured by radioimmunoassay; the expression of TH-FOS co-localized neurons in ventrolateral medulla (A1C1) and FOS expression in medial parvocellular paraventricular nucleus (mpPVN). In controls, PPT decreased: plasma CORT; FOS expression at locus coeruleus (LC); FOS and CRH-FOS at mpPVN, compared to vehicle. After hemorrhage, PPT decreased: plasma CORT; FOS expression at LC and mpPVN; TH-FOS at LC, solitary tract nucleus (NTS), A1C1; CRH-FOS at mpPVN, compared to vehicle. After hemorrhage DPN decreased: plasma CORT; FOS expression at LC and mpPVN; TH-FOS at LC, A1C1; CRH-FOS at mpPVN, compared to vehicle. PPT blocked the increase of OT secretion and increased AVP secretion, after hemorrhage. DPN reduced OT and increased AVP levels, regardless hemorrhage. In hemorrhagic stress, ERα and ERβ reduced the HPA axis activation and neuronal activity in brain areas involved in the HPA axis control.

AB  - Abstract
Midbrain dopamine neurons play critical roles in reward- and aversion-driven associative learning. However, it is not clear whether they do this by a common mechanism or by separate mechanisms that can be dissociated. In the present study we addressed this question by testing whether a partial lesion of the dopamine neurons of the rat SNc has comparable effects on conditioned place preference (CPP) learning and conditioned place aversion (CPA) learning. Partial lesions of dopamine neurons in the rat substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) induced by bilateral intranigral infusion of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA, 3 μg/side) or 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP, 200 μg/side) impaired learning of conditioned place aversion (CPA) without affecting conditioned place preference (CPP) learning. Control experiments demonstrated that these lesions did not impair motor performance and did not alter the hedonic value of the sucrose and quinine. The number of dopamine neurons in the caudal part of the SNc positively correlated with the CPP scores of the 6-OHDA rats and negatively correlated with CPA scores of the SHAM rats. In addition, the CPA scores of the 6-OHDA rats positively correlated with the tissue content of striatal dopamine. Insomuch as reward-driven learning depends on an increase in dopamine release by nigral neurons, these findings show that this mechanism is functional even in rats with a partial lesion of the SNc. On the other hand, if aversion-driven learning depends on a reduction of extracellular dopamine in the striatum, the present study suggests that this mechanism is no longer functional after the partial SNc lesion.

AB  - Abstract
Several phosphorylation signaling pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis of epilepsy arising from both genetic causes and acquired insults to the brain. Identification of dysfunctional signaling pathways in epilepsy may provide novel targets for antiepileptic therapies. We previously described a deficit in phosphorylation signaling mediated by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) that occurs in an animal model of temporal lobe epilepsy, and that produces neuronal hyperexcitability measured in vitro. We asked whether in vivo pharmacological manipulation of p38 MAPK activity would influence seizure frequency in chronically epileptic animals. Administration of a p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, markedly worsened spontaneous seizure frequency, consistent with prior in vitro results. However, anisomycin, a non-specific p38 MAPK activator, significantly increased seizure frequency. We hypothesized that this unexpected result was due to activation of a related MAPK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Administration of JNK inhibitor SP600125 significantly decreased seizure frequency in a dose-dependent manner without causing overt behavioral abnormalities. Biochemical analysis showed increased JNK expression and activity in untreated epileptic animals. These results show for the first time that JNK is hyperactivated in an animal model of epilepsy, and that phosphorylation signaling mediated by JNK may represent a novel antiepileptic target.

AB  - Abstract
Human standing balance control requires the integration of sensory feedback to produce anticipatory, stabilizing ankle torques. However, the ability of human triceps surae muscle spindles to provide reliable sensory feedback regarding the small, slow ankle movements that occur during upright standing has recently come under question. We performed microneurography to directly record axon potentials from single muscle spindle afferents in the human triceps surae during servo-controlled movement of the ankle joint. To simulate movements of the ankle while standing, we delivered random 90-s dorsiflexion/plantar flexion oscillations of the ankle joint, with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.7° and frequency content below 0.5 Hz. In roughly half of the trials (46%), participants held a low-level, near-isometric contraction of the triceps surae muscles. We demonstrate that afferent activity in a population of muscle spindles closely reflects ankle movements at frequencies and amplitudes characteristic of human standing. Four out of five soleus spindles, and three out of seven gastrocnemius spindles coded for at least a single frequency component of anteroposterior ankle rotation. Concatenating within muscles, coherence was significantly greater for soleus spindles at all stimulus frequencies. Voluntary contraction of the parent muscle reduced spindle sensitivity, but only significantly near the mean power frequency of the stimulus (∼0.3 Hz). In conclusion, these results provide direct evidence that triceps surae muscle spindles are potentially capable of providing important sensory feedback for the control of human standing balance.

AB  - Abstract
Altered corneal reflex activity is a common feature of dry eye disease (DE). Trigeminal sensory nerves supply the ocular surface and terminate at the trigeminal interpolaris/caudalis (ViVc) transition and spinomedullary (VcC1) regions. Although both regions contribute to corneal reflexes, their role under dry eye conditions is not well defined. This study assessed the influence of local inhibitory and excitatory amino acid neurotransmission at the ViVc transition and VcC1 regions on hypertonic saline (HS) evoked orbicularis oculi muscle activity (OOemg) in urethane-anesthetized male rats after exorbital gland removal (DE). HS increased the magnitude of long-duration OOemg activity (OOemgL, &gt;200 ms) in DE compared to sham rats, while short-duration OOemg activity (OOemgS, &lt;200 ms) was similar for both groups. Inhibition of the ViVc transition by muscimol, a GABAA receptor agonist, greatly reduced HS-evoked OOemgL activity in DE rats, whereas injections at the VcC1 region had only minor effects in both groups. Blockade of GABAA receptors by bicuculline methiodide at the ViVc transition or VcC1 region increased HS-evoked OOemgL activity in DE rats. Blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors at either region reduced HS-evoked OOemgL activity in DE and sham rats. GABAαβ3 receptor density was reduced at the ViVc transition, while NMDA receptor density was increased at both regions in DE rats. Loss of GABAergic inhibition at the ViVc transition coupled with enhanced NMDA excitatory amino acid neurotransmission at the ViVc transition and the VcC1 region likely contribute to altered corneal reflexes under dry eye conditions.

AB  - Abstract
Detection of awareness in patients with consciousness disorders is a challenge that can be facilitated by functional neuroimaging. We elaborated a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) protocol to detect covert activity in altered states of consciousness. We hypothesized that passive listening to narratives with graduated emotional charge triggers graduated cerebral activations. The fMRI protocol was designed in healthy subjects for further clinical applications. The emotional charge was graduated using voice familiarity and long-term declarative memory content: low emotional charge, unknown person telling general semantic memory; mean emotional charge, relative telling the same narratives; high emotional charge, same relative telling autobiographical memory. Autobiographical memory was subdivided into semantic autobiographical memory and episodic autobiographical memory. The protocol proved efficient at triggering graduated cerebral activations: low emotional charge, superior temporal gyri and sulci; mean emotional charge, same as low emotional charge plus bilateral premotor cortices and left inferior frontal gyrus; high emotional charge, cingulate, temporal, frontal, prefrontal and angular areas, thalamus and cerebellum. Semantic autobiographical memory revealed larger activations than episodic autobiographical memory. Independent ROI analysis confirmed the preponderant contribution of narratives with autobiographical memory content in triggering cerebral activation, not only in autobiographical memory-sensitive areas, but also in voice-sensitive, language-sensitive and semantic memory-sensitive areas.

The whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used to record current responses to AMPA, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), muscimol and dibenzoyl-ATP (Bz-ATP) in superficial (reactive/gliotic) substantia gelatinosa (SG) astrocytes and neurons of spinal cord slices kept for different periods of time in organotypic culture. Currents induced by AMPA, NMDA and muscimol confirmed the existence of their specific receptors in 2-week-old neurons; astrocytes cultured for the same period of time responded to AMPA and muscimol, but not to NMDA. AMPA had a larger effect on 2-week-old astrocytes than on the 1-week-old ones, in spite of a similar sensitivity of the age-matched neurons to this amino acid. The effect of the prototypic P2X7 receptor agonist Bz-ATP on superficial astrocytes and neurons depended on the drug concentration applied and increased in parallel with the lengthening of the culture period. The amplitudes of Bz-ATP currents of deep (resting) astrocytes were age-independent. Neurons located in deep layers exhibited after 1 week of culturing much larger Bz-ATP currents than the superficial ones of the same age. In conclusion, whereas resting astrocytes had culture period-independent P2X7 receptor-sensitivity, reactive/gliotic astrocytes exhibited P2X7 receptor-sensitivity increasing in parallel with the prolongation of the time spent in culture. The results with Bz-ATP agree with the facilitation of AMPA-induced currents in reactive astrocytes during development, and with the hypothesis that extracellular ATP is an ontogenetically early transmitter/signaling molecule in the CNS.

AB  - Abstract
A seizure is a sustained increase in brain electrical activity that can result in loss of consciousness and injury. Understanding how the brain responds to seizures is important for development of new treatment strategies for epilepsy, a neurological condition characterized by recurrent and unprovoked seizures. Pharmacological induction of seizures in rodent models results in a myriad of cellular alterations, including inflammation, angiogenesis, and adult neurogenesis. The purpose of this study is to investigate the cellular responses to recurrent pentylenetetrazole seizures in the adult zebrafish brain. We subjected zebrafish to five once-daily pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures and characterized the cellular consequences of these seizures. In response to recurrent seizures, we found histologic evidence of vasodilatation, perivascular leukocyte egress and leukocyte proliferation suggesting seizure-induced acute CNS inflammation. We also found evidence of increased proliferation, neurogenesis, and reactive gliosis following pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures. Collectively, our results suggest that the cellular responses to seizures in the adult zebrafish brain are similar to those observed in mammalian brains.

AB  - Abstract
Spontaneous epileptiform activity has previously been observed in lateral amygdala (LA) slices derived from patients with intractable-temporal lobe epilepsy. The present study aimed to characterize intranuclear LA synaptic connectivity and to test the hypothesis that differences in the spread of flow of neuronal activity may relate to spontaneous epileptiform activity occurrence.

Electrical activity was evoked through electrical microstimulation in acute human brain slices containing the LA, signals were recorded as local field potentials combined with fast optical imaging of voltage-sensitive dye fluorescence. Sites of stimulation and recording were systematically varied. Following recordings, slices were anatomically reconstructed using two-dimensional unitary slices as a reference for coronal and parasagittal planes. Local spatial patterns and spread of activity were assessed by incorporating the coordinates of electrical and optical recording sites into the respective unitary slice.

A preferential directional spread of evoked electrical signals was observed from ventral to dorsal, rostral to caudal and medial to lateral regions in the LA. No differences in spread of evoked activity were observed between spontaneously and non-spontaneously active LA slices, i.e. basic properties of evoked synaptic responses were similar in the two functional types of LA slices, including input–output relationship, and paired-pulse depression.

These results indicate a directed propagation of synaptic signals within the human LA in spontaneously active epileptic slices. We suggest that the lack of differences in local and in systemic information processing has to be found in confined epileptiform circuits within the amygdala likely involving well-known “epileptic neurons”.

AB  - Abstract
This study investigated the mechanisms underlying regulation of the serotonin system in the rat brain during exercise-induced chronic fatigue. High-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) was performed to measure serum tryptophan of the fatigued rat. HPLC was conducted to measure 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. In addition, 5-HT1A receptor and 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) mRNA expressions were measured at the same locations using real-time PCR. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in the serum tryptophan level in rats with exercise-induced chronic fatigue. Moreover, increased 5-HT and decreased 5-HIAA levels were detected in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, and these alterations were significant. Further, 5-HTT expression was significantly increased and 5-HT1A receptor expression was significantly decreased. These results indicate that the 5-HT system plays an important role in the development of exercise-induced chronic fatigue. The 5-HT levels in different parts of the brain increased simultaneously, especially at synapses, and these alterations were associated with changes in 5-HTT and 5-HT1A mRNA expressions.

AB  - Abstract
In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is the site of the main circadian clock, synchronized by the light–dark cycle, which generates behavioral rhythms like feeding, drinking and activity. Notwithstanding, the main role of the SCN clock on the control of all circadian rhythms has been questioned due to the presence of clock activity in many brain areas, including those implicated in the regulation of feeding and reward. Moreover, whether circadian rhythms of particular motivated behaviors exist is unknown. Here, we evaluated the spontaneous daily and circadian behavior of consumption of a sweet caloric solution (5–10% sucrose), and the effects of sucrose intake on the expression of clock genes in the mouse brain. Mice showed a daily (in a light–dark cycle) and a circadian (in constant darkness conditions) rhythm in the intake and sucrose preference with a rise for both parameters at night (or subjective night). In addition, we observed changes in the circadian day-night expression of the clock gene Per2 in the SCN, cortex and striatum of animals ingesting sucrose compared to control mice on pure water. Finally, daily rhythms of sucrose intake and preference were abolished in Per2Brdm1- and double Per1−/− Per2Brdm1-mutant animals. These data indicate that the expression of circadian rhythms of hedonic feeding behaviors may be controlled by brain circadian clocks and Per gene expression.

AB  - Abstract
Excessive activation of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signaling within the spinal dorsal horn contributes to central sensitization and the induction and maintenance of pathological pain states. However, direct antagonism of NMDARs produces undesirable side effects which limit their clinical use. NMDAR activation produces central sensitization, in part, by initiating a signaling cascade that activates the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and generates the signaling molecule nitric oxide. NMDAR-mediated activation of nNOS requires a scaffolding protein, postsynaptic density protein 95 kDa (PSD95), which tethers nNOS to NMDARs. Thus, disrupting the protein–protein interaction between PSD95 and nNOS may inhibit pro-nociceptive signaling mechanisms downstream of NMDARs and suppress central sensitization while sparing unwanted side effects associated with NMDAR antagonists. We examined the impact of small molecule PSD95–nNOS protein–protein interaction inhibitors (ZL006, IC87201) on both nociceptive behavior and formalin-evoked Fos protein expression within the lumbar spinal cord of rats. Comparisons were made with ZL007, an inactive analog of ZL006, and the NMDAR antagonist MK-801. IC87201 and ZL006, but not ZL007, suppressed phase 2 of formalin-evoked pain behavior and decreased the number of formalin-induced Fos-like immunoreactive cells in spinal dorsal horn regions associated with nociceptive processing. MK-801 suppressed Fos protein expression in both dorsal and ventral horns. MK-801 produced motor ataxia in the rotarod test whereas IC87201 and ZL006 failed to do so. ZL006 but not ZL007 suppressed paclitaxel-induced mechanical and cold allodynia in a model of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed the presence of the PSD95–nNOS complex in lumbar spinal cord of paclitaxel-treated rats, although ZL006 did not reliably disrupt the complex in all subjects. The present findings validate use of putative small molecule PSD95–nNOS protein–protein interaction inhibitors as novel analgesics and demonstrate, for the first time, that these inhibitors suppress inflammation-evoked neuronal activation at the level of the spinal dorsal horn.

AB  - Abstract
Glycosyltransferases are enzymes that catalyze the formation of a variety of glycoconjugates. Glycoconjugates play important roles in the nervous system. β-1,3-Galactosyltransferase 2 (B3galt2) belongs to the family of β-1,3-galactosyltransferase, which is one of the major types of glycosyltransferases. Dental pulp inflammation may cause neurophysiological alterations in the trigeminal ganglion (TG), and serve as a good model for investigating the peripheral inflammation and trigeminal neuronal sensitization. In the present study, we investigated the expression of B3galt2 in neuroinflammation using the dental pulp inflammatory model induced by lipopolysaccharide in rat. The expression of B3galt2 gene and protein were determined by reverse transcription PCR, immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. ELISA assays were used to measure the levels of cytokines in the TG neurons. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Our results demonstrated that B3galt2 was expressed in the TG, and dental pulp inflammation up-regulated B3galt2 expression in the TG. B3galt2 gene knockdown reduced the secretion of TNFα and IL-6 in the TG neurons. The expression of TLR4 and NFκB in the TG was activated during the inflammation, but B3galt2 gene knockdown inhibited the expression of TLR4 and NFκB. These observations indicated that dental pulp inflammation could induce B3galt2 expression in TG, and that B3galt2 might play a regulatory role in TG neuronal sensitization. These findings suggest that B3galt2 may play an important role in trigeminal neuronal sensitization induced by peripheral inflammation via mediating TLR4/NFκB signaling pathway.

AB  - Abstract
Neuropathic pain is absent in infants and emergent years after injury. Adult spinal cord microglia play a key role in initiating neuropathic pain, and modulation of microglia is a potential target for treating neuropathic pain. In this study, we evaluated the role of microglia after infant peripheral nerve injury and the effect of exercise on the delayed-onset neuropathic pain. Rat pups received spared nerve injury, and behavior tests were performed to evaluate their pain threshold. qPCR, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot were used for M1 and M2 marker expression analysis. In contrast to the microglial polarization to the M1 phenotype observed in the adult spinal cord, in infant nerve injury, microglial polarization immediately shifted to the M2 phenotype. In adolescence, microglia polarized to the M1 phenotype, which was concomitant with the emergence of neuropathic pain. Exercise shifted spinal cord microglia polarization to the M2 phenotype and reduced neuropathic pain. In addition, IL-10 increased and TNF-α decreased after exercise, and intrathecal injection of the IL-10 antibody reduced the exercise-induced analgesia. Our study found that infant nerve injury induced delayed spinal cord microglia polarization to the M1 phenotype and that exercise was effective in the treatment of delayed adolescent neuropathic pain via the modulation of microglial polarization.

AB  - Abstract
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have enormous potential as novel cell-based therapies, but their effectiveness depends on stem cell differentiation and specific signaling regulators, which remain poorly understood. In this study, a kisspeptin peptide (KP-10) was used at different dosages to determine whether rhesus macaque-derived tau GFP-Lyon ES cells underwent kisspeptin-specific neuronal differentiation. It was found that KP-10 exhibited an anti-proliferative effect on the cells and led to morphological changes and cellular differentiation consistent with neuronal stem cell (NSC) development. The cells differentiated into Gonadotrophin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) neuronal-like cell types in response to the KP-10 treatment. There has been a previously observed connection between kisspeptin signaling, GnRH neurons and their dysfunction found in congenital disorders like idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH). Although therapeutics are a still a far-off goal, the formation and development of GnRH-positive neuronal-like cells following the application of KP-10 to Lyon NSC cells opens the door for future NSC-based therapies to treat specific reproductive disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Time perception in the millisecond and second ranges is thought to be processed by different neural mechanisms. However, whether there is a sharp boundary between these ranges and whether they are implemented in the same, overlapped or separate brain areas is still not certain. To probe the role of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), the right supplementary motor area (SMA), and the cerebellum on time perception, we temporarily altered their activity on healthy volunteers on separate sessions using transcranial magnetic stimulation with the continuous Theta Burst Stimulation (cTBS) protocol. A control session was reserved for the stimulation of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Before and after stimulation, participants were tested on a temporal categorization task using intervals in the hundreds and thousands of milliseconds ranges, as well as on a pitch categorization task which was used as a further control. We then looked for changes in the Relative Threshold and the Constant Error, which, respectively, reflect participants’ sensitivity to interval duration and their accuracy at setting an interval that acts as a boundary between categories. We found that after cTBS in all of the studied regions, the Relative Threshold, but not the Constant Error, was affected and only when hundreds of milliseconds intervals were being categorized. Categorization of thousands of milliseconds intervals and of pitch was not affected. These results suggest that the fronto-cerebellar circuit is particularly involved in the estimation of intervals in the hundreds of milliseconds range.

AB  - Abstract
Depression induced by stress is affected by sex, age and hormonal status of the animal and also by duration and type of the stressors. Moreover, higher prevalence of depression and comorbidities in women than men implies the need to include the sex variable in studies on animal models of depression. The present study was therefore initiated to evaluate the effect of sex and ovarian hormones on depression-like phenotypes in mice exposed to a 21-day Chronic Variable Mild Stress (CVMS) paradigm. Adult male, intact female and, ovariectomized (OVX) female mice exposed to CVMS displayed despair behavior, a depression-like phenotype, in all the groups. However, intact females alone, but not males and OVX females, showed anhedonia, another depression-like phenotype. At the molecular level, the expression of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a neuropeptide associated with depression, and few other stress-specific genes CRH, NR3C1, CART, and NPY were measured in the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) region of the reward circuitry. There was a significant decrease in the BDNF protein expression along with an increase in the mRNA expression of CRH, NR3C1, CART, and NPY in intact females, but not in the other two groups of mice. OVX females resembled males in behavioral and molecular responses to CVMS. 17β-Estradiol (E2) administration, not Progesterone (P4), to OVX female stress mice, mitigated despair and enhanced hedonic capacity with an increased expression of BDNF in PFC. This study strengthens the evidence for the beneficial effects of E2 administration in stress condition.

AB  - Abstract
Pain is a common complication of herpes zoster (HZ) infection which results from reactivation of a latent varicella zoster virus (VZV). A third of HZ patients’ progress to a chronic pain state known as post herpetic neuralgia (PHN), and about a quarter of these patients’ have orofacial pain. The mechanisms controlling the pain responses are not understood. Studies suggest central pathways involving the thalamus could control pain related to HZ, and studies in our lab suggest (VGAT) in the lateral thalamus influences orofacial pain. We hypothesized that thalamic VGAT functions, in part, to reduce pain, particularly orofacial pain, associated with VZV. To address this hypothesis VZV was injected into the whisker pad. Affective and motivational aspects of pain were measured using the Place Escape/Avoidance Paradigm. Thalamic neuronal activity was modulated after injecting an adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing an engineered acetylcholine Gi-protein-coupled receptor. This receptor inhibits neuronal firing when bound by clozapine-n-oxide (CNO). VGAT expression was attenuated in the thalamus by injecting an AAV construct that expressed a VGAT silencing shRNA. VZV-induced nociception was significantly decreased after administering CNO in male rats. Nociception significantly increased concomitant with increased thalamic c-fos expression after attenuating thalamic VGAT expression. These data establish that the lateral thalamus (posterior, ventral posteromedial, ventral posterolateral and/or reticular thalamic nucleus) controls VZV-induced nociception in the orofacial region, and that GABA in this region appears to reduce the response to VZV-induced nociception possibly by gating facial pain input.

Neuroinflammation is a key component of the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. The link between nicotine intake and positive outcome has been established, suggesting a role played by nicotinic receptors (nAChRs), especially α7nAChRs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential dose effects of PHA 543613 on neuron survival and striatal microglial activation in a rat model of brain excitotoxicity. A preliminary study was performed in vitro to confirm PHA 543613 agonist properties on α7nAChRs. Rats were lesioned in the right striatum with quinolinic acid (QA) and received either vehicle or PHA 543613 at 6 or 12 mg/kg twice a day until sacrifice at Day 4 post-lesion. We first compared the translocator protein quantitative autoradiography in QA-lesioned brains with [3H]DPA-714 and [3H]PK-11195. The effects of PHA 543613 on microglial activation and neuronal survival were then evaluated through [3H]DPA-714 binding and immunofluorescence staining (Ox-42, NeuN) on adjacent brain sections. We demonstrated that [3H]DPA-714 provides a better signal-to-noise ratio than [3H]PK-11195. Furthermore, we showed that repeated PHA 543613 administration at a dose of 12 mg/kg to QA-lesioned rats significantly protected neurons and reduced the intensity of microglial activation. This study reinforces the hypothesis that α7nAChR agonists can provide beneficial effects in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases through potential modulation of microglial activation.

AB  - Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by progressive dopamine depletion and a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Treadmill exercise is a promising non-pharmacological approach for reducing the risk of PD and other neuroinflammatory disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of treadmill exercise on α-synuclein-induced neuroinflammation and neuronal cell death in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD. Eight weeks of treadmill exercise improved motor deficits and reduced α-synuclein expression, a major causative factor of PD-like symptoms, in MPTP mice. Treadmill exercise also down-regulated the expression of toll-like receptor 2 and its associated downstream signaling molecules, including myeloid differentiation factor-88, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6, and transforming growth factor-β-activated protein kinase 1. These effects were associated with reduced ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 expression, decreased IκBα and nuclear transcription factor-κB phosphorylation, decreased tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin-1β expression, and decreased NADPH oxidase subunit expression in the SNpc and striatum. Additionally, it promoted the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and the dopamine transporter, as well as plasma dopamine levels, in MPTP mice; these effects were associated with decreased caspase-3 expression and cleavage, as well as increased Bcl-2 expression in the SNpc. Taken together, our data suggest that treadmill exercise improves MPTP-associated motor deficits by exerting neuroprotective effects in the SNpc and striatum, supporting the notion that treadmill exercise is useful as a non-pharmacological tool for the management of PD.

AB  - Abstract
Dopaminergic neuronal injury in the substantia nigra (SN) is a pathological hallmark of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the underlying mechanism of this injury remains elusive. Since fibroblast growth factor 18 (FGF18) is involved in midbrain development and has been reported to protect neurons from ischemic injury, we investigated whether FGF18 exerted a protective effect on dopaminergic neurons in the SN. In vitro data showed that FGF18 significantly ameliorated the neurotoxicity of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) through the AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway. Further study of the 6-OHDA-induced PD rat model indicated that FGF18 improved the behavioral dysfunction in PD rats and reduced the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neuronal loss in the SN. In addition, 6-OHDA induced a loss of TH-positive fibers that was reversed by pretreatment with FGF18. Taken together, these data suggest that FGF18 plays a protective role against parkinsonian neurodegeneration in the nigrostriatal system in a 6-OHDA-induced PD rat model and that further drug discovery based on FGF18 has a potential role for PD therapy.

AB  - Abstract
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are shown to be involved in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. However, because GPCRs include a large family of membrane receptors, it is unclear which specific GPCR or pathway with rational ligands can become effective therapeutic targets for AD. Amylin receptor (AmR) is a GPCR that mediates several activities, such as improving glucose metabolism, relaxing cerebrovascular structure, modulating inflammatory reactions and potentially enhancing neural regeneration. Recent studies show that peripheral treatments with amylin or its clinical analog, pramlintide, reduced several components of AD pathology, including amyloid plaques, tauopathy, neuroinflammation and other components in the brain, corresponding with improved learning and memory in AD mouse models. Because amylin shares a similar secondary structure with amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), I propose that the AmR/GPCR pathway is disturbed by a large amount of Aβ in the AD brain, leading to tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation and neuronal death in the pathological cascade. Amylin-type peptides, readily crossing the blood–brain barrier (BBB), are the rational ligands to enhance this GPCR pathway and may exhibit utility as novel therapeutic agents for treating AD.

AB  - Abstract
Reduced serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission is postulated to underlie the pathogenesis of depression. The serotonin transporter (SERT) and 5-HT1A auto-receptors act in concert to ensure homeostasis of serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission and regulation of their cell surface expression represent efficient mechanisms to maintain this homeostasis. Thus, we investigated the changes in the subcellular distribution of SERT and 5-HT1A receptors (5-HT1AR) in the rat olfactory bulbectomy model of depression using immuno-gold labeling and electron microscopy, and examined the effect of chronic treatment with the antidepressant, fluoxetine, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on the subcellular distribution of SERT and 5-HT1AR. The density of plasma membrane labeling of 5-HT1A auto-receptors on dendrites of dorsal raphe neurons was increased after bulbectomy, but the 5-HT1A hetero-receptor membrane labeling on dendrites of CA3 hippocampal neurons was not. The density of membrane labeling of SERTs was increased both in dendrites of dorsal raphe neuron and axon terminals in the hippocampus after bulbectomy. However, the proportion of 5-HT1AR and SERT membrane labeling relative to total labeling was unchanged, suggesting an increase in protein levels. The increases in 5-HT1AR and SERTs membrane labeling induced by bulbectomy were reversed by chronic fluoxetine treatment, and these changes were associated with a reduction in the relative proportion of membrane versus total labeling, consistent with a protein shift between subcellular compartments. Our findings support the hypothesis that changes in efficacy of serotonergic neurotransmission in this model of depression depends on both activity and density of cell surface-expressed SERT and 5-HT1A auto-receptors.

AB  - Abstract
Goal-oriented arm movements are characterized by a balance between speed and accuracy. The relation between speed and accuracy has been formalized by Fitts’ law and predicts a linear increase in movement duration with task constraints. Up to now this relation has been investigated on a short-time scale only, that is during a single experimental session, although chronobiological studies report that the motor system is shaped by circadian rhythms. Here, we examine whether the speed–accuracy trade-off could vary during the day. Healthy adults carried out arm-pointing movements as accurately and fast as possible toward targets of different sizes at various hours of the day, and variations in Fitts’ law parameters were scrutinized. To investigate whether the potential modulation of the speed–accuracy trade-off has peripheral and/or central origins, a motor imagery paradigm was used as well. Results indicated a daily (circadian-like) variation for the durations of both executed and mentally simulated movements, in strictly controlled accuracy conditions. While Fitts’ law was held for the whole sessions of the day, the slope of the relation between movement duration and task difficulty expressed a clear modulation, with the lowest values in the afternoon. This variation of the speed–accuracy trade-off in executed and mental movements suggests that, beyond execution parameters, motor planning mechanisms are modulated during the day. Daily update of forward models is discussed as a potential mechanism.

AB  - Abstract
The study was undertaken to explore the cell-specific streptozotocin (STZ)-induced mechanistic alterations. STZ-induced rodent model is a well-established experimental model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and in our previous studies we have established it as an in vitro screening model of AD by employing N2A neuronal cells. Therefore, STZ was selected in the present study to understand the STZ-induced cell-specific alterations by utilizing neuronal N2A and astrocytes C6 cells. Both neuronal and astrocyte cells were treated with STZ at 10, 50, 100 and 1000 μM concentrations for 48 h. STZ exposure caused significant decline in cellular viability and augmented cytotoxicity of cells involving astrocytes activation. STZ treatment also disrupted the energy metabolism by altered glucose uptake and its transport in both cells as reflected with decreased expression of glucose transporters (GLUT) 1/3. The consequent decrease in ATP level and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential was also observed in both the cells. STZ caused increased intracellular calcium which could cause the initiation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Significant upregulation of ER stress-related markers were observed in both cells after STZ treatment. The cellular communication of astrocytes and neurons was altered as reflected by increased expression of connexin 43 along with DNA fragmentation. STZ-induced apoptotic death was evaluated by elevated expression of caspase-3 and PI/Hoechst staining of cells. In conclusion, study showed that STZ exert alike biochemical alterations, ER stress and cellular apoptosis in both neuronal and astrocyte cells.

AB  - Abstract
The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) consists of multiple anatomically distinct nuclei. The lateral division, which receives dense noradrenergic innervation, has been implicated in cardiovascular regulation and modulation of responses to stress. This study is performed to identify the cardiovascular and single-unit responses of the lateral BST to norepinephrine (NE), involved adrenoceptors, and possible interaction with GABAergic system of the BST in urethane-anesthetized rats. NE, adrenoreceptor antagonists, and GABAA antagonist were microinjected into the lateral division of BST, while arterial pressure (AP), heart rate (HR), and single-unit responses were simultaneously recorded.

NE microinjected into the lateral division of BST produced depressor and bradycardic responses. The decrease in AP and HR to NE was blocked by prazosin, an α1-adrenoreceptor antagonist, but not by yohimbine, an α2 antagonist.

Furthermore, injections of the GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline methiodide (BMI), into the lateral BST abolished the NE-induced depressor and bradycardic responses. We also observed single-unit responses consisting of excitatory and inhibitory responses correlated with cardiovascular function to the microinjection of NE. In conclusion, these data provide the first evidence that microinjection of NE in the lateral division of BST produces depressor and bradycardic responses in urethane-anesthetized rat. The depressor and bradycardiac response are mediated by local α1- but not α2-adrenoceptors. α1-AR activates the GABAergic system within the BST, which in turn produces depressor and bradycardic responses.

AB  - Abstract
This study focuses on the important question whether brain activity recorded from anesthetized, paralyzed animals is comparable to that recorded from awake, behaving ones. We compared neuronal activity recorded from the caudate nucleus (CN) of two halothane-anesthetized, paralyzed and two awake, behaving cats. In both models, extracellular recordings were made from the CN during static and dynamic visual stimulation. The anesthesia was maintained during the recordings by a gaseous mixture of air and halothane (1.0%). The behaving animals were trained to perform a visual fixation task. Based on their electrophysiological properties, the recorded CN neurons were separated into three different classes: phasically active (PANs), high firing (HFNs), and tonically active (TANs) neurons. Halothane anesthesia significantly decreased the background activity of the CN neurons in all three classes. The anesthesia had the most remarkable suppressive effect on PANs, where the background activity was consistently under 1 spike/s. The analysis of these responses was almost impossible due to the extremely low activity. The evoked responses during both static and dynamic visual stimulation were obvious in the behaving cats. On the other hand, only weak visual responses were found in some neurons of halothane anesthetized cats. These results show that halothane gas anesthesia has a marked suppressive effect on the feline CN. We suggest that for the purposes of the visual and related multisensory/sensorimotor electrophysiological exploration of the CN, behaving animal models are preferable over anesthetized ones.

AB  - Abstract
Carvacrol is a monoterpene that has been linked to neuroprotection in several animal models of neurodegeneration, including ischemia, epilepsy and traumatic neuronal injury. In this study, we investigated the effects of carvacrol (i.p.) upon the neurodegeneration induced by 6-hydroxy-dopamine unilateral intrastriatal injections in mice. We have also used the cylinder test to assess the behavioral effects of carvacrol in that model of Parkinson’s disease, and immunoblots to evaluate the levels of caspase-3 and TRPM7, one of major targets of carvacrol. Behavioral testing revealed that carvacrol largely reduced the asymmetrical use of the forelimbs induced by unilateral 6-hydroxy-dopamine. Carvacrol dramatically reduced the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase immunostaining both in the substantia nigra and in the striatum that are typical of the model. Immunoblots for tyrosine hydroxylase confirmed this effect. Caspase-3 levels were very high after toxin injections, but carvacrol appeared to reduce them to control levels. Finally, TRPM7, observed by immunoblots, increased after 6-hydroxy-dopamine, suggesting the involvement of this cation channel in the ensuing neurodegenerative process. The present data suggest that carvacrol promotes a marked neuroprotection in the 6-hydroxy-dopamine model of Parkinson’s disease, possibly by its non-specific blocking effect upon TRPM7 channels.

AB  - Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain cancer with limited treatments and poor patient survival. GBM tumors are heterogeneous containing a complex mixture of dividing cells, differentiated cells, and cancer stem cells. It is unclear, however, how these different cell populations contribute to tumor growth or whether they exhibit differential responses to chemotherapy. Here we set out to address these questions using a zebrafish xenograft transplant model (Welker et al., 2016). We found that a small population of differentiated vimentin-positive tumor cells, but a majority of Sox2-positive putative cancer stem cells, were dividing during tumor growth. We also observed co-expression of Sox2 and GFAP, another suggested marker of glioma cancer stem cells, indicating that the putative cancer stem cells in GBM9 tumors expressed both of these markers. To determine how these different tumor cell populations responded to chemotherapy, we treated animals with temozolomide (TMZ) and assessed these cell populations immediately after treatment and 5 and 10 days after treatment cessation. As expected we found a significant decrease in dividing cells after treatment. We also found a significant decrease in vimentin-positive cells, but not in Sox2 or GFAP-positive cells. However, the Sox2-positive cells significantly increased 5 days after TMZ treatment. These data support that putative glioma cancer stem cells are more resistant to TMZ treatment and may contribute to tumor regrowth after chemotherapy.

AB  - Abstract
Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is an important neuroprotective factor in cerebral ischemia, and it has been reported that NAMPT inhibitors can aggravate neuronal injury in the acute phase. However, because it is a cytokine, NAMPT participates in many inflammatory diseases in the peripheral system, and its inhibitors have therapeutic effects. Following cerebral ischemia, the peripheral and resident inflammatory and immune cells produce many pro-inflammatory mediators in the ischemic area, which induce neuroinflammation and impair the brain. However, the effects of NAMPT inhibitors in the neuroinflammation after ischemic brain injury remain unknown. Here, we found that FK866, a potent NAMPT inhibitor, decreased the level of TNF-α, NAMPT and IL-6 in the ischemic brain tissue one day after middle-cerebral-artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R), improved neurological dysfunction, decreased infarct volume and neuronal loss, and inhibited microgliosis and astrogliosis 14 days after MCAO/R. The expression of NAMPT protein was induced in Iba1-positive microglia/macrophages in the ischemia core 14 days after MCAO/R. In vitro studies show that oxygen-glucose deprivation and recovery (OGD/R) activate microglia. Activated microglia increased the activity of NF-κB, increased the mRNA synthesis of TNF-α, NAMPT and IL-6, and increased the secretion of TNF-α, NAMPT and IL-6. On the other hand, NAMPT can act synergistically with other cytokines and activate microglia. FK866 strongly inhibited these changes and alleviated OGD/R-induced activation of microglia. As such, NAMPT is a crucial determinant of cellular inflammation after cerebral ischemia. NAMPT inhibitors are novel compounds to protect neuronal injury from ischemia via anti-inflammatory effects.

AB  - Abstract
From a view point of the glutamate excitotoxicity theory, several studies have suggested that abnormal glutamate homeostasis via dysfunction of glial glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) may underlie neurodegeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, the detailed role of GLT-1 in the pathogenies of ALS remains controversial. To assess this issue, here we elucidated structural alterations associated with dysregulation of glutamate homeostasis using SOD1G93A mice, a genetic model of familial ALS. We first examined the viability of α-motoneurons in the lumbar spinal cord of SOD1G93A mice. Measurement of the soma size and density indicated that α-motoneurons might be intact at 9 weeks of age (presymptomatic stage), then soma shrinkage began at 15 weeks of age (progressive stage), and finally neuronal density declined at 21 weeks of age (end stage). Next, we carried out the line profile analysis, and found that the coverage of α-motoneurons by GLT-1-positive (GLT-1+) astrocytic processes was decreased only at 21 weeks of age, while the reduction of coverage of α-motoneurons by synaptophysin-positive (SYP+) presynaptic terminals began at 15 weeks of age. Interestingly, the coverage of α-motoneurons by VGluT2+ presynaptic terminals was transiently increased at 9 weeks of age, and then gradually decreased towards 21 weeks of age. On the other hand, there were no time-dependent alterations in the coverage of α-motoneurons by GABAergic presynaptic terminals. These findings suggest that VGluT2 and GLT-1 may be differentially involved in the pathogenesis of ALS via abnormal glutamate homeostasis at the presymptomatic stage and end stage of disease, respectively.

Dyslexia is an impairment of reading and spelling that affects both children and adults even after many years of schooling. Dyslexic readers have deficits in the integration of auditory and visual inputs but the neural mechanisms of the deficits are still unclear. This fMRI study examined the neural processing of auditorily presented German numbers 0–9 and videos of lip movements of a German native speaker voicing numbers 0–9 in unimodal (auditory or visual) and bimodal (always congruent) conditions in dyslexic readers and their matched fluent readers. We confirmed results of previous studies that the superior temporal gyrus/sulcus plays a critical role in audiovisual speech integration: fluent readers showed greater superior temporal activations for combined audiovisual stimuli than auditory-/visual-only stimuli. Importantly, such an enhancement effect was absent in dyslexic readers. Moreover, the auditory network (bilateral superior temporal regions plus medial PFC) was dynamically modulated during audiovisual integration in fluent, but not in dyslexic readers. These results suggest that superior temporal dysfunction may underly poor audiovisual speech integration in readers with dyslexia.

AB  - Abstract
Nicotine is one of the most addictive substances known, targeting multiple memory systems, including the ventral and dorsal striatum. One form of neuroplasticity commonly associated with nicotine is dendrite remodeling. Nicotine-induced dendritic remodeling of ventral striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) is well-documented. Whether MSN dendrites in the dorsal striatum undergo a similar pattern of nicotine-induced structural remodeling is unknown. A morphometric analysis of Golgi-stained MSNs in rat revealed a natural asymmetry in dendritic morphology across the mediolateral axis, with larger, more complex MSNs found in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS). Chronic nicotine produced a lasting (at least 21 day) expansion in the dendritic complexity of MSNs in the DLS, but not dorsomedial striatum (DMS). Given prior evidence that MSN subtypes can be distinguished based on dendritic morphology, MSNs were segregated into morphological subpopulations based on the number of primary dendrites. Analysis of these subpopulations revealed that DLS MSNs with more primary dendrites were selectively remodeled by chronic nicotine exposure and remodeling was specific to the distal-most portions of the dendritic arbor. Co-administration of the dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) antagonist SCH23390 completely reversed the selective effects of nicotine on DLS MSN dendrite morphology, supporting a causal role for dopamine signaling at D1 receptors in nicotine-induced dendrite restructuring. Considering the functional importance of the DLS in shaping and expressing habitual behavior, these data support a model in which nicotine induces persistent and selective changes in the circuit connectivity of the DLS that may promote and sustain addiction-related behavior.

AB  - Abstract
Cognitive flexibility is the ability to switch between different rules or concepts and behavioral flexibility is the overt physical manifestation of these shifts. Behavioral flexibility is essential for adaptive responses and commonly measured by reversal learning and set-shifting performance in rodents. Both tasks have demonstrated vulnerability to stress with effects dependent upon stressor type and number of repetitions. This review compares the effects of stress on reversal learning and set-shifting to provide insight into the differential effect of stress on cognition. Acute and short-term repetition of stress appears to facilitate reversal learning whereas the longer term repetition of stress impairs reversal learning. Stress facilitated intradimensional set-shifting within a single, short-term stress protocol but otherwise generally impaired set-shifting performance in acute and repeated stress paradigms. Chronic unpredictable stress impairs reversal learning and set-shifting whereas repeated cold intermittent stress selectively impairs reversal learning and has no effect on set-shifting. In considering the mechanisms underlying the effects of stress on behavioral flexibility, pharmacological manipulations performed in conjunction with stress are also reviewed. Blocking corticosterone receptors does not affect the facilitation of reversal learning following acute stress but the prevention of corticosterone synthesis rescues repeated stress-induced set-shifting impairment. Enhancing post-synaptic norepinephrine function, serotonin availability, and dopamine receptor activation rescues and/or prevents behavioral flexibility performance following stress. While this review highlights a lack of a standardization of stress paradigms, some consistent effects are apparent. Future studies are necessary to specify the mechanisms underlying the stress-induced impairments of behavioral flexibility, which will aid in alleviating these symptoms in patients with some psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Reversal learning paradigms are among the most widely used tests of cognitive flexibility and have been used as assays, across species, for altered cognitive processes in a host of neuropsychiatric conditions. Based on recent studies in humans, non-human primates, and rodents, the notion that reversal learning tasks primarily measure response inhibition, has been revised. In this review, we describe how cognitive flexibility is measured by reversal learning and discuss new definitions of the construct validity of the task that are serving as a heuristic to guide future research in this field. We also provide an update on the available evidence implicating certain cortical and subcortical brain regions in the mediation of reversal learning, and an overview of the principal neurotransmitter systems involved.

AB  - Abstract
In a continuously changing environment, in which behavioral outcomes are rarely certain, animals must be able to learn to integrate feedback from their choices over time and adapt to changing reward contingencies to maintain flexible behavior. The orbitofrontal region of prefrontal cortex (OFC) has been widely implicated as playing a role in the ability to flexibly control behavior. We used a probabilistic reversal learning task to measure rats’ behavioral flexibility and its neural basis in the activity of single neurons in OFC. In this task, one lever, designated as ‘correct’, was rewarded at a high probability (80%) and a second, spatially distinct lever, designated as ‘incorrect’, was rewarded at a low probability (20%). Once rats reached a learning criterion for reliably selecting the correct lever, reward contingencies of the two levers were switched, and daily sessions were conducted until rats reliably selected the new correct lever. All rats performed the initial Acquisition and subsequent Reversal successfully, with more sessions needed to learn the Reversal. OFC neurons were recorded during five behavioral sessions spanning Acquisition and Reversal learning. The dominant pattern of neural responding in OFC, identified by principal component analysis of the population of neurons recorded, was modulated by reward outcome across behavioral sessions. Generally, activity was higher following rewarded choices than unrewarded. However, there was a correlation between reduced responses to reward following incorrect choices and the establishment of the preference for the correct lever. These results show how signaling by individual OFC neurons may participate in the flexible adaptation of behavior under changing reward contingencies.

AB  - Abstract
Central infusion of the Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor, ouabain in rats serves as an animal model of mania because it leads to hyperactivity, as well as reproduces ion dysregulation and reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels similar to that observed in bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder is also associated with cognitive inflexibility and working memory deficits. It is unknown whether ouabain treatment in rats leads to similar cognitive flexibility and working memory deficits. The present study examined the effects of an intracerebral ventricular infusion of ouabain in rats on spontaneous alternation, probabilistic reversal learning and BDNF expression levels in the frontal cortex. Ouabain treatment significantly increased locomotor activity, but did not affect alternation performance in a Y-maze. Ouabain treatment selectively impaired reversal learning in a spatial discrimination task using an 80/20 probabilistic reinforcement procedure. The reversal learning deficit in ouabain-treated rats resulted from an impaired ability to maintain a new choice pattern (increased regressive errors). Ouabain treatment also decreased sensitivity to negative feedback during the initial phase of reversal learning. Expression of BDNF mRNA and protein levels was downregulated in the frontal cortex which also negatively correlated with regressive errors. These findings suggest that the ouabain model of mania may be useful in understanding the neuropathophysiology that contributes to cognitive flexibility deficits and test potential treatments to alleviate cognitive deficits in bipolar disorder.

AB  - Abstract
Cognitive biases may play a significant role in disorders of decision making such as pathological gambling and addiction. Understanding the neurobiology of these biases could lead to more effective pharmacological and therapeutic treatments for disorders in which aberrant decision making is prominent. The rodent Betting Task (rBT) was designed to measure one commonly observed decision-making heuristic in rodents, namely “escalation of commitment” in which subjects become more risk averse as the stakes increase, even if the odds of success remain constant. In the rodent task, the animal is presented with a choice between two options of equivalent expected value, such that reward on one option is guaranteed while the other has a 50% chance of double the prize or nothing. Past work has shown that a subset of animals (termed wager sensitive) adopt an irrationally risk-averse choice preference in which they shift their choice away from the uncertain option as the bet size grows larger. In the current study, the orbitofrontal (OFC), prelimbic (PrL), and infralimbic cortex (IL) were inactivated to evaluate the contributions made by these regions to choice behavior on the rBT. Inactivation of the OFC (but not the IL or the PrL) selectively ameliorated the risk-averse choice pattern characteristic of wager-sensitive animals. This finding suggests that the OFC may have a relatively unique role in promoting this type of non-normative decision-making under uncertainty, an effect that is potentially related to its role in representing the subjective value of reinforcing outcomes.

AB  - Abstract
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a common neuropsychiatric disorder with unknown molecular underpinnings. Identification of genetic and non-genetic risk factors has largely been elusive, primarily because of a lack of power. In contrast, neuroimaging has consistently implicated the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuits in OCD. Pharmacological treatment studies also show specificity, with consistent response of OCD symptoms to chronic treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitors; although most patients are left with residual impairment. In theory, animal models could provide a bridge from the neuroimaging and pharmacology data to an understanding of pathophysiology at the cellular and molecular level. Several mouse models have been proposed using genetic, immunological, pharmacological, and optogenetic tools. These experimental model systems allow testing of hypotheses about the origins of compulsive behavior. Several models have generated behavior that appears compulsive-like, particularly excessive grooming, and some have demonstrated response to chronic serotonin reuptake inhibitors, establishing both face validity and predictive validity. Construct validity is more difficult to establish in the context of a limited understanding of OCD risk factors. Our current models may help us to dissect the circuits and molecular pathways that can elicit OCD-relevant behavior in rodents. We can hope that this growing understanding, coupled with developing technology, will prepare us when robust OCD risk factors are better understood.

AB  - Abstract
The adolescent period in mammals is a critical period of brain maturation and thus represents a time of susceptibility to environmental insult, e.g. psychosocial stress and/or drugs of abuse, which may cause lasting impairments in brain function and behavior and even precipitate symptoms in at-risk individuals. One likely effect of these environmental insults is to increase oxidative stress in the developing adolescent brain. Indeed, there is increasing evidence that redox dysregulation plays an important role in the development of schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders and that GABA interneurons are particularly susceptible to alterations in oxidative stress. The current study sought to model this adolescent neurochemical “stress” by exposing mice to the dopamine transporter inhibitor GBR12909 (5 mg/kg; IP) during adolescence (postnatal day 35–44) and measuring the resultant effect on locomotor behavior and probabilistic reversal learning as well as GABAergic interneurons and oxidative stress in adulthood. C57BL6/J mice exposed to GBR12909 showed increased activity in a novel environment and increased impulsivity as measured by premature responding in the probabilistic reversal learning task. Adolescent GBR12909-exposed mice also showed decreased parvalbumin (PV) immunoreactivity in the prefrontal cortex, which was accompanied by increased oxidative stress in PV+ neurons. These findings indicate that adolescent exposure to a dopamine transporter inhibitor results in loss of PV in GABAergic interneurons, elevations in markers of oxidative stress, and alterations in behavior in adulthood.

AB  - Abstract
The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for the ability to flexibly adapt established patterns of behavior in response to a change in environmental contingencies. Impaired behavioral flexibility results in maladaptive strategies such as perseveration on response options that no longer produce a desired outcome. Pharmacological manipulations of prefrontal cortical GABAergic signaling modulate behavioral flexibility in animal models, and prefrontal cortical interneuron dysfunction is implicated in impaired behavioral flexibility that accompanies neuropsychiatric disease. As deficits in behavioral flexibility also emerge during the normal aging process, the goal of this study was to determine the role of GABAergic signaling, specifically via prefrontal cortical GABA(B) receptors, in such age-related deficits. Young and aged rats were trained in a set shifting task performed in operant chambers. First, rats learned to discriminate between two response levers to obtain a food reward on the basis of a cue light illuminated above the correct lever. Upon acquisition of this initial discrimination, the contingencies were shifted such that rats had to ignore the cue light and respond on the levers according to their left/right positions. Both young and aged rats acquired the initial discrimination similarly; however, aged rats were impaired relative to young following the set shift. Among aged rats, GABA(B) receptor expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was strongly correlated with set shifting, such that lower expression was associated with worse performance. Subsequent experiments showed that intra-mPFC administration of the GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen enhanced set shifting performance in aged rats. These data directly link GABAergic signaling via GABA(B) receptors to impaired behavioral flexibility associated with normal aging.

AB  - Abstract
Amphetamine and other drugs of abuse have both short-term and long-lasting effects on brain function, and drug sensitization paradigms often result in chronic impairments in behavioral flexibility. Here we show that acute amphetamine administration temporarily renders rats less sensitive to reward omission, as revealed by a decrease in lose-shift responding during a binary choice task. Intracerebral infusions of amphetamine into the ventral striatum did not affect lose-shift responding but did increase impulsive behavior in which rats chose to check both reward feeders before beginning the next trial. In contrast to acute systemic and intracerebral infusions, sensitization through repeated exposure induced long-lasting increased sensitivity to reward omission. These treatments did not affect choices on trials following reward delivery (i.e. win-stay responding), and sensitization increased spine density in the sensorimotor striatum. The dichotomous effects of amphetamine on short-term and long-term loss sensitivity, and the null effect on win-stay responding, are consistent with a shift of behavioral control to the sensorimotor striatum after drug sensitization. These data provide a new demonstration of such a shift in a novel task unrelated to drug administration, and suggests that the dominance of sensorimotor control persists over many hundreds of trials after sensitization.

AB  - Abstract
Striatal dopamine (DA) plays a central role in reward-related learning and behavioral adaptation to changing environments. Recent studies suggest that rather than being broadcast as a uniform signal throughout the entire region, DA release dynamics diverge between different striatal regions. In a previous study, we showed that phasic DA release patterns in the ventromedial striatum (VMS) rapidly adapt during reversal learning. However, it is unknown how DA dynamics in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) are modulated during such adaptive behavior. Here, we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to measure phasic DA release in the DLS during spatial reversal learning. In the DLS, we observed minor DA release after the onset of a visual cue signaling reward availability, followed by more pronounced DA release during more proximal reward cues (e.g., lever extension) and execution of the operant response (i.e., lever press), both in rewarded and non-rewarded trials. These release dynamics (minor DA after onset of the predictive visual cue, prominent DA during the operant response) did not change significantly during or following a reversal of response-reward contingencies. Notably, the DA increase to the lever press did not reflect a general signal related to the initiation of any motivated motor response, as we did not observe DA release when rats initiated nose pokes into the food receptacle during inter-trial intervals. This suggests that DA release in the DLS occurs selectively during the initiation and execution of a learned operant response.

Together with our previous results obtained in the VMS, these findings reveal distinct phasic DA release patterns during adaptation of established behavior in DLS and VMS. The VMS DA signal, which is highly sensitive to reversal of response-reward contingences, may provide a teaching signal to guide reward-related learning and facilitate behavioral adaptation, whereas DLS DA may reflect a ‘response execution signal’ largely independent of outcome, that may be involved in initiation and energizing of operant behavior.

To thrive in a changing environment, organisms evolved strategies for rapidly modifying their behavioral responses to sensory stimuli. In this review, we investigate the role of sensory cortical circuits in these flexible behaviors. First, we provide a framework for classifying tasks in which flexibility is required. We then present studies in animal models which demonstrate that responses of sensory cortical neurons depend on the expected outcome associated with a stimulus. Last, we discuss inactivation studies which indicate that sensory cortex facilitates behavioral flexibility, but is not always required for adapting to changes in environmental conditions. This analysis provides insights into the contributions of cortical and subcortical sensory circuits to flexibility in behavior.

AB  - Abstract
Cognitive flexibility, the ability to adjust behavior in response to new and unexpected conditions in the environment, is essential for adaptation to new challenges and survival. The cholinergic system is an important modulator of this complex behavior however, the exact cholinergic circuits involved in this modulation and the precise influence of acetylcholine (ACh) in the process is still not fully understood. Here we review the role of different cholinergic circuits in cognitive flexibility. Strong evidence indicates that cholinergic interneurons (CINs) from the dorsomedial striatum are essential for facilitating the establishment of a new selected strategy; an effect that seems to depend mainly on activation of muscarinic receptors. Cholinergic neurons from the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (nBM), which project to the prefrontal cortex, seem to modulate the initial inhibition of a previously learned strategy, however, this concept is still controversial. Additionally, some studies suggest that basal forebrain cholinergic neurons projecting to the hippocampus, basolateral amygdala, and posterior parietal cortex may also participate on the modulation of cognitive flexibility. We highlight the fact that when investigating effects of ACh on behavioral flexibility, or any other behavior, one has to keep in mind two important particularities of the cholinergic system: (1) Many cholinergic neurons in the brain co-release glutamate or GABA with ACh. Methodologies that rely on neuronal silencing or ablation lead to simultaneous elimination of both neurotransmitters, making interpretation of results complex. (2) The cholinergic gene locus has a unique organization, with the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) gene present within the intron between the first and second exons of the choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) gene. Thus, behavioral studies using transgenic animals generated with ChAT bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones should be considered carefully, taking into consideration that these mice may overexpress VAChT and therefore, present a hypercholinergic tone that can be a confounder in behavioral studies.

AB  - Abstract
The role of the thalamus in complex cognitive behavior is a topic of increasing interest. Here we demonstrate that lesions of the nucleus reuniens (NRe), a midline thalamic nucleus interconnected with both hippocampal and prefrontal circuitry, lead to enhancement of executive behaviors typically associated with the prefrontal cortex. Rats were tested on four behavioral tasks: (1) the combined attention-memory (CAM) task, which simultaneously assessed attention to a visual target and memory for that target over a variable delay; (2) spatial memory using a radial arm maze, (3) discrimination and reversal learning using a touchscreen operant platform, and (4) decision-making with delayed outcomes. Following NRe lesions, the animals became more efficient in their performance, responding with shorter reaction times but also less impulsively than controls. This change, combined with a decrease in perseverative responses, led to focused attention in the CAM task and accelerated learning in the visual discrimination task. There were no observed changes in tasks involving either spatial memory or value-based decision making. These data complement ongoing efforts to understand the role of midline thalamic structures in human cognition, including the development of thalamic stimulation as a therapeutic strategy for acquired cognitive disabilities (Schiff, 2008; Mair et al., 2011), and point to the NRe as a potential target for clinical intervention.

AB  - Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is well known for motor deficits such as bradykinesia. However, patients often experience additional deficits in working memory, behavioral selection, decision-making and other executive functions. Like other features of PD, the incidence and severity of these cognitive symptoms differ in males and females. However, preclinical models have not been used to systematically investigate the roles that sex or sex hormones may play in these complex signs. To address this, we used a Barnes maze spatial memory paradigm to compare the effects of a bilateral nigrostriatal dopamine lesion model of early PD on cognitive behaviors in adult male and female rats and in adult male rats that were gonadectomized or gonadectomized and supplemented with testosterone or estradiol. We found that dopamine lesions produced deficits in working memory and other executive operations, albeit only in male rats where circulating androgen levels were physiological. In males where androgen levels were depleted, lesions produced no additional Barnes maze deficits and attenuated those previously linked to androgen deprivation. We also found that while most measures of Barnes maze performance were unaffected by dopamine lesions in the females, lesions did induce dramatic shifts from their preferred use of thigmotactic navigation to the use of spatially guided place strategies similar to those normally preferred by males. These and other sex- and sex hormone-specific differences in the effects of nigrostriatal dopamine lesions on executive function highlight the potential of gonadal steroids as protective and/or therapeutic for the cognitive symptoms of PD. However, their complexity also indicates the need for a more thorough understanding of androgen and estrogen effects in guiding the development of hormone therapies that might effectively address these non-motor signs.

AB  - Abstract
The mammalian brain is specialized to acquire information about environmental predictors of biologically significant events. However, environments contain an array of stimuli from which animals must ascertain which ones are meaningful in the current situation. This kind of uncertainty is inherent in the discriminative fear conditioning to context task (DFCTC) during which rats are trained to associate one context with foot-shock and another distinct context with no event. Although the contexts differ on several dimensions, they also share similarities making some cues perfect predictors, but others moderate predictors. Appropriate responding requires animals to determine which cues are relevant in the current situation and the ability to constrain their responses only to those perfect predictors. The orbital prefrontal cortex (OPFC) is thought to modulate this function as OPFC lesions result in over-generalization during DFCTC. Two experiments were conducted; the first was intended to dissociate the role of the OPFC in acquisition and expression of DFCTC, and the second intended to determine if the OPFC will also function to constrain responses during an appetitive version of DFCTC. We found that inactivation of the OPFC prior to assessment measures resulted in generalized responses on the appetitive and aversive task, however, these effects may be more prominent during the aversive task. Despite generalization during activity testing, rats were able to discriminate between the two contexts during preference. These results point to a broader role for the OPFC constraining responses to perfect predictors of biologically significant events in uncertain contexts.

AB  - Abstract
Cognitive flexibility has traditionally been considered a frontal lobe function. However, converging evidence suggests involvement of a larger brain circuit which includes the cerebellum. Reciprocal pathways connecting the cerebellum to the prefrontal cortex provide a biological substrate through which the cerebellum may modulate higher cognitive functions, and it has been observed that cognitive inflexibility and cerebellar pathology co-occur in psychiatric disorders (e.g., autism, schizophrenia, addiction). However, the degree to which the cerebellum contributes to distinct forms of cognitive flexibility and rule learning is unknown. We tested lurcher↔wildtype aggregation chimeras which lose 0–100% of cerebellar Purkinje cells during development on a touchscreen-mediated attentional set-shifting task to assess the contribution of the cerebellum to higher and lower order rule learning and cognitive flexibility. Purkinje cells, the sole output of the cerebellar cortex, ranged from 0 to 108,390 in tested mice. Reversal learning and extradimensional set-shifting were impaired in mice with ⩾ 95% Purkinje cell loss. Cognitive deficits were unrelated to motor deficits in ataxic mice. Acquisition of a simple visual discrimination and an attentional-set were unrelated to Purkinje cells. A positive relationship was observed between Purkinje cells and errors when exemplars from a novel, non-relevant dimension were introduced. Collectively, these data suggest that the cerebellum contributes to higher order cognitive flexibility, lower order cognitive flexibility, and attention to novel stimuli, but not the acquisition of higher and lower order rules. These data indicate that the cerebellar pathology observed in psychiatric disorders may underlie deficits involving cognitive flexibility and attention to novel stimuli.

AB  - Abstract
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by maladaptive patterns of repetitive, inflexible cognition and behavior that suggest a lack of cognitive flexibility. Consistent with this clinical observation, many neurocognitive studies suggest behavioral and neurobiological abnormalities in cognitive flexibility in individuals with OCD. Meta-analytic reviews support a pattern of cognitive inflexibility, with effect sizes generally in the medium range. Heterogeneity in assessments and the way underlying constructs have been operationalized point to the need for better standardization across studies, as well as more refined overarching models of cognitive flexibility and executive function (EF). Neuropsychological assessments of cognitive flexibility include measures of attentional set shifting, reversal and alternation, cued task-switching paradigms, cognitive control measures such as the Trail-Making and Stroop tasks, and several measures of motor inhibition. Differences in the cognitive constructs and neural substrates associated with these measures suggest that performance within these different domains should be examined separately. Additional factors, such as the number of consistent trials prior to a shift and whether a shift is explicitly signaled or must be inferred from a change in reward contingencies, may influence performance, and thus mask or accentuate deficits. Several studies have described abnormalities in neural activation in the absence of differences in behavioral performance, suggesting that our behavioral probes may not be adequately sensitive, but also offering important insights into potential compensatory processes. The fact that deficits of moderate effect size are seen across a broad range of classic neuropsychological tests in OCD presents a conceptual challenge, as clinical symptomatology suggests greater specificity. Traditional cognitive probes may not be sufficient to delineate specific domains of deficit in this and other neuropsychiatric disorders; a new generation of behavioral tasks that test more specific underlying constructs, supplemented by neuroimaging to provide insight into the underlying processes, may be needed.

AB  - Abstract
The global increase in rates of obesity has been accompanied by a similar surge in the number of autism diagnoses. Accumulating epidemiological evidence suggest a possible link between overweight and the risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), as well as autism severity. In laboratory animals, several studies have shown a connection between various environmental factors, including diet-induced obesity, and the development of autism-related behaviors. However, the effect of high-fat or imbalanced diet on a pre-existing autism-like phenotype is unclear.

In this study, we employed the BTBR inbred mouse strain, a well-established mouse model for autism, to assess the impact of inadequate fattening nutrition on the autism-related behavioral phenotype. Male mice were fed by high-fat diet (HFD) or control balanced diet (control) from weaning onward, and tested in a series of behavioral assays as adults. In addition, we measured the hypothalamic expression levels of several genes involved in oxytocin and dopamine signaling, in search of a possible neurobiological underlying mechanism. As an internal control, we also employed similar metabolic and behavioral measures on neurotypical C57 mice.

Compared to control-fed mice, BTBR mice fed by HFD showed marked aggravation in autism-related behaviors, manifested in increased cognitive rigidity and diminished preference for social novelty. Moreover, the total autism composite (severity) score was higher in the HFD group, and positively correlated with higher body weight. Finally, we revealed negative correlations associating dopamine signaling factors in the hypothalamus, to autism-related severity and body weight. In contrast, we found no significant effects of HFD on autism-related behaviors of C57 mice, though the metabolic effects of the diet were similar for both strains.

Our results indicate a direct causative link between diet-induced obesity and worsening of a pre-existing autism-related behavior and emphasize the need for adequate nutrition in ASD patients. These findings might also implicate the involvement of hypothalamic dopamine in mediating this effect.

AB  - Abstract
The ability to adjust behavioral responses to cues in a changing environment is crucial for survival. Activity in the medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC) is thought to both represent rules to guide behavior as well as detect and resolve conflicts between rules in changing contingencies. While lesion and pharmacological studies have supported a crucial role for mPFC in this type of set-shifting, an understanding of how mPFC represents current rules or detects and resolves conflict between different rules is still unclear. Meanwhile, medial dorsal striatum (mDS) receives major projections from mPFC and neural activity of mDS is closely linked to action selection, making the mDS a potential major player for enacting rule-guided action policies. However, exactly what is signaled by mPFC and how this impacts neural signals in mDS is not well known. In this review, we will summarize what is known about neural signals of rules and set shifting in both prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatum, as well as provide questions and directions for future experiments.

AB  - Abstract
Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) show cognitive impairments, including difficulty in shifting attention between perceptual dimensions of complex stimuli. Inactivation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been shown to be effective in ameliorating the motor abnormalities associated with striatal dopamine (DA) depletion, but it is possible that STN inactivation might result in additional, perhaps attentional, deficits. This study examined the effects of: DA depletion from the dorsomedial striatum (DMS); lesions of the STN area; and the effects of the two lesions together, on the ability to shift attentional set in the rat.

In a single session, rats performed the intradimensional/extradimensional (ID/ED) test of attentional set-shifting. This comprises a series of seven, two-choice discriminations, including acquisitions of novel discriminations in which the relevant stimulus is either in the currently attended dimension (ID) or the currently unattended dimension (ED shift) and reversals (REVs) following each acquisition stage.

Bilateral lesions were made by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the DMS, resulting in a selective impairment in reversal learning. Large bilateral ibotenic acid lesions centered on the STN resulted in an increase in trials to criterion in the initial stages, but learning rate improved within the session. There was no evidence of a ‘cost’ of set-shifting – the ED stage was completed in fewer trials than the ID stage – and neither was there a cost of reversal learning. Strikingly, combined lesions of both regions did not resemble the effects of either lesion alone and resulted in no apparent deficits.

AB  - Abstract
SHANK3 is a synaptic scaffolding protein localized in the postsynaptic density and has a crucial role in synaptogenesis and neural physiology. Deletions and point mutations in SHANK3 cause Phelan–McDermid Syndrome (PMS), and have also been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disabilities, leading to the hypothesis that reduced SHANK3 expression impairs basic brain functions that are important for social communication and cognition. Several mouse models of Shank3 deletions have been generated, varying in the specific domain deleted. Here we report impairments in cognitive function in mice heterozygous for exon 13–16 (coding for the PDZ domain) deletion. The touchscreen pairwise discrimination task was chosen by virtue of its: (a) conceptual and technical similarities to the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) and NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery used for testing cognitive functions in humans, (b) minimal demand on motor abilities, and (c) capability to measure many aspects of learning and memory and complex cognitive functions, including cognitive flexibility. The similarity between our mouse tasks and human cognitive assays means a high translational validity in future intervention studies using preclinical models. Our study revealed that Shank3B heterozygous mice (+/−) were slower to reach criterion in the pairwise visual discrimination task, and exhibited trends toward making more errors (first trial errors) and more correction errors than wildtype mice (+/+). Open field activity was normal in +/−, ruling out hypo- or hyperactivity as potential confounds in the touchscreen test. Sociability in the three chamber test was also normal in both +/+ and +/−. These results indicate a deficit in discrimination learning in the Shank3B model of PMS and ASD, suggesting that this mouse model is a useful preclinical tool for studying neurobiological mechanisms behind cognitive impairments in PMS and ASD. The current findings are the starting point for our future research in which we will investigate multiple domains of cognition and explore pharmacological interventions.

AB  - Abstract
The lateral habenula (LHb) is known to play an important role in signaling aversive or adverse events that have happened or are predicted by cues under Pavlovian conditions. In rodents, it is also required for behavioral flexibility when changes in reward outcomes signal that strategies should be changed. It is not known whether the LHb also controls appetitive behaviors when an animal is able to utilize external cues proactively to guide upcoming decisions. In order to test this, male Long–Evans rats were trained to switch between two arms of a figure eight maze based on the tone presented prior to the choice. Importantly, the tones were switched every three to six trials so rats were able establish a response pattern before being required to switch. This caused rats to rely on both proactive (tones) and retroactive information (reward feedback) to guide behavior. Inactivation of the LHb with the GABA agonists baclofen and muscimol impaired overall performance by increasing both errors when the tones are switched (switch errors) as well as on subsequent trials (perseverative errors) indicating that both proactive and retroactive information are utilized by the LHb to guide behavioral flexibility. Once a correct choice was made in a given block, LHb inactivated rats did not make more errors than controls. A control study revealed that the LHb is not required for tone or reward magnitude discrimination per se. These results demonstrate for the first time that the LHb contributes to behavioral flexibility through utilizing both proactive and retroactive information when performing appetitive tasks.

Schizophrenia (SZ) has long been associated with a variety of cognitive deficits, including reduced cognitive flexibility. More recent findings, however, point to tremendous inter-individual variability among patients on measures of cognitive flexibility/set-shifting. With an eye toward shedding light on potential sources of variability in set-shifting abilities among SZ patients, I examine the neural substrates of underlying probabilistic reversal learning (PRL) – a paradigmatic measure of cognitive flexibility – as well as neuromodulatory influences upon these systems. Finally, I report on behavioral and neuroimaging studies of PRL in SZ patients, discussing the potentially influences of illness profile and antipsychotic medications on cognitive flexibility in SZ.

To adaptively respond in a complex, changing world, animals need to flexibly update their understanding of the world when their expectations are violated. Though several brain regions in rodents and primates have been implicated in aspects of this updating, current models of orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and norepinephrine neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC-NE) suggest that each plays a role in responding to environmental change, where the OFC allows updating of prior learning to occur without overwriting or unlearning one’s previous understanding of the world that changed, while elevated tonic NE allows for increased flexibility in behavior that tracks an animal’s uncertainty. In light of recent studies highlighting a specific LC-NE projection to the OFC, in this review we discuss current models of OFC and NE function, and their potential synergy in the updating of associations following environmental change.

AB  - Abstract
Anxiety often is studied as a stand-alone construct in laboratory models. But in the context of coping with real-life anxiety, its negative impacts extend beyond aversive feelings and involve disruptions in ongoing goal-directed behaviors and cognitive functioning. Critical examples of cognitive constructs affected by anxiety are cognitive flexibility and decision making. In particular, anxiety impedes the ability to shift flexibly between strategies in response to changes in task demands, as well as the ability to maintain a strategy in the presence of distractors. The brain region most critically involved in behavioral flexibility is the prefrontal cortex (PFC), but little is known about how anxiety impacts PFC encoding of internal and external events that are critical for flexible behavior. Here we review animal and human neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies implicating PFC neural processing in anxiety-induced deficits in cognitive flexibility. We then suggest experimental and analytical approaches for future studies to gain a better mechanistic understanding of impaired cognitive inflexibility in anxiety and related disorders.

AB  - AbstractBackground
Antenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is associated with an enhanced risk of preterm birth. Very preterm-born neonates (&lt;32 weeks’ gestation) antenatally-exposed to SSRIs may show altered brain development.
Objective
To examine whether antenatal-SSRI exposure was associated with adverse neonatal brain microstructural and metabolic development using diffusion tensor and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging.
Design/Methods
Of 177 neonates enrolled, 14 (8%) were antenatally exposed to SSRIs. Neonates were scanned twice (median week 32; interquartile range [IQR]: 30.4–33.6) and again at term-equivalent age (40.1, IQR: 38.6–42.1). Using a region-of-interest approach, N-acetylaspartate to choline ratios (NAA/Cho), lactate to choline ratios, white and gray matter fractional anisotropy (FA), mean, axial, radial diffusivity (MD, AD, RD) values were extracted from white and gray matter subcortical regions. Neurodevelopment was assessed at 18 months, corrected age.
Results
SSRI-exposed neonates exhibited increased FA and decreased MD, AD and RD values in the superior white matter (p &lt; 0.05). FA values in the basal ganglia and thalamus were significantly lower in neonates antenatally exposed to SSRIs, compared to non-exposed (p = 0.004). Lower NAA/Cho values (p = 0.04) and higher Lactate/Cho values (p = 0.004) in posterior gray matter were evident in neonates exposed to SSRIs. No association with antenatal-SSRI exposure and neurodevelopment was evident.
Conclusions
Given the importance of treating depression in mothers at risk for preterm delivery, the impact of antenatal-SSRIs on early brain development requires further attention. Future research is directed at determining the mechanism of this relationship and the contribution of maternal mood.

Children exposed to extreme early-life neglect such as in institutional rearing are at heightened risk for developing depression and anxiety disorders, and internalizing problems more broadly. These outcomes are believed to be due to alterations in the development of neural circuitry that supports emotion regulation. The specific neurodevelopmental changes that contribute to these difficulties are largely unknown. This study examined whether microstructural alterations in white matter pathways predicted long-term risk for internalizing problems in institutionally reared children. Data from 69 children were drawn from the Bucharest Early Intervention Project, a randomized clinical trial of foster care for institutionally reared children. White matter was assessed using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) when children were between 8 and 10 years of age. Internalizing symptoms were assessed at the time of the MRI scan, and once children reached 12–14 years of age. Results indicated that neglect-associated alterations in the external capsule and corpus callosum partially explained links between institutional rearing status and internalizing symptoms in middle childhood and early adolescence. Findings shed light on neural mechanisms contributing to increased risk for emotional difficulties among children reared in adverse conditions and have implications for prevention and intervention.

AB  - Abstract
Thyroid hormones (THs) play an obligatory role in many fundamental processes underlying brain development and maturation. The developing embryo/fetus is dependent on maternal supply of TH. The fetal thyroid gland does not commence TH synthesis until mid gestation, and the adverse consequences of severe maternal TH deficiency on offspring neurodevelopment are well established. Recent evidence suggests that even more moderate forms of maternal thyroid dysfunction, particularly during early gestation, may have a long-lasting influence on child cognitive development and risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Moreover, these observed alterations appear to be largely irreversible after birth. It is, therefore, important to gain a better understanding of the role of maternal thyroid dysfunction on offspring neurodevelopment in terms of the nature, magnitude, time-specificity, and context-specificity of its effects. With respect to the issue of context specificity, it is possible that maternal stress and stress-related biological processes during pregnancy may modulate maternal thyroid function. The possibility of an interaction between the thyroid and stress systems in the context of fetal brain development has, however, not been addressed to date.

We begin this review with a brief overview of TH biology during pregnancy and a summary of the literature on its effect on the developing brain. Next, we consider and discuss whether and how processes related to maternal stress and stress biology may interact with and modify the effects of maternal thyroid function on offspring brain development. We synthesize several research areas and identify important knowledge gaps that may warrant further study. The scientific and public health relevance of this review relates to achieving a better understanding of the timing, mechanisms and contexts of thyroid programing of brain development, with implications for early identification of risk, primary prevention and intervention.

Advances in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) have drastically increased the survival chances of preterm infants. However, preterm infants are still exposed to a wide range of stressors during their stay in the NICU, which include painful procedures and reduced maternal contact. The activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, in response to these stressors during this critical period of brain development, has been associated with many acute and long-term adverse biobehavioral outcomes. Recent research has shown that Kangaroo care, a non-pharmacological analgesic based on increased skin-to-skin contact between the neonate and the mother, negates the adverse outcomes associated with neonatal pain and reduced maternal care, however the biological mechanism remains widely unknown. This review summarizes findings from both human and rodent literature investigating neonatal pain and reduced maternal care independently, primarily focusing on the role of the HPA axis and biobehavioral outcomes. The physiological and positive outcomes of Kangaroo care will also be discussed in terms of how dampening of the HPA axis response to neonatal pain and increased maternal care may account for positive outcomes associated with Kangaroo care.

AB  - Abstract
We tested the effect of early-life stress (ELS) – 24 h maternal deprivation (MD) at postnatal day (PND) 3 – on cognitive performance and hippocampal structure in 12–17-week-old female rats. Behavioral performance was examined in: the Elevated Plus Maze, as an index for general anxiety; the rodent Iowa gambling test, probing reward-based decision making; and the object recognition and object-in-location task, to assess non-stressful contextual memory performance. We further determined hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) volume and cell density as well as adult proliferation and neurogenesis rates. Half of the rats was treated with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone during a critical pre-pubertal developmental window (PNDs 26–28), in an attempt to ameliorate the potentially adverse behavioral consequences of ELS.

Neither MD nor treatment with the glucocorticoid antagonist affected behavioral performance of the females in any of the tasks. Also, DG structure, proliferation and neurogenesis were not different between the groups. Lack of structural differences and a behavioral phenotype in non-stressful hippocampus dependent learning tasks fits with the lack of phenotype generally reported after ELS in female but less so in male rodents. As evident from an extensive literature review, female and male animals appear to respond more similarly to early-life adversity when tested in anxiety-related tasks. This agrees with recent findings in humans suggesting that females may be relatively resilient to the structural/hippocampal effects of childhood maltreatment, but not to the anxiety and mood-related psychopathology for which childhood maltreatment is considered a risk factor.

AB  - Abstract
Aim of this systematic review is to assess short- and long-lasting effects of antenatal exposure to untreated maternal depressive symptoms. Pertinent articles were identified through combined searches of Science.gov, Cochrane library, and PubMed databases (through August 2015). Forty-three, selected articles revealed that untreated gestational depression and even depressive symptoms during pregnancy may have untoward effects on the developing fetus (hyperactivity, irregular fetal heart rate), newborns (increased cortisol and norepinephrine levels, decreased dopamine levels, altered EEG patterns, reduced vagal tone, stress/depressive-like behaviors, and increased rates of premature deaths and neonatal intensive care unit admission), and children (increased salivary cortisol levels, internalizing and externalizing problems, and central adiposity). During adolescence, an independent association exists between maternal antenatal mood symptoms and a slight increase in criminal behaviors. In contrast, the relationship between gestational depression and increased risks of prematurity and low birth weight remains controversial. Given this background, when making clinical decisions, clinicians should weigh the growing evidences suggesting the detrimental and prolonged effects in offspring of untreated antenatal depression and depressive symptoms during pregnancy against the known and emerging concerns associated with in utero exposure to antidepressants.

AB  - Abstract
Early stress in the form of repetitive neonatal pain, in infants born very preterm, is associated with long-term dysregulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and with poorer cognitive performance. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which is important in synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions is reduced by stress. Therefore the BDNF Val66Met variant, which affects secretion of BDNF, may interact with early exposure to pain-related stress in children born very preterm, to differentially affect HPA regulation that in turn may be associated with altered cognitive performance.

The aims of this study were to investigate whether in children born very preterm, the BDNF Val66Met variant modulates the association between neonatal pain-related stress and cortisol levels at age 7 years, and if cortisol levels were related to cognitive function. Furthermore, we examined whether these relationships were sex-specific. Using a longitudinal cohort design, N = 90 children born very preterm (24–32 weeks gestation) were followed from birth to age 7 years. Cortisol was assayed from hair as an index of cumulative stress and from saliva to measure reactivity to a cognitive challenge. BDNF Val66Met variant was genotyped at 7 years using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Using generalized linear modeling, in boys with the Met allele, greater neonatal pain-related stress (adjusted for clinical risk factors) predicted lower hair cortisol (p = 0.006) and higher reactivity salivary cortisol (p = 0.002). In both boys and girls with the Met allele, higher salivary cortisol reactivity was correlated with lower IQ (r = −0.60; p = 0.001) and poorer visual-motor integration (r = −0.48; p = 0.008).

Our findings show associations between lower BDNF availability (presence of the Met allele) and vulnerability to neonatal pain/stress in boys, but not girls. This exploratory study suggests new directions for research into possible mechanisms underlying how neonatal pain/stress is related to cognitive performance in children born very preterm.

AB  - Abstract
The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) plays a central role in brain development, regulation of mood, stress reactivity and risk of psychiatric disorders, and thus alterations in 5-HT signaling early in life have critical implications for behavior and mental health across the life span. Drawing on preclinical and emerging human evidence this narrative review paper will examine three key aspects when considering the consequences of early life changes in 5-HT: (1) developmental origins of variations of 5-HT signaling; (2) influence of genetic and epigenetic factors; and (3) preclinical and clinical consequences of 5-HT-related changes associated with antidepressant exposure (SSRIs). The developmental consequences of altered prenatal 5-HT signaling varies greatly and outcomes depend on an ongoing interplay between biological (genetic/epigenetic variations) and environmental factors, both pre and postnatally. Emerging evidence suggests that variations in 5-HT signaling may increase sensitivity to risky home environments, but may also amplify a positive response to a nurturing environment. In this sense, factors that change central 5-HT levels may act as ‘plasticity’ rather than ‘risk’ factors associated with developmental vulnerability. Understanding the impact of early changes in 5-HT levels offers critical insights that might explain the variations in early typical brain development that underlies behavioral risk.

AB  - Abstract
The developing brains of young children are highly sensitive to input from their social environment. Nurturing social experience during this time promotes the acquisition of social and cognitive skills and emotional competencies. However, many young children are confronted with obstacles to healthy development, including poverty, inappropriate care, and violence, and their enhanced sensitivity to the social environment means that they are highly susceptible to these adverse childhood experiences. One source of social adversity in early life can stem from parenting that is harsh, inconsistent, non-sensitive or hostile. Parenting is considered to be the cornerstone of early socio-emotional development and an adverse parenting style is associated with adjustment problems and a higher risk of developing mood and behavioral disorders. Importantly, there is a growing literature showing that an important predictor of parenting behavior is how parents, especially mothers, were parented themselves. In this review, we examine how adversity in early-life affects mothering behavior in later-life and how these effects may be perpetuated inter-generationally. Relying on studies in humans and animal models, we consider evidence for the intergenerational transmission of mothering styles. We then describe the psychological underpinnings of mothering, including responsiveness to young, executive function and affect, as well as the physiological mediators of mothering behavior, including hormones, brain regions and neurotransmitters, and we consider how development in these relevant domains may be affected by adversity experienced in early life. Finally, we explore how genes and early experience interact to predict mothering behavior, including the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms. Understanding how adverse parenting begets adverse parenting in the next generation is critical for designing interventions aimed at preventing this intergenerational cycle of early adversity.

AB  - Abstract
Adverse intrauterine environments increase vulnerability to chronic diseases across the lifespan. The hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, which integrates multiple neuronal signals and ultimately controls the response to stressors, may provide a final common pathway linking early adversity and adult diseases. Both prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and prenatal stress (PS) induce a hyperresponsive HPA phenotype in adulthood. As glucocorticoids are pivotal for the normal development of many fetal tissues including the brain, we used animal models of PAE and PS to investigate possible mechanisms underlying fetal programing of glucocorticoid signaling in the placenta and fetal brain at gestation day (GD) 21. We found that both PAE and PS dams had higher corticosterone (CORT) levels than control dams. However, 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2) enzyme levels were increased in PAE and unchanged in PS placentae, although there were no differences in 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) levels. Moreover, only PAE fetuses showed decreased body weight and increased placental weight, and hence a lower fetal/placental weight ratio, a marker of placenta efficiency, compared to all other prenatal groups. Importantly, PAE and PS differentially altered corticosteroid receptor levels in placentae and brains. In the PS condition, maternal CORT was negatively correlated with both 11β-HSD1 and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) protein levels in male and female placentae, whereas in the PAE condition, there were trends for a positive correlation between maternal CORT and 11β-HSD1, regardless of sex, and a negative correlation between maternal alcohol intake and MR in male placentae. In fetal brains, sexually dimorphic changes in MR and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) levels, and the MR/GR ratio seen in C fetuses were absent in PAE and PS fetuses. In addition, PS but not PAE female fetuses had higher MR and lower GR expression levels in certain limbic areas compared to C female fetuses. Thus the similar adult HPA hyperresponsive phenotype in PAE and PS animals likely occurs through differential effects on glucocorticoid signaling in the placenta and fetal brain.

AB  - Abstract
Volatile organic solvent abuse continues to be a worldwide health problem, including the neurobehavioral teratogenic sequelae of toluene abuse during pregnancy. Although abuse levels of prenatal toluene exposure can lead to a Fetal Solvent Syndrome, there is little research examining these effects on memory. Consumption of toluene can have detrimental effects on the developing hippocampus which could lead to specific spatial learning and memory deficits. This study used a rat model to determine how prenatal exposure to abuse levels of toluene would affect performance in a spatial learning and memory task, the Morris Water Maze (MWM). Pregnant Sprague–Dawley rats were exposed to 0, 8000 or 12,000 ppm (ppm) of toluene for 15 min twice daily from gestation day 8 (GD8) through GD20. Male and female offspring (N = 104) were observed in the MWM for 5 days beginning on postnatal day (PN) 28 and again on PN44. While prenatal toluene-exposed animals did not differ in initial acquisition in the MWM, rats prenatally exposed to 12,000 ppm toluene displayed performance deficits during a probe trial and in reversal learning on PN44. Overall, this study indicates that prenatal exposure to repeated inhaled abuse patterns of high concentrations of toluene can impair spatial memory function that persists into adolescence.

AB  - Abstract
The prenatal and postnatal early-life periods are both dynamic and vulnerable windows for brain development. During these important neurodevelopmental phases, essential processes and structures are established. Exposure to adverse events that interfere with this critical sequence of events confers a high risk for the subsequent emergence of mental illness later in life. It is increasingly accepted that the gastrointestinal microbiota contributes substantially to shaping the development of the central nervous system. Conversely, several studies have shown that early-life events can also impact on this gut community. Due to the bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain, it is possible that aberrant situations affecting either organ in early life can impact on the other. Studies have now shown that deviations from the gold standard trajectory of gut microbiota establishment and development in early life can lead not only to disorders of the gastrointestinal tract but also complex metabolic and immune disorders. These are being extended to disorders of the central nervous system and understanding how the gut microbiome shapes brain and behavior during early life is an important new frontier in neuroscience.

AB  - Abstract
Gestation is a time of profound vulnerability, as insults during pregnancy increase the lifelong risk of morbidity for the offspring. Increasingly, maternal diet is recognized as a key factor influencing the developing fetus. Poor-quality maternal diets, whether they provide an excess or an insufficiency of nutrients, lead to overt gestational growth disturbances in the offspring, and elevated risk for a common cluster of metabolic and mental disorders. Metabolic disturbances, particularly a substantially increased risk of obesity, have been linked in both maternal overnutrition and maternal undernutrition with abnormal development of the offspring hypothalamus, which serves a vital role in the central regulation of feeding. Additionally, the hypothalamus also coordinates physiological responses to stressors, and may thus play a role in vulnerability to psychiatric disease in these offspring. We examined hypothalamic molecular and endocrine responses to a psychological stressor (restraint) and a physiological stressor (lipopolysaccharide; LPS) in adult offspring from dams fed a high-fat diet or a low-protein diet during gestation and lactation. Targeted gene expression in the hypothalamus for 26 genes of interest sorted via hierarchical clustering revealed that the vast majority of these transcripts were substantially upregulated by both stressors. In contrast, offspring of maternal high-fat and low-protein diets mounted essentially no gene expression response to either stressor. However, male and female offspring of all conditions showed elevated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal glucocorticoid responses to both stressors, though the recovery of corticosterone responses after stress termination was significantly impaired in offspring of poor-quality maternal diets. Overall, it appears that the ability of the hypothalamus to respond in the immediate aftermath of stressful experiences is severely impaired in offspring of poor-quality maternal diets, regardless of whether the diet provided insufficient nutrients or excessive nutrients.

Despite long-standing interest in the role of sex on human development, the functional consequences of fetal sex on early development are not well-understood. Here we explore the gestational origins of sex as a moderator of development. In accordance with the focus of this special issue, we examine evidence for a sex differential in vulnerability to prenatal and perinatal risks. Exposures evaluated include those present in the external environment (e.g., lead, pesticides), those introduced by maternal behaviors (e.g., alcohol, opioid use), and those resulting from an adverse intrauterine environment (e.g., preterm birth). We also provide current knowledge on the degree to which sex differences in fetal neurobehavioral development (i.e., cardiac and motor patterns) are present prior to birth. Also considered are contemporaneous and persistent sex of fetus effects on the pregnant woman. Converging evidence confirms that infant and early childhood developmental outcomes of male fetuses exposed to prenatal and perinatal adversities are more highly impaired than those of female fetuses. In certain circumstances, male fetuses are both more frequently exposed to early adversities and more affected by them when exposed than are female fetuses. The mechanisms through which biological sex imparts vulnerability or protection on the developing nervous system are largely unknown. We consider models that implicate variation in maturation, placental functioning, and the neuroendocrine milieu as potential contributors. Many studies use sex as a control variable, some analyze and report main effects for sex, but those that report interaction terms for sex are scarce. As a result, the true scope of sex differences in vulnerability is unknown.

AB  - Abstract
Traumatic experiences early in life predispose animals and humans to later cognitive-behavioral, emotional, and somatic problems. In humans, traumatic experiences are strong predictors of psychiatric illness. A growing body of research has emphasized alterations in neurological structure and function that underscore phenotypic changes following trauma. However, results are mixed and imprecise. We argue that future translation of neurological findings to clinical practice will require: (1) discovery of neurobehavioral associations within a longitudinal context, (2) dissociation of trauma types and of trauma versus chronic stress, and (3) better localization of neural sequelae considerate of the fine resolution of neural circuitry. We provide a brief overview of early brain development and highlight the role of longitudinal research in unearthing brain-behavior relations in youth. We relay an emergent framework in which dissociable trauma types are hypothesized to impact distinct, rationally informed neural systems. In line with this, we discuss the long-standing challenge of separating effects of chronic stress and trauma, as these are often intertwined. We bring to light inconsistencies in localization of neural correlates of trauma, emphasizing results in medial prefrontal regions. We assert that more precise spatial brain localization will help to advance prevailing models of trauma pathways and inform future research.

AB  - Abstract
In mammals, early adverse experiences, including mother–pup interactions, shape the response of an individual to chronic stress or to stress-related diseases during adult life. This has led to the elaboration of the theory of the developmental origins of health and disease, in particular adult diseases such as cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. In addition, in humans, as stated by Massimo Fagioli’s Human Birth Theory, birth is healthy and equal for all individuals, so that mental illness develop exclusively in the postnatal period because of the quality of the relationship in the first year of life. Thus, this review focuses on the importance of programming during the early developmental period on the manifestation of adult diseases in both animal models and humans. Considering the obvious differences between animals and humans we cannot systematically move from animal models to humans. Consequently, in the first part of this review, we will discuss how animal models can be used to dissect the influence of adverse events occurring during the prenatal and postnatal periods on the developmental trajectories of the offspring, and in the second part, we will discuss the role of postnatal critical periods on the development of mental diseases in humans. Epigenetic mechanisms that cause reversible modifications in gene expression, driving the development of a pathological phenotype in response to a negative early postnatal environment, may lie at the core of this programming, thereby providing potential new therapeutic targets. The concept of the Human Birth Theory leads to a comprehension of the mental illness as a pathology of the human relationship immediately after birth and during the first year of life.

AB  - Abstract
Efr3a has been found to be involved in the functional maintenance and structural degeneration of sensory and motor nervous tissues. Our previous data have suggested that Efr3a may be associated with the initiation of the degeneration of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). In this study, we used Efr3a knockdown (Efr3a KD) and Efr3a overexpression (Efr3a OE) mice to determine the role of Efr3a in age-related hearing loss. Measurements of hearing thresholds showed that Efr3a had little or no influence on the hearing threshold at all frequencies in adult mice, whereas in an early stage of senescence, Efr3a reduction resulted in better hearing function, especially at 10 and 12 months of age. No significant differences were observed in hair cell loss among the three groups until 14 months. The number of surviving hair cells in the OE mice was lower than that in the KD mice. As indicated by the density of SGNs in the upper basal turn, the Efr3a OE mice displayed earlier and more severe degeneration than the KD mice. In addition, the p-Akt levels in the cochlear spiral ganglions were higher in adult Efr3a KD mice than in WT and OE mice, although there was no difference in Akt expression among the three groups. Our study suggests that down-regulation of Efr3a might improve hearing function and alleviate the degeneration of SGNs in an early stage of senescence, probably via enhancing the basal expression of activated Akt.

AB  - Abstract
Although dopaminergic medication improves functional mobility in individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD), its effects on walking turns are uncertain. Our goals was to determine whether dopaminergic medication improves preplanned and unplanned walking turns in individuals with PD, compared to healthy controls. Nineteen older adults with mild-to-moderate PD and 17 healthy controls performed one of the following three tasks, presented randomly: walking straight, or walking and turning 180° to the right or left. The walking direction was visually cued before starting to walk (preplanned) or after (unplanned, i.e., 0.6 m before reaching the turning point). Subjects with PD were assessed off dopaminergic medication (OFF) and on dopaminergic medication (ON) medication. Turning strategy (step and spin turns), turning performance (turning distance and body rotation) and walking pattern were analyzed for three turning steps. Irrespective of medication state and turning condition, step and spin turns followed a nearly 50:50 distribution. After intake of dopaminergic medication, subjects with PD increased their turning distance but not the amount of body rotation or their walking pattern. Compared to controls, turning impairments in subjects with PD remained while ON medication and problems regulating step width were the most prominent features of their walking pattern. Specifically, subjects with PD turned with narrower cross-over steps, i.e. when the external foot crossed over the line of progression of the internal leg. We conclude that turning impairments remained even after dopaminergic medication and problems modulating step width appears to be a critical feature for turning in PD.

AB  - Abstract
Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) is the second leading cause of dementia behind Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and is a frequent co-morbidity with AD. Despite its prevalence, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the cognitive dysfunction resulting from cerebrovascular disease. Astrocytic end-feet almost completely surround intraparenchymal blood vessels in the brain and express a variety of channels and markers indicative of their specialized functions in the maintenance of ionic and osmotic homeostasis and gliovascular signaling. These functions are mediated by end-foot enrichment of the aquaporin 4 water channel (AQP4), the inward rectifying potassium channel Kir4.1 and the calcium-dependent potassium channel MaxiK.

Using our hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) model of VCID we examined the time-course of astrocytic end-foot changes along with cognitive and neuroinflammatory outcomes. We found that there were significant astrocytic end-foot disruptions in the HHcy model. AQP4 becomes dislocalized from the end-feet, there is a loss of Kir4.1 and MaxiK protein expression, as well as a loss of the Dp71 protein known to anchor the Kir4.1, MaxiK and AQP4 channels to the end-foot membrane. Neuroinflammation occurs prior to the astrocytic changes, while cognitive impairment continues to decline with the exacerbation of the astrocytic changes.

We have previously reported similar astrocytic changes in models of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and therefore, we believe astrocytic end-foot disruption could represent a common cellular mechanism of VCID and may be a target for therapeutic development.

AB  - Abstract
Mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a serine-threonine kinase that controls several important aspects of mammalian cell function. mTOR activity is modulated by various intra- and extracellular factors; in turn, mTOR changes rates of translation, transcription, protein degradation, cell signaling, metabolism, and cytoskeleton dynamics. mTOR has been repeatedly shown to participate in neuronal development and the proper functioning of mature neurons. Changes in mTOR activity are often observed in nervous system diseases, including genetic diseases (e.g., tuberous sclerosis complex, Pten-related syndromes, neurofibromatosis, and Fragile X syndrome), epilepsy, brain tumors, and neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease). Neuroscientists only recently began deciphering the molecular processes that are downstream of mTOR that participate in proper function of the nervous system. As a result, we are gaining knowledge about the ways in which aberrant changes in mTOR activity lead to various nervous system diseases. In this review, we provide a comprehensive view of mTOR in the nervous system, with a special focus on the neuronal functions of mTOR (e.g., control of translation, transcription, and autophagy) that likely underlie the contribution of mTOR to nervous system diseases.

AB  - Abstract
Depression is one of the most prevalent and life-threatening forms of mental illness. The heavy social burden imposed by this disorder calls for a better understanding of its pathogenesis. Light deficiency is an important factor potentially leading to depression. However, how the light deficiency affects neural microcircuit underlying depression remains largely unknown. This study investigated the properties of morphology, electrophysiology, and synaptology of layer V pyramidal cells (L5PCs) in the motor cortex of a mouse model with depressive behavioral phenotype that was produced by light deprivation (LD). The depressive behavioral phenotype was characterized by increased immobility and decreased locomotor activity in behavioral tests. LD decreased burst firing neurons and suppressed the intrinsic excitability of L5PCs, and also reduced the neuronal morphological complexity as evidenced by simplified basal and apical dendrites. Moreover, LD reduced the synaptic connecting probability of L5PCs. These alterations of the simplified morphology, the suppressed excitability, and the reduced connecting probability of L5PCs together could well explain the depression-like behaviors of the mouse model. However, it was surprising to find that the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) of single L5PC connections were significantly enhanced and the paired pulse ratio (EPSP2/EPSP1) was significantly increased. These synaptological results indicate that the absolute synaptic strength of single L5PC connections was enhanced and the transmitter release probability was increased although the connections between L5PCs became sparse. Therefore, a compensation mechanism accompanied the negative changes that were consistent with the depressive behavioral phenotype. Our findings from the motor cortex of depression-like behavior mice may underlie the neural microcircuit mechanism of depression, providing insights into the pathogenesis of depression at a level of single neurons and synaptic connections.

AB  - Abstract
Sounds, like music and noise, are capable of reliably affecting individuals’ mood and emotions. However, these effects are highly variable across individuals. A putative source of variability is genetic background. Here we explored the interaction between a functional polymorphism of the dopamine D2 receptor gene (DRD2 rs1076560, G &gt; T, previously associated with the relative expression of D2S/L isoforms) and sound environment on mood and emotion-related brain activity. Thirty-eight healthy subjects were genotyped for DRD2 rs1076560 (G/G = 26; G/T = 12) and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during performance of an implicit emotion-processing task while listening to music or noise. Individual variation in mood induction was assessed before and after the task. Results showed mood improvement after music exposure in DRD2GG subjects and mood deterioration after noise exposure in GT subjects. Moreover, the music, as opposed to noise environment, decreased the striatal activity of GT subjects as well as the prefrontal activity of GG subjects while processing emotional faces. These findings suggest that genetic variability of dopamine receptors affects sound environment modulations of mood and emotion processing.

AB  - Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) in mammals leads to permanent loss of function because axons do not regenerate in the central nervous system (CNS). To date, treatments based on neutralizing inhibitory environmental cues, such as the myelin-associated growth inhibitors and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, or on adding neurotrophic factors, have had limited success in enhancing regeneration. Published studies suggested that multiple axon guidance cues (repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) family, semaphorins, ephrins, and netrins) persist in adult animals, and that their expression is upregulated after CNS injury. Moreover, many adult CNS neurons continue to express axon guidance receptors. We used the advantages of the lamprey CNS to test the hypotheses that the regenerative abilities of spinal-projecting neurons depend upon their expression of chemorepulsive guidance receptors. After complete spinal transection, lampreys recover behaviorally, and injured axons grow selectively in their correct paths. However, the large identified reticulospinal (RS) neurons in the lamprey brain are heterogeneous in their regenerative abilities – some are high regeneration capacity neurons (probability of axon regeneration &gt;50%), others are low regeneration capacity neurons (&lt;30%). Here we report that the RGM receptor Neogenin is expressed preferentially in the low regeneration capacity RS neurons that regenerate poorly, and that downregulation of Neogenin by morpholino antisense oligonucleotides enhances regeneration of RS axons after SCI. Moreover, lamprey CNS neurons co-express multiple guidance receptors (Neogenin, UNC5 and PlexinA), suggesting that the regenerative abilities of spinal-projecting neurons might reflect the summed influences of the chemorepulsive guidance receptors that they express.

We combined diffusion tension imaging (DTI) of prefrontal white matter integrity and neuropsychological measures to examine the functional neuroanatomy of human intelligence. Healthy participants completed the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Third Edition (WAIS-III) along with neuropsychological tests of attention and executive control, as measured by Trail Making Test (TMT) and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). Stochastic tractography, considered the most effective DTI method, quantified white matter integrity of the medial orbital frontal cortex (mOFC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) circuitry. Based on prior studies, we hypothesized that posterior mOFC–rACC connections may play a key structural role linking attentional control processes and intelligence. Behavioral results provided strong support for this hypothesis, specifically linking attentional control processes, measured by Trails B and WCST perseverative errors, to intelligent quotient (IQ). Hierarchical regression results indicated left posterior mOFC–rACC fractional anisotropy (FA) and Trails B performance time, but not WCST perseverative errors, each contributed significantly to IQ, accounting for approximately 33.95–51.60% of the variance in IQ scores. These findings suggested that left posterior mOFC–rACC white matter connections may play a key role in supporting the relationship of executive functions of attentional control and general intelligence in healthy cognition.

In the last decade, many studies confirmed the benefits of mental practice with motor imagery. In this review we first aimed to compile data issued from fundamental and clinical investigations and to provide the key-components for the optimization of motor imagery strategy. We focused on transcranial magnetic stimulation studies, supported by brain imaging research, that sustain the current hypothesis of a functional link between cortical reorganization and behavioral improvement. As perspectives, we suggest a model of neural adaptation following mental practice, in which synapse conductivity and inhibitory mechanisms at the spinal level may also play an important role.

Stimulus exposure duration in emotion perception research is often chosen pragmatically; however, little work exists on the consequences of stimulus duration for the processing of emotional faces. We utilized the spatiotemporal resolution capabilities of magnetoencephalography (MEG) to characterize early implicit processing of emotional and neutral faces in response to stimuli presented for 80 and 150 ms. We found that the insula was recruited to a greater degree within the short (80 ms) condition for all face categories, and this effect was more pronounced for emotional compared to neutral faces. The orbitofrontal cortex was more active in the 80-ms condition for neutral faces only, suggesting a modulation of task difficulty by both the duration and the emotional category of the stimuli. No effects on reaction time or accuracy were observed. Our findings caution that differences in stimulus duration may result in differential neural processing of emotional faces and challenge the idea that neutral faces constitute a neutral baseline.

AB  - Abstract
Glaucoma is an irreversible and blinding neurodegenerative disease of the eye, and is characterized by progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Since endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) was reported to be involved in neurodegeneration in the central nervous system, the authors aimed to develop a chronic ocular hypertension (COH) rat model simulating glaucoma and therein test the H2S level together with the retinal protein expressions of related synthases, and further investigated the effect of exogenous H2S supplement on RGC survival. COH rat model was induced by cross-linking hydrogel injection into anterior chamber, and the performance of the model was assessed by intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement, RGC counting and retinal morphological analysis. Endogenous H2S level was detected along with the retinal protein expressions of H2S-related synthases cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST) in the COH rats. Retinal H2S level and RGC survival were evaluated again after NaHS (a H2S donor) treatment in the COH rats. The results showed that the COH model succeeded in simulating glaucoma features, and retinal H2S level decreased significantly when the retinal protein expressions of CBS, CSE and 3-MST were downregulated generally in the COH rats. Furthermore, the decrease of retinal H2S level and loss of RGCs were both improved by NaHS treatment in experimental glaucoma, without obvious variation of IOP. Our study revealed that the intracameral injection of cross-linking hydrogel worked efficiently in modeling glaucoma, and H2S had protective effect on RGCs and might be involved in the pathological mechanism of glaucomatous neuropathy.

AB  - Abstract
Mutations in the Pejvakin (Pjvk) gene cause autosomal recessive hearing loss DFNB59 with audiological features of auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) or cochlear dysfunction. The precise mechanisms underlying the variable clinical phenotypes of DFNB59 remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that mice with conditional ablation of the Pjvk gene in all sensory hair cells or only in outer hair cells (OHCs) show similar auditory phenotypes with early-onset profound hearing loss. By contrast, loss of Pjvk in adult OHCs causes a slowly progressive hearing loss associated with OHC degeneration and delayed loss of inner hair cells (IHCs), indicating a primary role for pejvakin in regulating OHC function and survival. Consistent with this model, synaptic transmission at the IHC ribbon synapse is largely unaffected in sirtaki mice that carry a C-terminal deletion mutation in Pjvk. Using the C-terminal domain of pejvakin as bait, we identified in a cochlear cDNA library ROCK2, an effector for the small GTPase Rho, and the scaffold protein IQGAP1, involved in modulating actin dynamics. Both ROCK2 and IQGAP1 associate via their coiled-coil domains with pejvakin. We conclude that pejvakin is required to sustain OHC activity and survival in a cell-autonomous manner likely involving regulation of Rho signaling.

AB  - Abstract
Neuroplasticity has been subject to a great deal of research in the last century. Recently, significant emphasis has been placed on the global effect of localized plastic changes throughout the central nervous system, and on how these changes integrate in a pathological context. Specifically, alterations of network functionality have been described in various pathological contexts to which corresponding structural alterations have been proposed. However, considering the amount of literature and the different pathological contexts, an integration of this information is still lacking. In this paper we will review the concepts of neural plasticity as well as their repercussions on network remodeling and provide a possible explanation to how these two concepts relate to each other. We will further examine how alterations in different pathological contexts may relate to each other and will discuss the concept of plasticity diseases, its models and implications.

AB  - Abstract
Previous studies have indicated that presynaptic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptors (AMPARs) contribute to the regulation of neurotransmitter release. In hippocampal synapses, the presynaptic surface expression of several AMPAR subunits, including GluA2, is regulated in a ligand-dependent manner. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the presynaptic trafficking of AMPARs are still unknown. Here, using bright-field immunocytochemistry, western blots, and quantitative immunogold electron microscopy of the hippocampal CA1 area from intact adult rat brain, we demonstrate the association of AMPA receptors with the presynaptic active zone and with small presynaptic vesicles, in Schaffer collateral synapses in CA1 of the hippocampus. Furthermore, we show that GluA2 and protein interacting with C kinase 1 (PICK1) are colocalized at presynaptic vesicles. Similar to postsynaptic mechanisms, overexpression of either PICK1 or pep2m, which inhibit the N-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion protein (NSF)-GluA2 interaction, decreases the concentration of GluA2 in the presynaptic active zone membrane. These data suggest that the interacting proteins PICK1 and NSF act as regulators of presynaptic GluA2-containing AMPAR trafficking between the active zone and a vesicle pool that may provide the basis of presynaptic components of synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Abstract
In the mouse, odorant receptor proteins (ORs) are G-protein-coupled receptors expressed in mature olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) of the main olfactory epithelium (MOE). ORs mediate odorant reception at the level of the OSN cilia. Most of the ∼1100 OR genes in the mouse genome are expressed, at the RNA level, in mature OSNs. The literature on antibodies against ORs is limited, and most reports are with antibodies that are not commercially available. Here we have screened 40 commercial antibodies against human and mouse ORs by immunofluorescence staining of coronal cryosections of the MOE of 21-day-old C57BL/6J mice. Various methods of antigen retrieval were tested. Of the 19 antibodies raised against human ORs, three yielded a consistent immunoreactive signal in the mouse MOE; of these three, two appeared to cross react against one or more, unknown, mouse ORs. Of the 21 antibodies raised against mouse ORs, six yielded a consistent immunoreactive signal in the mouse MOE; of these six, two also stained specific glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Antibody specificity could be validated with gene-targeted mouse strains in the case of three ORs. The number of OSNs immunoreactive for the MOR28/Olfr1507 antibody is greater in C57BL/6J than in 129S6/SvEvTac wild-type mice. Taken together, our results are encouraging: 20–30% of these commercially available antibodies are informative in immunohistochemical analyses of the mouse MOE. The commercial availability of these antibodies should facilitate the study of OR proteins in the MOE and the olfactory bulb, and the replicability of results in the literature.

AB  - Abstract
Central sensitization is a key mechanism in the pathology of several neuropathic pain disorders. We aimed to investigate the underlying brain connectivity changes in a rat model of chronic pain.

Non-noxious whisker stimulation was used to evoke blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses in a block-design functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) experiment on 9.4 T. Measurements were repeated two days and one week after injecting complete Freund’s adjuvant into the rats’ whisker pad.

We found that acute pain reduced activation in the barrel cortex, most probably due to a plateau effect. After one week, increased activation of the anterior cingulate cortex was found. Analyses of effective connectivity driven by stimulus-related activation revealed that chronic pain-related central sensitization manifested as a widespread alteration in the activity of the somatosensory network. Changes were mainly mediated by the anterior cingulate cortex and the striatum and affected the somatosensory and motor cortices and the superior colliculus. Functional connectivity analysis of nested BOLD oscillations justified that the anterior cingular–somatosensory interplay is a key element of network changes. Additionally, a decreased cingulo-motor functional connectivity implies that alterations also involve the output tract of the network.

Our results extend the knowledge about the role of the cingulate cortex in the chronification of pain and indicate that integration of multiple connectivity analysis could be fruitful in studying the central sensitization in the pain matrix.

AB  - Abstract
Antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs are widely consumed even by pregnant and lactating women. The metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP) exerts antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like actions. Given that treatment for anxiety and depression use to be prolonged in time, it is conceivable a possible modulation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu receptors) after prolonged MPEP exposure, which could also modify adenosine A2A receptors (A2AR) since functional cross-talk between them has been reported. Here we report that MPEP crosses placental barrier and reaches neonatal brain through maternal milk using LC–MS/MS methods. Therefore, we analyzed mGlu receptors, mainly mGlu5, and A2AR in both maternal and fetal brain after chronic maternal consumption of MPEP during gestation and/or lactation using radioligand binding, Western-blotting, real-time PCR and phospholipase C (PLC) activity assays. In maternal brain, chronic MPEP consumption caused a significant loss of mGlu, including mGlu5, and A2AR receptors level in plasma membrane. PLC activity assays showed that mGlu5 signaling pathway was desensitized. No variations on mRNA level coding A2AR, A1R and mGlu5 were found after MPEP treatments. In female neonatal brain, maternal consumption of MPEP caused a significant increase in mGlu, including mGlu5, and A2AR receptors level. Neither mGlu receptors nor A2AR were modified in male neonatal brain after maternal MPEP intake. Finally, neither molecular nor behavioral changes (anxiety- and depression-like behavior) were observed in 3-month-old female offspring. In summary, mGlu5 and A2AR are altered in both maternal and female neonatal brain after chronic maternal consumption of MPEP during gestation and/or lactation.

AB  - Abstract
Nitric oxide donors are known to produce headache in healthy as well as migraine subjects, and to induce extracephalic cutaneous hypersensitivity in rodents. However, little is known on the effect of nitric oxide donors on cephalic cutaneous sensitivity. Combining behavioral, immunohistochemical, and in vivo electrophysiological approaches, this study investigated the effect of systemic administration of the nitric oxide donor, isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN), on cephalic and extracephalic cutaneous sensitivity and on neuronal activation within the medullary dorsal horn (MDH) in the rat. Systemic administration of ISDN increased selectively the first phase and interphase of the facial formalin test, but had no effect on the hindpaw formalin one. Monitoring neuronal activity within the MDH with phospho-ERK1/2 immunoreactivity revealed that ISDN alone did not activate MDH neurons, but significantly increased the number of formalin-evoked phospho-ERK1/2-immunoreactive cells in the ipsilateral, but not contralateral, MDH. Using in vivo electrophysiological unit recordings, we show that ISDN administration never affected the spontaneous activity of trigeminal wide dynamic range neurons, but, facilitated C-fiber-evoked responses in half the neurons tested. This research demonstrates that a nitric oxide donor, isosorbide dinitrate, induces selectively cephalic hyperalgesia that arises as a consequence of central sensitization in pain pathways that subserve meningeal nociception. This model better mimics the clinical condition and offers another possibility of studying the role of nitric oxide donor in the physiopathology of headache.

AB  - Abstract
About 7.5 million adults in Germany cannot read and write properly despite attending school for several years. They are considered to be functional illiterates. Since the ability to read and write is crucial for being employed and socially accepted, we developed a literacy training to overcome these deficits. In this study, we investigate the structural changes induced by the training.

A group of 20 functional illiterates and 20 adult normal readers participated in the study. Group differences as well as intervention-related changes in gray (voxel-based morphometry, VBM) and white matter (Tract-Based Spatial Statistics, TBSS, applied to fractional anisotropy, FA, obtained with diffusion tensor imaging, DTI) were assessed in functional illiterates and normal reading controls.

VBM analyses revealed decreased gray matter intensities in functional illiterates compared to normal readers before training in several reading-related brain regions such as the superior temporal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, and angular gyrus. Using TBSS, functional illiterates showed reduced FA values in the genu of the corpus callosum. After training, both the gray matter intensities and FA values increased in functional illiterates and were no longer statistically different from controls’ pre-test data. Moreover, the increase was positively correlated with reading and writing skills.

The findings suggest that poor literacy skills are associated with several structural abnormalities in reading-related brain areas. In addition, we showed that while literacy skills of functional illiterates improved after training, the structural differences to controls disappeared.

AB  - Abstract
Transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) subfamily of cationic channels have emerged as novel players in neural regulation. Unlike other members of TRPV subfamily, TRPV5 and TRPV6 are highly Ca2+-selective. Although TRPV5/TRPV6 transcripts are expressed in mouse brain, understanding the full functional spectrum of these ion channels in the brain is however limited due to the lack of information on their neuroanatomical distribution. We have studied TRPV6 in mouse brain in further detail. In the hypothalamus, while Western blot analysis using TRPV6 specific antiserum showed a distinct ∼95 kDa band corresponding to the molecular weight of TRPV6, transcripts for TRPV6 were detected with RT-PCR. TRPV6-immunoreactive cells/fibers were observed in vascular organ of the lamina terminalis, olfactory bulb, amygdala, hippocampus, septohypothalamic, supraoptic, arcuate (ARC), dorsomedial, and subincertal nuclei. TRPV6-immunoreactive cells/fibers were also observed in the brainstem and cerebellum. Estrogen has emerged as a potential regulator of TRPV6 in peripheral tissues. TRPV6 gene promoter contains estrogen-response element, estrogen activates TRPV6 via estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), and ERα-expressing ARC neurons in mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) serve as primary site for estradiol feedback. Using double immunofluorescence, co-expression of TRPV6 and ERα was observed in several ARC neurons. MBH of mice during different phases of estrous cycle were subjected to Western blot analysis of TRPV6. Compared to proestrus, a significant reduction (P &lt; 0.01) in intensity of TRPV6-immunoreactive band was observed in MBH during metestrus and diestrus phases. While the wide distribution of TRPV6-expressing elements in the brain suggests its role in a range of CNS functions, the ion channel may serve as novel component of the neural pathway mediating effects of estradiol in MBH.

AB  - Abstract
Egocentric vs. allocentric perspective during observation of hand movements has been related to self-other differentiation such that movements observed from an egocentric viewpoint have been considered as self-related while movements observed from an allocentric viewpoint have been considered as belonging to someone else. Correlational studies have generally found that egocentric perspective induces greater neurophysiological responses and larger behavioral effects compared to an allocentric perspective. However, recent studies question previous findings by reporting greater (μ) suppression and greater transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) during observation of allocentric compared to egocentric movements. Furthermore, self-other differentiation has been generally related to activity within the inferior parietal lobe (IPL), but direct evidence for a causal and functional role of IPL in self-other differentiation is lacking. The current study was therefore designed to investigate the influence that IPL exerts on self-other differentiation. To this aim, we measured the impact of individually adjusted alpha-tuned transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) applied over IPL on μ-suppression during hands movement observation from an egocentric and allocentric perspective. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded during movement observation before and immediately after tACS. Results demonstrated that tACS decreased μ-reactivity over sensorimotor (but not visual) regions for egocentric (but not allocentric) movement observation providing direct evidence for a causal involvement of IPL in the observation of self- but not other-related hand movement.

Structural connectome measurement combined with diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and tractography allows generation of a whole-brain connectome. However, current cortical structural connectivity (SC) measurements have not been well combined with the vertex-wise multi-subjects statistical analysis. The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of using group comparison vertex-wise analysis for cortical SC measurement. A fiber connectivity density (FiCD) method based on a combination of a diffusion fiber tracking technique and cortical surface-based analysis was used to measure the whole-brain cortical SC map (FiCD map). A public MRI dataset (GigaDB) was employed to evaluate the reproducibility of the FiCD method. For group comparison, 14 post-stroke patients (mean age, 68.36 ± 7.33 y) and 19 healthy participants (mean age, 66.84 ± 8.58 y) had FiCD measurement. The intergroup comparison of the FiCD map was performed using vertex-wise multi-subject statistical analysis. Reliability testing showed the mean intra- and inter-subject FiCD variability was 3.51 ± 2.12% and 19.44 ± 4.79%, respectively. The group comparison of the whole-brain FiCD identified cortical regions with altered FiCD values, and there was a spatial consistency between the cortical clusters with low FiCD values and the subcortical lesions of patients. This study demonstrated the feasibility of vertex-wise group comparison for evaluating cortical fiber connectivity density. The FiCD method has good intra- and inter-individual reproducibility, and accurately reflects the affected cortical regions in post-stroke patients. This method may be helpful for neuroscience research.

AB  - Abstract
Tunicamycin (TM) induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and inhibits N-glycosylation in cells. ER stress is associated with neuronal death in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, and most patients complain of the impairment of olfactory recognition. Here we examined the effects of TM on aversive olfactory learning and the underlying synaptic plasticity in the main olfactory bulb (MOB). Behavioral experiments demonstrated that the intrabulbar infusion of TM disabled aversive olfactory learning without affecting short-term memory. Histological analyses revealed that TM infusion upregulated C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), a marker of ER stress, in the mitral and granule cell layers of MOB. Electrophysiological data indicated that TM inhibited tetanus-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) at the dendrodendritic excitatory synapse from mitral to granule cells. A low dose of TM (250 nM) abolished the late phase of LTP, and a high dose (1 μM) inhibited the early and late phases of LTP. Further, high-dose, but not low-dose, TM reduced the paired-pulse facilitation ratio, suggesting that the inhibitory effects of TM on LTP are partially mediated through the presynaptic machinery. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that TM-induced ER stress impairs olfactory learning by inhibiting synaptic plasticity via presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms in MOB.

Cysteine protease Cathepsin S (CatS) expressed by spinal microglia has been shown to play a critical role in nerve injury and inflammation-induced chronic pain. However, whether microglial CatS contributes to remifentanil-induced acute hyperalgesia remains unstudied. In the present study, intravenous remifentanil infusion induced a significant increase in the expression of premature and mature form of CatS in the activated microglia in the spinal cord. Spinal delivery of irreversible CatS inhibitor LHVS reduced hyperalgesia, attenuated activation of spinal microglia and blocked phosphorylation of NMDA receptor NR1 subunit induced by remifentanil. Furthermore, inhibition of microglia by minocycline effectively suppressed remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia, as well as CatS upregulation. In addition, remifentanil infusion also induced an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in spinal neurons. Systemic administration of ROS scavenger PBN was sufficient to suppress remifentanil-induced painful hypersensitivity. Removal of ROS by PBN prevented upregulation of mature CatS in spinal microglia. However, increased protein level of premature form of CatS was not affected by PBN. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that neuronal ROS promote maturation of microglial CatS which facilitates activation of NMDA in the spinal dorsal horn. Therefore, such mechanism is involved in neuron-microglia positive feedback and contributes to remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia.

AB  - Abstract
Ketamine and other noncompetitive N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists are known to induce deficits in learning and cognitive performance sensitive to prefrontal cortex (PFC) functions. The interaction of a glutamatergic and GABAergic systems is essential for many cognitive behaviors. In order to understand the effect of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/glutamate interactions on learning and memory, we investigated the effects of intra medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) injections of GABAergic agents on ketamine-induced amnesia using a one-trial passive avoidance task in mice. Pre-training systemic administration of ketamine (5, 10 and 15 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently decreased the memory acquisition of a one-trial passive avoidance task. Pre-training intra-mPFC injection of muscimol, GABAA receptor agonist (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 μg/mouse) and baclofen GABAB receptor agonist (0.05, 0.1, 0.5 and 1 μg/mouse), impaired memory acquisition. However, co-pretreatment of different doses of muscimol and baclofen with a lower dose of ketamine (5 mg/kg), which did not induce amnesia by itself, caused inhibition of memory formation. Our data showed that sole pre-training administration of bicuculline, GABA-A receptor antagonist and phaclofen GABA-B receptor antagonist into the mPFC, did not affect memory acquisition. In addition, the amnesia induced by pre-training ketamine (15 mg/kg) was significantly decreased by the pretreatment of bicuculline (0.005, 0.1 and 0.5 μg/mouse). It can be concluded that GABAergic system of the mPFC is involved in the ketamine-induced impairment of memory acquisition.

AB  - Abstract
Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) often complain of neuropathic pain. According to the Gate Control Theory of Pain, spinal networks of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons are important in modulating nociceptive inputs from the periphery. Na+–K+–2Cl− co-transporter 1 (NKCC1) and K+–Cl− co-transporter 2 (KCC2) generally dictate the tone of GABA/glycine inhibition by regulating intracellular chloride concentrations. In this study, we investigated the role of NKCC1 and KCC2 in neuropathic pain observed in the animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a commonly used model to study the pathophysiology of MS. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed no change in NKCC1 mRNA transcripts in dorsal root ganglia throughout EAE disease course. However, NKCC1 and KCC2 mRNA levels in the dorsal spinal cord were significantly reduced at disease onset and peak only to recover by the chronic time point. Similarly, Western blot data revealed a significant downregulation of NKCC1 and KCC2 in the dorsal spinal cord at disease onset but an upregulation of NKCC1 protein in the dorsal root ganglia at this time point. Treatment with bumetanide, an NKCC inhibitor, had no effect on mechanical hypersensitivity seen in mice with EAE even though it reversed the changes in the levels of NKCC1 and KCC2. We noted that bumetanide treatment, while effective at reversing the changes in monomeric KCC2 levels was ineffective at reversing the changes in oligomeric KCC2 which remained repressed. These results indicate that mechanical hypersensitivity in EAE is not mediated by altered levels of NKCC1.

AB  - Abstract
Amongst the side effects of triptans, a substantial percentage of patients experience injection site pain and tenderness, the underlying mechanism of which is unknown. We found that the dose range from 10 fg to 1000 ng (intradermal) of sumatriptan induced a complex dose-dependent mechanical hyperalgesia in male rats, with distinct peaks, at 1 pg and 10 ng, but no hyperalgesia at 1 ng. In contrast, in females, there was 1 broad peak. The highest dose (1000 ng) did not produce hyperalgesia in either sex. We evaluated the receptors mediating sumatriptan hyperalgesia (1 pg, 1 and 10 ng). In males, the injection of an antagonist for the serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtype 1B (5-HT1B), but not 5-HT1D, markedly inhibited sumatriptan (1 pg)-induced hyperalgesia, at 10 ng a 5-HT1D receptor antagonist completely eliminated hyperalgesia. In contrast, in females, the 5-HT1D, but not 5-HT1B, receptor antagonist completely blocked sumatriptan (1 pg and 10 ng) hyperalgesia and both 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor antagonists attenuated hyperalgesia (1 ng) in females, which is GPR30 estrogen receptor dependent. While selective 5-HT1D or 5-HT1B, agonists produce robust hyperalgesia in female and male rats, respectively, when co-injected the hyperalgesia induced in both sexes was attenuated. Mechanical hyperalgesia induced by sumatriptan (1 pg and 10 ng) is dependent on the G-protein αi subunit and protein kinase A (PKA), in IB4-positive and negative nociceptors. Understanding the mechanisms responsible for the complex dose dependence for triptan hyperalgesia may provide useful information for the design of anti-migraine drugs with improved therapeutic profiles.

AB  - Abstract
The high prevalence of chronic pain in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) individuals has been widely reported by clinical studies, which emphasized an urgent need to uncover the underlying mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets. Recent studies suggested that targeting activated glia and their pro-inflammatory products may provide a novel and effective therapy for the stress-related pain. In this study, we investigated whether activation of alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7 nAChR), a novel anti-inflammatory target, could attenuate PTSD-related chronic pain. The experiments were conducted in a rat model of single prolonged stress (SPS), an established model of PTSD-pain comorbidity. We found that SPS exposure produced persistent mechanical allodynia. Immunohistochemical and enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay analysis showed that SPS also induced elevated activation of glia cells (including microglia and astrocytes) and accumulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in spinal cord. In another experiment, we found that intrathecal injection of PHA-543613, a selective α7 nAchR agonist, attenuated the SPS-evoked allodynia in a dose dependent manner. However, this anti-hyperalgesic effect was blocked by pretreatment with methyllycaconitine (MLA), a selective α7 nAchR antagonist. Further analyses showed that PHA-543613 suppressed SPS-induced spinal glial activation and SPS-elevated spinal pro-inflammatory cytokines, and these were abolished by MLA. Taken together, the present study showed that spinal activation of α7 nAChR by PHA-543613 attenuated mechanical allodynia induced by PTSD-like stress, and the suppression of spinal glial activation may underlie this anti-hyperalgesic effect. Our study demonstrated the therapeutic potential of targeting α7 nAChR in the treatment of PTSD-related chronic pain.

AB  - Abstract
Although patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) often exhibit hypertension, the mechanisms responsible for this correlation are not well known. We hypothesized that the bulbospinal neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) are affected by the levels of glucose, insulin, or incretins (glucagon like peptide-1 [GLP-1] or glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide [GIP]) in patients with DM. To investigate whether RVLM neurons are activated by glucose, insulin, GLP-1, or GIP, we examined changes in the membrane potentials of bulbospinal RVLM neurons using whole-cell patch-clamp technique during superfusion with various levels of glucose or these hormones in neonatal Wistar rats. A brainstem–spinal cord preparation was used for the experiments. A low level of glucose stimulated bulbospinal RVLM neurons. During insulin superfusion, almost all the RVLM neurons were depolarized, while during GLP-1 or GIP superfusion, almost all the RVLM neurons were hyperpolarized. Next, histological examinations were performed to examine transporters for glucose and receptors for insulin, GLP-1, and GIP on RVLM neurons. Low-level glucose-depolarized RVLM neurons exhibited the presence of glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3). Meanwhile, insulin-depolarized, GLP-1-hyperpolarized, and GIP-hyperpolarized RVLM neurons showed each of the respective specific receptor. These results indicate that a low level of glucose stimulates bulbospinal RVLM neurons via specific transporters on these neurons, inducing hypertension. Furthermore, an increase in insulin or a reduction in incretins may also activate the sympathetic nervous system and induce hypertension by activating RVLM neurons via their own receptors.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is associated with various ischemic cerebrovascular diseases that are characterized by cognitive impairment. The role of autophagy in cognitive dysfunction under conditions of CCH is poorly understood. To address this issue, the present study investigated the effect of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor URB597 on autophagy and cognition in a CCH model as well as the underlying mechanisms. Cognitive function was evaluated with the Morris water maze and by assessing long-term potentiation (LTP). The expression of autophagy-related proteins and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway components was evaluated by immunofluorescence and western blot analyses, and ultrastructural changes were examined by transmission electron microscopy (EM). URB597 improved cognitive impairment by inhibiting CCH-induced autophagy, which was associated with mTOR signaling. Moreover, the ultrastructural deterioration resulting from CCH was improved by chronic treatment with URB597. These findings indicate that URB597 modulates autophagy in an mTOR-dependent manner, and mitigates neuronal damage and cognitive deterioration caused by CCH.

AB  - Abstract
Serotonin (5-HT) neurons contribute to respiratory chemoreception in adult mice, but it is unclear whether they play a similar role in neonatal mice. We studied breathing during development in Lmx1bf/f/p mice, which lack 5-HT neurons. From postnatal days 1–7 (P1–P7), ventilation of Lmx1bf/f/p mice breathing room air was 50% of WT mice (p &lt; 0.001). By P12, baseline ventilation increased to a level equal to WT mice. In contrast, the hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR) of neonatal Lmx1bf/f/p and WT mice was equal to each other, but were both much less than adult WT mice. By P21 the HCVR of WT mice increased to near adult levels, but the HCVR of Lmx1bf/f/p mice had not changed, and was 42% less than WT mice. Primary cell cultures were prepared from the ventromedial medulla of neonatal mice, and patch-clamp recordings were made from neurons identified as serotonergic by expression of a reporter gene. In parallel with developmental changes of the HCVR in vivo, 5-HT neurons had little chemosensitivity to acidosis until 12 days in vitro (DIV), after which their response increased to reach a plateau around 25 DIV. Neonatal Lmx1bf/f/p mice displayed high mortality and decreased growth rate, and this worsened in hypoxia. Mortality was decreased in hyperoxia. These results indicate that maturation of 5-HT neurons contributes to development of respiratory CO2/pH chemoreception during the first few weeks of life in mice in vivo. A defect in the 5-HT system in early postnatal life decreases survival due in part to hypoxia.

AB  - Abstract
Glutamate transporters (EAAT) have been implicated in the drug addiction behavior. We determined whether EAAT type 3 (EAAT3) played a role in morphine addiction. Six- to eight-week-old EAAT3 knockout (EAAT3−/−) mice and their wild-type littermates received 3 intraperitoneal injections of 10 mg/kg morphine, each on an alternative day, to induce conditioned place preference (CPP). Two days after the place preference returned to baseline, mice received 2.5 mg/kg morphine to induce reinstatement. Some mice received intraperitoneal injection of 4 mg/kg riluzole, an EAAT activator, 30 min before morphine or saline injection. Hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area were harvested for Western analysis 24 h after the last dose of morphine was injected. Morphine induced CPP in wild-type and EAAT3−/− mice. Gender is not a statistically significant factor to influence this behavior. This conditioned behavior extinguished after morphine administration was stopped for 8–9 days in wild-type mice, while this extinction occurred 6 days after discontinuation of morphine injection in EAAT3−/− mice. A small dose of morphine similarly reinstated the conditioned behavior in the wild-type and EAAT3−/− mice. Riluzole abolished morphine-induced CPP during the initial place preference. Morphine increased EAAT3 expression in the plasma membrane of medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area but did not affect EAAT3 expression in the hippocampus. These results suggest that EAAT3 delays the extinction of morphine-induced CPP. EAAT activation may prevent the formation of morphine-induced CPP.

AB  - Abstract
RAB-GDP dissociation inhibitor 1 (GDI1) loss-of-function mutations are responsible for a form of non-specific X-linked Intellectual Disability (XLID) where the only clinical feature is cognitive impairment. GDI1 patients are impaired in specific aspects of executive functions and conditioned response, which are controlled by fronto-striatal circuitries. Previous molecular and behavioral characterization of the Gdi1-null mouse revealed alterations in the total number/distribution of hippocampal and cortical synaptic vesicles as well as hippocampal short-term synaptic plasticity, and memory deficits. In this study, we employed cognitive protocols with high translational validity to human condition that target the functionality of cortico-striatal circuitry such as attention and stimulus selection ability with progressive degree of complexity. We previously showed that Gdi1-null mice are impaired in some hippocampus-dependent forms of associative learning assessed by aversive procedures. Here, using appetitive-conditioning procedures we further investigated associative learning deficits sustained by the fronto-striatal system.

We report that Gdi1-null mice are impaired in attention and associative learning processes, which are a key part of the cognitive impairment observed in XLID patients.

AB  - Abstract
It was postulated that neuropeptide Y (NPY)-ergic system could be involved in the ischemic pathophysiology, however, the role of particular subtypes of NPY receptors (YRs) in neuroprotection against ischemia is still not well known. Therefore, we investigated the effect of NPY and YR ligands using in vitro and in vivo experimental ischemic stroke models. Our in vitro findings showed that NPY (0.5–1 μM) and specific agonists of Y2R (0.1–1 μM) and Y5R (0.5–1 μM) but not that of Y1R produced neuroprotective effects against oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced neuronal cell death, being also effective when given 30 min after the end of OGD. The neuroprotective effects of Y2R and Y5R agonists were reversed by appropriate antagonists. Neuroprotection mediated by NPY, Y2R and Y5R agonists was accompanied by the inhibition of both OGD-induced calpain activation and glutamate release. Data from in vivo studies demonstrated that Y2R agonist (10 μg/6 μl; i.c.v.) not only diminished the infarct volume in rats subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) but also improved selected gait parameters in CatWalk behavioral test, being also effective after delayed treatment. Moreover, we found that a Y5R agonist (10 μg/6 μl; i.c.v.) did not reduce MCAO-evoked brain damage but improved stride length, when it was given 30 min after starting the occlusion. In conclusion, our studies indicate that Y5 and especially Y2 receptors may be promising targets for neuroprotection against ischemic damage.

AB  - Abstract
β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition is considered partially responsible for cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recently, resveratrol has been reported to play a potential role as a neuroprotective biofactor by modulating Aβ pathomechanisms, including through anti-neuronal apoptotic, anti-oxidative stress, and anti-neuroinflammatory effects. In addition, SIRT1 has been demonstrated to modulate learning and memory function by regulating the expression of cAMP response binding protein (CREB), which involves in modulating the expression of SIRT1. However, whether resveratrol can alleviate Aβ-induced cognitive dysfunction, whether SIRT1 expression and CREB phosphorylation in the hippocampus are affected by Aβ, and whether resveratrol influences these effects remain unknown. In the present study, we used a hippocampal injection model in rats to investigate the effects of resveratrol on Aβ1–42-induced impairment of spatial learning, memory and synaptic plasticity as well as on alterations of SIRT1 expression and CREB phosphorylation. We found that resveratrol significantly reversed the water maze behavioral impairment and the attenuation of long-term potentiation (LTP) in area CA1 that were induced by hippocampal injection of Aβ1–42. Interestingly, resveratrol also prevented the Aβ1–42-induced reductions in SIRT1 expression and CREB phosphorylation in rat hippocampus. In conclusion, in rats, resveratrol protects neurons against Aβ1–42-induced disruption of spatial learning, memory and hippocampal LTP. The mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects may involve rescue of SIRT1 expression and CREB phosphorylation.

AB  - Abstract
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease in which more than 70% of patients experience visual disturbance as the earliest symptoms. Lysolecithin (LPC)-induced focal demyelination model has been developed to evaluate the effects of different therapies on myelin repair improvement. In this study, the effects of pregabalin administration on myelin repair and glial activation were investigated. Local demyelination was induced by administration of LPC (1%, 2 μL) into the rat optic chiasm. Rats underwent daily injection of pregabalin (30 mg/kg, i.p) or vehicle. Visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) recordings were performed for evaluating the function of optic pathway on days 3, 7, 14 and 28 post lesions. Myelin specific staining and immunostaining against GFAP and Iba1 were also carried out for assessment of myelination and glial activation respectively. Electrophysiological data indicated that pregabalin administration could significantly reduce the P1-N1 latency and increase the amplitude of VEPs waves compared to saline group. Luxol fast blue staining and immunostaining against PLP, as mature myelin marker, showed that myelin repair was improved in animals received pregabalin treatment. In addition, pregabalin effectively reduced the expression of GFAP and Iba1 as activated glial markers in optic chiasm. The present study indicates that pregabalin administration enhances myelin repair and ameliorates glial activation of optic chiasm following local injection of LPC.

AB  - Abstract
The firing pattern of individual neurons is an important element for information processing and storing. During the first weeks of development, there is a transitional period during which CA1 pyramidal neurons display burst-spiking behavior in contrast to the adult regular-firing pattern. Spike after-depolarizations (ADPs) constitute a major factor underlying burst-spiking behavior. Using current-clamp recordings, we studied ADP waveforms and firing patterns in CA1 pyramidal neurons of Wistar rats from 9 to 19 postnatal days (P9–19). The percentage of burst-spiking neurons increased up to P16, in correlation with the emergence of an active component in the ADP. The application of low-voltage-activated (LVA) calcium channel blockers such as nickel or mibefradil suppressed the generation of the active ADP component and burst-spiking behavior. In agreement with the development of the ADP waveform and burst-spiking behavior, voltage-clamp experiments in dissociated pyramidal neurons showed an increase in the LVA calcium current in P16–19 vs P9–12. Finally, we found that a reduction of extracellular calcium levels decreases the percentage of burst-spiking cells due to a reduction in the active component of the ADP. We conclude that a major contribution of LVA calcium channels to ADP determines the bursting capability of CA1 pyramidal neurons during a transitional postnatal period in contrast to adulthood.

Despite the important role of glutamate as a neurotransmitter, elevated extracellular glutamate can result in excitotoxicity and apoptosis. Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a naturally occurring sodium salt of glutamic acid that is used as a flavor enhancer in many processed foods. Previous studies have shown that MSG administration during the early postnatal period results in neurodegenerative changes in several forebrain regions, characterized by neuronal loss and neuroendocrine abnormalities. Systemic delivery of MSG during the neonatal period and induction of glutamate neurotoxicity in the cochlea have both been shown to result in fewer neurons in the spiral ganglion. We hypothesized that an MSG-induced loss of neurons in the spiral ganglion would have a significant impact on the number of neurons in the cochlear nuclei and superior olivary complex (SOC). Indeed, we found that exposure to MSG from postnatal days 4 through 10 resulted in significantly fewer neurons in the cochlear nuclei and SOC and significant dysmorphology in surviving neurons. Moreover, we found that neonatal MSG exposure resulted in a significant decrease in the expression of both calretinin and calbindin. These results suggest that neonatal exposure to MSG interferes with early development of the auditory brainstem and impacts expression of calcium binding proteins, both of which may lead to diminished auditory function.

AB  - Abstract
Patients with dysphagia can have higher risks of aspiration after repetitive swallowing activity due to the “fatigue effect”. However, it is still unknown how consecutive swallows affect brain activity. Therefore, we sought to investigate differences in swallowing brain networks formed during consecutive swallows using a signal processing on graph approach. Data were collected from 55 healthy people using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Participants performed dry swallows (i.e., saliva swallows) and wet swallows (i.e., water, nectar-thick, and honey thick swallows). After standard pre-processing of the EEG time series, brain networks were formed using the time–frequency-based synchrony measure, while signals on graphs were formed as a line graph of the brain networks. For calculating the vertex frequency information from the signals on graphs, the proposed algorithm was based on the optimized window size for calculating the windowed graph Fourier transform and the graph S-transform. The proposed algorithms were tested using synthetic signals and showed improved energy concentration in comparison to the original algorithm. When applied to EEG swallowing data, the optimized windowed graph Fourier transform and the optimized graph S-transform showed that differences exist in brain activity between consecutive swallows. In addition, the results showed higher differences between consecutive swallows for thicker liquids.

AB  - Abstract
Exposure to stress early in life may negatively impact nervous system functioning, including increasing the proneness to learning and memory impairments later in life. Maternal deprivation, a model of early-life stress, hinders memory in adult rats and lessens brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the hippocampus in a very heterogeneous way among individuals. The main goal of the present study was to investigate the possible epigenetic modulation underlying recognition memory impairment and reduced BDNF levels in the hippocampus of adult maternally deprived rats. We also evaluated the potential ameliorating properties of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, sodium butyrate, on memory deficits and BDNF changes related to maternal deprivation. Maternally deprived animals were categorized as ‘inferior learners’ and ‘superior learners’ according to their performance in object recognition memory task in comparison to controls. Results indicated that HDAC activity was higher in individuals submitted to maternal deprivation with the worst cognitive performance (inferior learners). Acute administration of sodium butyrate increased histone H3 acetylation and BDNF levels, and restored recognition memory in maternally deprived animals with the worst cognitive performance. Moreover, we also showed that there is a positive correlation between BDNF levels and memory performance. Taken together, the results indicated that HDAC inhibitors could be considered as a possible therapeutic agent to improve cognitive performance in inferior learners. Further studies need to be conducted for a better comprehension of the mechanisms related to persistent alterations observed in adult life induced by early stressful circumstances and those leading to resilience.

AB  - Abstract
Human Albumin is a unique pleiotropic protein with multiple properties. Previous clinical and laboratory studies have indicated a possible beneficial effect of Albumin in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The present study aimed to further define the preclinical characteristics of Albumin. SAH was induced by endovascular perforation in Sprague–Dawley rats. In the dose-escalation study, Albumin ranging from 0.02 g/kg to 1.0 g/kg was intravenously infused immediately after SAH. In the therapeutic window study, 1.0 g/kg Albumin was administered at 0 h, 2 h, 4 h or 8 h after SAH. Physiologic variables were monitored in different Albumin treatment regimens. One day after SAH, neurological scores, SAH scores, blood–brain barrier permeability, neural degeneration and apoptosis were examined. The efficacy of Albumin for SAH was also determined in female rats and in spontaneously hypertensive rats. We found that 0.2 g/kg and 1.0 g/kg Albumin significantly attenuated sensorimotor deficits, brain edema, IgG leakage, and neuronal degeneration after SAH. The benefits of Albumin existed even when the administration was delayed to 4 h after SAH onset. No significant difference was found between 0.2 g/kg and 1.0 g/kg Albumin groups. In female rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats, Albumin likewise improved neurological outcomes and early brain injury. In conclusion, Albumin could reduce both cerebral lesions and functional deficits in the early stage of SAH. The beneficial regimen occurs within a favorable therapeutic window and is reproducible in different high-risk subjects.

AB  - Abstract
Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2) from enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) causes bloody diarrhea and Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) that may derive to fatal neurological outcomes. Neurological abnormalities in the striatum are frequently observed in affected patients and in studies with animal models while motor disorders are usually associated with pyramidal and extra pyramidal systems.

A translational murine model of encephalopathy was employed to demonstrate that systemic administration of a sublethal dose of Stx2 damaged the striatal microvasculature and astrocytes, increase the blood brain barrier permeability and caused neuronal degeneration. All these events were aggravated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The injury observed in the striatum coincided with locomotor behavioral alterations. The anti-inflammatory Dexamethasone resulted to prevent the observed neurologic and clinical signs, proving to be an effective drug. Therefore, the present work demonstrates that: (i) systemic sub-lethal Stx2 damages the striatal neurovascular unit as it succeeds to pass through the blood brain barrier. (ii) This damage is aggravated by the contribution of LPS which is also produced and secreted by EHEC, and (iii) the observed neurological alterations may be prevented by an anti-inflammatory treatment.

AB  - Abstract
Decreased proteolytic clearance of soluble amyloid β (Aβ) in microglia affects Aβ accumulation on Alzheimer’s disease progression. However, the potential molecular mechanism by which microglial Aβ uptake is regulated remains unclear. In this study, we identified a microRNA, miR-124, that was down-regulated in aging with a function in regulating apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-dependent Aβ uptake by targeting regulatory factor X1 (RFX1) transcripts on BV2 microglia cell. Decreased expression of miRNA-124 in BV2 cells exposed to mild hydrogen peroxide increased RFX1 protein level and decreased the expression of ApoE, a gene which has been suggested to enhance cellular Aβ uptake in microglia. We also identified a miR-124 binding site in the 3′-UTR of RFX1 mRNA and a RFX1 binding site in the first intron of ApoE gene. Furthermore, interfering this signaling pathway by knocking down RFX1 significantly improved Aβ uptake in BV2 cells. These data demonstrate the mechanism through which decreased miR-124 expression under oxidative stress slowed Aβ uptake and suggest that RFX1 might be a target for improving Aβ clearance during aging.

AB  - Abstract
Age-related declines in long- and short-term memory show relationships to decreases in N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor expression, which may involve inflammation. This study was designed to determine effects of an anti-inflammatory drug, ibuprofen, on cognitive function and NMDA receptor expression across aging. Male C57BL/6 mice (ages 5, 14, 20, and 26 months) were fed ibuprofen (375 ppm) in NIH31 diet or diet alone for 6 weeks prior to testing. Behavioral testing using the Morris water maze showed that older mice performed significantly worse than younger in spatial long-term memory, reversal, and short-term memory tasks. Ibuprofen enhanced overall performance in the short-term memory task, but this appeared to be more related to improved executive function than memory. Ibuprofen induced significant decreases over all ages in the mRNA densities for GluN2B subunit, all GluN1 splice variants, and GluN1-1 splice forms in the frontal cortex and in protein expression of GluN2A, GluN2B and GluN1 C2′ cassettes in the hippocampus. GluN1-3 splice form mRNA and C2′ cassette protein were significantly increased across ages in frontal lobes of ibuprofen-treated mice. Ibuprofen did not alter expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNFα, but did reduce the area of reactive astrocyte immunostaining in frontal cortex of aged mice. Enhancement in executive function showed a relationship to increased GluN1-3 mRNA and decreased gliosis. These findings suggest that inflammation may play a role in executive function declines in aged animals, but other effects of ibuprofen on NMDA receptors appeared to be unrelated to aging or inflammation.

AB  - Abstract
Immune activation (IA) during the early neonatal period is a risk factor for the development of schizophrenia. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injected in neonates lead to behavioral and brain changes that persist to adult life. We investigated oxidative stress, levels of cytokines, and the locomotor activity of IA in a schizophrenia animal model in which neonatal male Wistar rats were administered with an injection of LPS (50 μg/kg) on postnatal day 3 and different doses of ketamine (5, 15 and 25 mg/kg) for 7 days during adulthood. Rats LPS-induced did not have locomotor activity alterations. Locomotor activity was elevated in neonatally saline-injected in the higher dose ketamine-treated animals. Carbonyl protein in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus and striatum were increased in the LPS- and saline-induced in the ketamine (25 mg/kg)-treated animals. Lipid damage occurred in the PFC, striatum and hippocampus in the LPS- and saline-induced in the ketamine (15 and 25 mg/kg) -treated animals. In the hippocampus the superoxide dismutase (SOD) was decreased in the LPS- and saline-induced in the ketamine-treated with the dose of 25 mg/kg. In the PFC SOD was reduced in the LPS-induced in the ketamine (25 mg/kg)-treated animals. Catalase in the PFC and hippocampus was reduced in the LPS- and saline-induced in the ketamine (25 mg/kg)-treated animals. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were lower in the brains of LPS-induced in the higher dose ketamine-treated rats. IA influences the locomotor activity and cytokine levels induced by ketamine, and it has a negative effect in potentiating the oxidative stress by higher doses of ketamine in the brain.

AB  - Abstract
Even when performing invariant behavioral task repeatedly on invariant physical stimuli, our behavioral performance always changes as manifested in varying response times (RTs), which is associated with fluctuations in attentional control and thus the underlying self-organization states of the human brain. In a visuospatial task of the present fMRI study, physical stimuli differed across six levels of spatial scope, but were kept invariant within each level. The slower RTs with larger spatial area attended suggested higher demands on visuospatial attention. The slower RTs within each level, however, implicated worse attentional control since both the task and the physical stimuli were kept invariant within each level. The imaging results showed that slower RTs within each of the six levels were associated with higher but later activations in the frontoparietal network, and higher but later deactivations in the default-mode network (DMN). These findings thus for the first time suggested that the within-level variance of attentional control corresponded to dynamic changes in the frontoparietal network and the DMN, in terms of not only the height but also the latency of neural activity. Moreover, although the two networks are anti-correlated in terms of the height of neural activity, they are tightly coupled in terms of the temporal dynamics. Based on the current results, we proposed a tentative hypothesis on the optimal working mode of the frontoparietal attentional control system in the human brain: even a lower height of neural activity in frontoparietal network can significantly improve behavioral performance as long as it starts relatively early.

AB  - Abstract
The molecular sensor of innocuous (painless) cold sensation is well-established to be transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 8 (TRPM8). However, the role of transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily A, member 1 (TRPA1) in noxious (painful) cold sensation has been controversial. We find that TRPA1 channels contribute to the noxious cold sensitivity of mouse somatosensory neurons, independent of TRPM8 channels, and that TRPA1-expressing neurons are largely non-overlapping with TRPM8-expressing neurons in mouse dorsal-root ganglia (DRG). However, relatively few TRPA1-expressing neurons (e.g., responsive to allyl isothiocyanate or AITC, a selective TRPA1 agonist) respond overtly to cold temperature in vitro, unlike TRPM8-expressing neurons, which almost all respond to cold. Using somatosensory neurons from TRPM8−/− mice and subtype-selective blockers of TRPM8 and TRPA1 channels, we demonstrate that responses to cold temperatures from TRPA1-expressing neurons are mediated by TRPA1 channels. We also identify two factors that affect the cold-sensitivity of TRPA1-expressing neurons: (1) cold-sensitive AITC-sensitive neurons express relatively more TRPA1 transcripts than cold-insensitive AITC-sensitive neurons and (2) voltage-gated potassium (KV) channels attenuate the cold-sensitivity of some TRPA1-expressing neurons. The combination of these two factors, combined with the relatively weak agonist-like activity of cold temperature on TRPA1 channels, partially explains why few TRPA1-expressing neurons respond to cold. Blocking KV channels also reveals another subclass of noxious cold-sensitive DRG neurons that do not express TRPM8 or TRPA1 channels. Altogether, the results of this study provide novel insights into the cold-sensitivity of different subclasses of somatosensory neurons.

AB  - Abstract
Neuroscientific research has made a concerted effort to determine cortical localization using various functional imaging techniques. This approach has undoubtedly yielded important novel anatomical knowledge, albeit at times contradictory, regarding the structural organization of the vestibular cortex. Unfortunately however, this knowledge has not translated to our understanding regarding how neural mechanisms control vestibular function. Based upon recent functional imaging, lesion and neuro-physiological data that have demonstrated (i) the close behavioral and neuro-anatomical relationship between cortical processing of vestibular and spatial attention signals, and (ii) that inducing interhemispheric competition can in-turn strongly modulate vestibular function akin to that observed in cortical lesion patients, I herewith propose the hypothesis that vestibular cortical processing is controlled, as per for spatial attention, via dynamic interhemispheric competition. In the first half of this review I discuss previous key findings in the field of vestibular neuroscience that can be reinterpreted to support the role of interhemispheric competition for the control of high-level vestibular functions. Contrastingly, in the second half of this review, I present previous findings that show how disrupting interhemispheric interactions can modulate the brainstem-mediated vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR). I conclude by speculating why interhemispheric competition induces correlated biases at the cortical and brainstem level respectively. Specifically, I propose that brainstem-mediated vestibulo-spatial and vestibulo-temporal transformations, in addition to coding for head displacement, underpin a generalized cortical magnitude estimation system which the CNS uses to construct dynamic spatio-temporal maps of the physical world, in-turn ensuring spatial orientation.

AB  - Abstract
Predatory open access is a controversial publishing business model that exploits the open-access system by charging publication fees in the absence of transparent editorial services. The credibility of academic publishing is now seriously threatened by predatory journals, whose articles are accorded real citations and thus contaminate the genuine scientific records of legitimate journals. This is of particular concern for public health since clinical practice relies on the findings generated by scholarly articles. Aim of this study was to compile a list of predatory journals targeting the neurosciences and neurology disciplines and to analyze the magnitude and geographical distribution of the phenomenon in these fields. Eighty-seven predatory journals operate in neurosciences and 101 in neurology, for a total of 2404 and 3134 articles issued, respectively. Publication fees range 521–637 USD, much less than those charged by genuine open-access journals. The country of origin of 26.0–37.0% of the publishers was impossible to determine due to poor websites or provision of vague or non-credible locations. Of the rest 35.3–42.0% reported their headquarters in the USA, 19.0–39.2% in India, 3.0–9.8% in other countries. Although calling themselves “open-access”, none of the journals retrieved was listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals. However, 14.9–24.7% of them were found to be indexed in PubMed and PubMed Central, which raises concerns on the criteria for inclusion of journals and publishers imposed by these popular databases. Scholars in the neurosciences are advised to use all the available tools to recognize predatory practices and avoid the downsides of predatory journals.

AB  - Abstract
To understand the behavioral consequences of intermittent anticipatory stress resulting from threats without accompanying physiological challenges, we developed a semi-naturalistic rodent housing and foraging environment that can include threats that are unpredictable in timing. Behavior is automatically recorded while rats forage for food or water. Over three weeks, the threats have been shown to elicit risk assessment behaviors, increase defensive burying and increase adrenal gland weight. To identify brain regions activated by this manipulation, we measured cytochrome c oxidase (COX), which is tightly coupled to neural activity. Adolescent male Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly assigned to control (CT) or unpredictable threat/stress (ST) housing conditions consisting of two tub cages, one with food and another with water, separated by a tunnel. Over three weeks (P31–P52), the ST group received randomly timed (probability of 0.25), simultaneous presentations of ferret odor, an abrupt light, and sound at the center of the tunnel. The ST group had consistently fewer tunnel crossings than the CT group, but similar body weights. Group differences in COX activity were detected in regions implicated in the control of defensive burying. There was an increase in COX activity in the hypothalamic premammillary dorsal nucleus (PMD) and lateral septum (LS), whereas a decrease was observed in the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and CA3 region of the hippocampus. There were no significant differences in the anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, striatum or motor cortex. The sites with changes in metabolic capacity are candidates for the sites of plasticity that may underlie the behavioral adaptations to intermittent threats.

AB  - Abstract
Objective: As maternal treatment with magnesium sulfate (MG) may protect the fetal brain, we sought to assess the inflammation associated neuroprotective potential of MG and its association to interleukin 1β (IL-1β). Methods: Pregnant Sprague–Dawley rats at 18-day gestation received i.p. lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or saline. Dams were randomized to treatment with s.c. saline (control), or MG prior to or following the i.p. injection, resulting in three groups. At the end of the treatment, fetal brain IL-1β was quantified for 18 pregnant rats (six of each group). Another 18 pregnant rats delivered spontaneously and pups were allowed to mature. At postnatal day 25, female offspring were examined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and analyzed using voxel based analysis. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and T2 relaxation protocols were performed to assess white and gray matter injury. Results: Offspring of LPS-treated dams exhibited (1) significantly increased T2 levels, and (2) increased ADC levels in white and gray matter, consistent with diffuse cerebral injury. Offspring of MG-treated LPS dams demonstrated similar T2 and ADC levels as control dams. Fetal brain IL-1β was significantly increased following maternal LPS compared to control (0.125 ± 0.01 vs 0.100 ± 0.01u, p &lt; 0.05). No significant decrease in IL-1β level was observed in response to maternal MG. Conclusions: Maternal LPS-induced neonatal brain injury can be prevented by maternal MG. Maternal MG therapy may be effective in human deliveries associated with maternal/fetal inflammation. The absence of a decrease in fetus brain levels of IL-1β following MG treatment implies that the mechanism of MG is not through inhibition of IL-1β production.
Significance statement
Intrauterine fetal exposure to maternal inflammation and pro-inflammatory cytokines is associated with adverse offspring neurological outcomes. Although its precise mechanism is not elucidated, magnesium sulfate (MG) is commonly used as neuroprotection for white matter brain injuries in preterm fetuses. A proposed mechanism involves the ability of MG to reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. In the current study, we used a rat model of LPS-induced maternal inflammation to investigate the short-term effect of MG on fetal brain IL-1β levels, and its long-term neuroprotective effect on the offspring brain by using MRI.

We demonstrated that maternal administration of MG can prevent long-term neonatal brain injury but, since no decrease was observed in fetal brain IL-1β levels, the neuro-protective mechanism of MG is not mediated by inhibition of IL-1β production.

AB  - Abstract
Comprehensive knowledge of the synaptic plasma membrane (SPM) proteome of a distinct brain region in a defined pathological state would greatly advance the understanding of the underlying biology of synaptic plasticity. The development of innovative approaches for studying the SPM proteome of small brain tissues is highly desired. This study presents a suitable protocol that integrates biotinylation-based affinity capture of cell surface-exposed proteins, isolation of synaptosomes, and biochemical extraction of SPM proteins from biotinylated hippocampal slices. The effectiveness of this integrated method was initially confirmed using immunoblot analysis of synaptic markers. Subsequently, we used highly sensitive mass spectrometry and streamlined bioinformatics to analyze the obtained SPM protein-enriched fraction. Our workflow positively identified 241 SPM proteins comprising 85 previously reported classical proteins from the pre- and/or post-synaptic membrane and 156 nonclassical proteins that localized to both the plasma membrane and synapse, and have not been previously reported as SPM proteins. Further analyses revealed considerable similarities in the physicochemical and functional properties of these proteins. Analysis of the interaction network using STRING indicated that the two groups showed a relatively strong functional correlation. Using MCODE analysis, we observed that 65 nonclassical SPM proteins formed 12 highly interconnected clusters with 47 classical SPM proteins, suggesting that they were the more likely SPM candidates. Taken together, the results of this study provide an integrated tool for analyzing the SPM proteome of small brain tissues, as well as a dataset of putative novel SPM proteins to improve the understanding of hippocampal synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Abstract
Brain glucose metabolism is altered in sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (sAD), whose pathologies are reproduced in rodents by intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of streptozotocin (STZ) in subdiabetogenic doses. The icv-STZ model also culminates in central cholinergic dysfunctions, which in turn are known to underlie both the sAD cognitive decline, and synaptic plasticity impairments. Considering the cognitive-enhancing potential of chronic nicotine (Nic), we investigated whether it attenuates icv-STZ-induced impairments in recognition memory and synaptic plasticity in a cognition-relevant substrate: the hippocampal CA1-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) pathway. Rats treated with icv-STZ were submitted to a chronic Nic regime, and were evaluated for recognition memory. We then examined long-term potentiation (LTP), paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) under urethane anesthesia, and brains were also evaluated for hippocampus-mPFC cell density. We found that Nic treatment prevents icv-STZ-induced disruptions in recognition memory and LTP. STZ did not precipitate neuronal death, while Nic alone was associated with higher neuronal density in CA1 when compared to vehicle-injected animals. Through combining behavioral, neurophysiological, and neuropathological observations into the Nic-STZ interplay, our study reinforces that cholinergic treatments are of clinical importance against early-stage Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairments.

AB  - Abstract
Chromatin regulation, in particular ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers, have previously been shown to be important in the regulation of reward-related behaviors in animal models of mental illnesses. Here we demonstrate that BAZ1A, an accessory subunit of the ISWI family of chromatin remodeling complexes, is downregulated in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of mice exposed repeatedly to cocaine and of cocaine-addicted humans. Viral-mediated overexpression of BAZ1A in mouse NAc reduces cocaine reward as assessed by conditioned place preference (CPP), but increases cocaine-induced locomotor activation. Furthermore, we investigate nucleosome repositioning genome-wide by conducting chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing for total H3 in NAc of control mice and after repeated cocaine administration, and find extensive nucleosome occupancy and shift changes across the genome in response to cocaine exposure. These findings implicate BAZ1A in molecular and behavioral plasticity to cocaine and offer new insight into the pathophysiology of cocaine addiction.

AB  - Abstract
Numerous clinical and experimental observations suggest that deficient neuronal signaling in the globus pallidus externa (GPe) is integral to both Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dystonia. In our previous studies in jaundiced dystonic rats, widespread silencing of neurons in GP (rodent equivalent to GPe) preceded and persisted during dystonic motor activity. We therefore hypothesized that on a background of slow and highly irregular and bursty neuronal activity in GP, cortical motor drive produces profound inhibition of GP as the basis for action-induced dystonia in Gunn rats. Presently, the neurotoxin ibotenate was injected locally into the motor territory of GP at one to four sites, over one to two tracts, in 19 normal rats. We found that highly circumscribed dorsal motor territory lesions reproducibly induced parkinsonism, while ventral lesions consistently produced dystonia. Post-lesioning, slow neuronal burst oscillations in the entopeduncular nucleus distinguished parkinsonian from dystonic rats. Next, we compared the deep brain stimulation contact sites in the GP internus used to treat patients with PD (n = 21 implants in 12 successive patients) versus dystonia (n = 16 implants in nine patients) and found the efficacious territory for ameliorating PD to be located chiefly dorsal to that for dystonia. The comparative distribution for treating PD versus dystonia was therefore anatomically consistent with that for inducing these features via GP lesions in rodents. Our collective findings thus suggest that dystonia and parkinsonism are differentially produced by pathological silencing of GPe neurons along distinct motor sub-circuits, resulting in disparate pathological basal ganglia output signaling.

AB  - Abstract
The group II metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR2 and mGluR3 are key modulators of glutamatergic neurotransmission. In order to identify novel Group II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-interacting partners, we screened the C-termini of mGluR2 and mGluR3 for interactions with an array of PDZ domains. These screens identified the Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factors 1 and 2 (NHERF-1 &amp; -2) as candidate interacting partners. Follow-up co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that both mGluR2 and mGluR3 can associate with NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 in a cellular context. Functional studies revealed that disruption of PDZ interactions with mGluR2 enhanced receptor signaling to Akt. However, further studies of mGluR2 and mGluR3 signaling in astrocytes in which NHERF expression was reduced by gene knockout (KO) and/or siRNA knockdown techniques revealed that the observed differences in signaling between WT and mutant mGluR2 were likely not due to disruption of interactions with the NHERF proteins. Electron microscopic analyses revealed that Group II mGluRs were primarily expressed in glia and unmyelinated axons in WT, NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 KO mice, but the relative proportion of labeled axons over glial processes was higher in NHERF-2 KO mice than in controls and NHERF-1 KO mice. Interestingly, our anatomical studies also revealed that loss of either NHERF protein results in ventriculomegaly, which may be related to the high incidence of hydrocephaly that has previously been observed in NHERF-1 KO mice. Together, these studies support a role for NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 in regulating the distribution of Group II mGluRs in the murine brain, while conversely the effects of the mGluR2/3 PDZ-binding motifs on receptor signaling are likely mediated by interactions with other PDZ scaffold proteins beyond the NHERF proteins.

AB  - Abstract
In the present study, we investigated the possible participation of the endocannabinoid system in the basolateral amygdala and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) or GABA-A receptor neurotransmission in the ventral tegmental area in the memory consolidation impairment induced by morphine administration. To measure memory formation, step-through type passive avoidance apparatus was used with adult male Wistar rats. The results showed that intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of morphine (3 and 6 mg/kg) after the successful training phase had an amnestic effect and induced memory consolidation impairment. After training, injection of a selective cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist, arachydonilcyclopropylamide (ACPA; 0.4–0.6 ng/rat) plus systemic injection of an ineffective dose of morphine (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) into the basolateral amygdala impaired memory consolidation suggesting the facilitatory effect of ACPA on morphine response. Also, the results showed that the injection of bicuculline, a GABA-A receptor antagonist (0.3–0.5 µg/rat) or NMDA (0.005–0.02 µg/rat) into the ventral tegmental area reversed ACPA-induced potentiation of morphine response and improved memory consolidation. It should be considered that the injection of ACPA into the basolateral amygdala and the injection of bicuculline or NMDA into the ventral tegmental area alone could not affect memory consolidation. Taken together, it seems that there is a functional interaction between the basolateral amygdala endocannabinoid system and the ventral tegmental area GABAergic- or glutamatergic neurotransmission in the modulation of morphine-induced memory consolidation impairment.

AB  - Abstract
Since functional imaging of whole body movements is not feasible with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the present study presents in vivo functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) as a suitable technique to measure body movement effects on fronto-temporo-parietal cortical activation in single- and dual-task paradigms. Previous fNIRS applications in studies addressing whole body movements were typically limited to the assessment of prefrontal brain areas. The current study investigated brain activation in the frontal, temporal and parietal cortex of both hemispheres using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) with two large 4 × 4 probe-sets with 24 channels each during single and dual gait tasks. 12 young healthy adults were measured using fNIRS walking on a treadmill: the participants performed two single-task (ST) paradigms (walking at different speeds, i.e. 3 and 5 km/h) and a dual task (DT) paradigm where a verbal fluency task (VFT) had to be executed while walking at 3 km/h. The results show an increase of activation in Broca’s area during the more advanced conditions (ST 5 km/h vs. ST 3 km/h, DT vs. ST 3 km/h, DT vs. 5 km/h), while the corresponding area on the right hemisphere was also activated. DT paradigms including a cognitive task in conjunction with whole body movements elicit wide-spread cortical activation patterns across fronto-temporo-parietal areas. An elaborate assessment of these activation patterns requires more extensive fNIRS assessments than the traditional prefrontal investigations, e.g. as performed with portable fNIRS devices.

Perception of speech sounds is affected by observing facial motion. Incongruence between speech sounds and watching somebody articulating may influence the perception of auditory syllable, referred to as the McGurk effect. We tested the degree to which silent articulation of a syllable also affects speech perception and searched for its neural correlates. Listeners were instructed to identify the auditory syllables /pa/ and /ta/ while silently articulating congruent/incongruent syllables or observing videos of a speaker’s face articulating them. As a baseline, we included an auditory-only condition without competing visual or sensorimotor input. As expected, perception of sounds degraded when incongruent syllables were observed, and also when they were silently articulated, albeit to a lesser extent. This degrading was accompanied by significant amplitude modulations in the beta frequency band in right superior temporal areas. In these areas, the event-related beta activity during congruent conditions was phase-locked to responses evoked during the auditory-only condition. We conclude that proper temporal alignment of different input streams in right superior temporal areas is mandatory for both audiovisual and audiomotor speech integration.

AB  - Abstract
The intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) is a flat thalamic nucleus implicated in the modulation of circadian rhythmicity. In rat, two main GABAergic subpopulations can be distinguished in the IGL: neurons synthesizing neuropeptide Y (NPY), which directly innervates the suprachiasmatic nuclei, and enkephalinergic cells, which connect contralaterally located leaflets. The aim of this study was to evaluate possible effects of inner IGL neurotransmitters on the spontaneous and synaptic activity of IGL neurons. The data presented in this article provide evidence that enkephalin, and not NPY, could act upon the majority of IGL neurons. Moreover, we investigated the type of opioid receptor activated by enkephalin and showed that the μ-receptor is functionally predominant in the IGL. The application of met-enkephalin not only robustly hyperpolarized IGL neurons (both putatively NPY-synthesizing and putatively enkephalinergic neurons), but it also was able to inhibit GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Based on this and previous studies, we hypothesize that IGL enkephalinergic neurons may act as powerful interneurons that inhibit themselves and NPY-synthesizing neurons, also in the contralaterally located IGL.

AB  - Abstract
In the spinal cord high extracellular glutamate evokes excitotoxic damage with neuronal loss and severe locomotor impairment. During the cell dysfunction process, extracellular pH becomes acid and may activate acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) which could be important contributors to neurodegenerative pathologies. Our previous studies have shown that transient application of the glutamate analog kainate (KA) evokes delayed excitotoxic death of spinal neurons, while white matter is mainly spared. The present goal was to enquire if ASIC channels modulated KA damage in relation to locomotor network function and cell death. Mouse spinal cord slices were treated with KA (0.01 or 0.1 mM) for 1 h, and then washed out for 24 h prior to analysis. RT-PCR results showed that KA (at 0.01 mM concentration that is near-threshold for damage) increased mRNA expression of ASIC1a, ASIC1b, ASIC2 and ASIC3, an effect reversed by the ASIC inhibitor 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). A KA neurotoxic dose (0.1 mM) reduced ASIC1a and ASIC2 expression. Cell viability assays demonstrated KA-induced large damage in spinal slices from mice with ASIC1a gene ablation. Likewise, immunohistochemistry indicated significant neuronal loss when KA was followed by the ASIC inhibitors DAPI or amiloride. Electrophysiological recording from ventral roots of isolated spinal cords showed that alternating oscillatory cycles were slowed down by 0.01 mM KA, and intensely inhibited by subsequently applied DAPI or amiloride. Our data suggest that early rise in ASIC expression and function counteracted deleterious effects on spinal networks by raising the excitotoxicity threshold, a result with potential implications for improving neuroprotection.

Practicing sport at top level requires excellent physical and cognitive skills. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether specific sport practice may affect the preparation–perception–action stages of processing during a visuo-motor task requiring perceptual discrimination and fast response. We recruited 39 participants (two groups of professional fencers and boxers, and a control group; N = 13 for each group) and measured behavioral performance and event-related potentials (ERPs) while performing a go/no-go task. Results revealed that athletes were faster than controls, while fencers were more accurate than boxers. ERP analysis revealed that motor preparation, indexed by the Bereitschaftspotential (BP), was increased in athletes than controls, whereas the top-down attentional control, reflected by the prefrontal negativity (pN) component, was enhanced only in fencers when compared to controls. Most of the post-stimulus ERPs i.e. the N1, the N2, the P3, and the pP2, were enhanced in fencers. Combat sports require fast action execution, but the preparatory brain activity might differ according to the specific practice required by each discipline. Boxers might afford to commit more errors (as reflected by high commission error (CE) rate and by a small pN amplitude), while fencers have to be as much fast and accurate as possible (thanks to an enhanced pN amplitude). Although the possible influence of repetitive head blows on cerebral activity cannot be excluded in boxers, our results suggest that cognitive benefits of high-level sport practice might also be transferred to the daily (i.e., no sport-related) activities.

AB  - Abstract
Exercise is increasingly being used as a treatment for alcohol use disorders (AUD), but the interactive effects of alcohol and exercise on the brain remain largely unexplored. Alcohol damages the brain, in part by altering glial functioning. In contrast, exercise promotes glial health and plasticity. In the present study, we investigated whether binge alcohol would attenuate the effects of subsequent exercise on glia. We focused on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), an alcohol-vulnerable region that also undergoes neuroplastic changes in response to exercise. Adult female Long-Evans rats were gavaged with ethanol (25% w/v) every 8 h for 4 days. Control animals received an isocaloric, non-alcohol diet. After 7 days of abstinence, rats remained sedentary or exercised for 4 weeks. Immunofluorescence was then used to label microglia, astrocytes, and neurons in serial tissue sections through the mPFC. Confocal microscope images were processed using FARSIGHT, a computational image analysis toolkit capable of automated analysis of cell number and morphology. We found that exercise increased the number of microglia in the mPFC in control animals. Binged animals that exercised, however, had significantly fewer microglia. Furthermore, computational arbor analytics revealed that the binged animals (regardless of exercise) had microglia with thicker, shorter arbors and significantly less branching, suggestive of partial activation. We found no changes in the number or morphology of mPFC astrocytes. We conclude that binge alcohol exerts a prolonged effect on morphology of mPFC microglia and limits the capacity of exercise to increase their numbers.

AB  - Abstract
The limbic system has a central role for the integration of several cognitive and visceral functions through an extended network of connections involving the hippocampus and the amygdala.

A number of studies performed in humans have been dedicated to the investigation of supratentorial limbic pathways by means of non-invasive MRI approaches, such as DTI. However, detection of possible limbic connections involving the brainstem and the spinal cord is still missing.

Subtentorial limbic pathways have been previously studied in animals by means of invasive approaches, including viral tracing. The detection of limbic connections with the brainstem and the spinal cord has raised several new hypotheses regarding the interaction between the central nervous system and the periphery of the body.

We investigated subtentorial limbic connections in twenty-one healthy humans by means of probabilistic constrained spherical deconvolution tractography. Our connectivity analysis showed, for both the hippocampus and the amygdala, a high probability of connections with the midbrain, pons, and bulb. Moreover, hippocampal and amygdalar pathways reaching the cervical spinal cord were also detected. Quantitative evaluation of diffusion parameters was also performed.

Findings of the present study are in agreement with the literature and provide the first report of possible limbic connections between the brainstem and the spinal cord in human brain. Since these pathways might also have important implications both in physiological and pathological contexts, further studies should be conducted in order to confirm our data as well as to define functional features of these brain connections.

AB  - Abstract
Levodopa-induced dyskinesias are abnormal involuntary movements that limit the effectiveness of treatments for Parkinson’s disease. Although dyskinesias involve the striatum, it is unclear how striatal neurons are involved in dyskinetic movements. Here we record from striatal neurons in mice during levodopa-induced axial dyskinesias. We developed an automated 3-dimensional motion tracking system to capture the development of axial dyskinesias at ∼10 ms resolution, and correlated these movements with neuronal activity of striatal medium spiny neurons and fast-spiking interneurons. The average firing rate of medium spiny neurons increased as axial dyskinesias developed, and both medium spiny neurons and fast-spiking interneurons were modulated around axial dyskinesias. We also found that delta field potential power increased in the striatum with dyskinesia, and that this increased delta power coupled with striatal neurons. Our findings provide insight into how striatal networks change as levodopa-induced dyskinesias develop, and suggest that increased medium spiny neuron firing, increased delta field potential power, and abnormal delta-coupling may be neurophysiological signatures of dyskinesias. These data could be helpful in understanding the role of the striatum in the pathogenesis of dyskinesias in Parkinson’s disease.

AB  - Abstract
The sensory systems in animals constantly monitor the environment and process salient and relevant features while subtracting background activity. This process requires continuous recalibration of neuronal gain based on recent history. Adaptation has been postulated to be the key mechanism by which neurons rapidly tune their response curves to represent the entire dynamic range of external inputs.

Rodents heavily rely on their vibrissa system while gathering information about their surroundings using whisking. Neuronal adaptation is observed in all stages of sensory processing, from the whisker follicle through the brainstem and thalamus up to the barrel cortex. In this review, we discuss the intrinsic, synaptic and network mechanisms of adaptation such as short-term synaptic depression, inhibitory suppression, balance between excitation and inhibition as well as the role of cascading adaptation. Furthermore, we describe recent findings about the different intensity dependent adaptation properties in the two major somatosensory pathways and their possible implications about coding.

AB  - Abstract
Neuropathic pain resulting from spinal cord injury is often accompanied by maladaptive plasticity of the central nervous system, including the opioid receptor-rich periaqueductal gray (PAG). Evidence suggests that sensory signaling via the PAG is robustly modulated by dopamine D1- and D2-like receptors, but the effect of damage to the spinal cord on D1 and D2 receptor protein expression and function in the PAG has not been examined. Here we show that 21 days after a T10 or C6 spinothalamic tract lesion, both mice and rats display a remarkable decline in the expression of D1 receptors in the PAG, revealed by western blot analysis. These changes were associated with a significant reduction in hindpaw withdrawal thresholds in lesioned animals compared to sham-operated controls. We investigated the consequences of diminished D1 receptor levels by quantifying D1-like receptor-mediated phosphorylation of ERK1,2 and CREB, events that have been observed in numerous brain structures. In naïve animals, western blot analysis revealed that ERK1,2, but not CREB phosphorylation was significantly increased in the PAG by the D1-like agonist SKF 81297. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that SKF 81297 increased ERK1,2 phosphorylation in the PAG of sham animals. However, in lesioned animals, basal pERK1,2 levels were elevated and did not significantly increase after exposure to SKF 81297. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis that molecular adaptations resulting in a decrease in D1 receptor expression and signaling in the PAG are a consequence of SCL.

AB  - Abstract
Bexarotene has been proved to have neuroprotective effects in many animal models of neurological diseases. However, its neuroprotection in traumatic brain injury (TBI) is still unknown. This study aims to explore the neuroprotective effects of bexarotene on TBI and its possible mechanism. Controlled cortical impact (CCI) model was used to simulate TBI in C57BL/6 mice as well as APOE gene knockout (APOE-KO) mice. After CCI, mice were daily dosed with bexarotene or vehicle solution intraperitoneally. The motor function, learning and memory, inflammatory factors, microglia amount, apoptosis condition around injury site and main side-effects were all measured. The results showed that, after CCI, bexarotene treatment markedly improved the motor function and spatial memory in C57BL/6 compare to APOE-KO mice which showed no improvement. The inflammatory cytokines, microglia amount, cell apoptosis rate, and protein of cleaved caspase-3 around the injury site were markedly upregulated after TBI in both C57BL/6 and APOE-KO mice, and all these upregulation were significantly mitigated by bexarotene treatment in C57BL/6 mice, but not in APOE-KO mice. No side-effects were detected after consecutive administration. Taken together, bexarotene inhibits the inflammatory response as well as cell apoptosis and improves the neurological function of mice after TBI partially through apolipoprotein E. This may make it a promising candidate for the therapeutic treatment after TBI.

AB  - Abstract
In the vertebrate brain, inhibition is largely mediated by γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). This neurotransmitter comprises a signaling machinery of GABAA, GABAB receptors, transporters, glutamate decarboxylases (gads) and 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase (abat), and associated proteins. Chloride is intimately related to GABAA receptor conductance, GABA uptake, and GADs activity. The response of target neurons to GABA stimuli is shaped by chloride-cation co-transporters (CCCs), which strictly control Cl− gradient across plasma membranes. This research profiled the expression of forty genes involved in GABA signaling in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) brain, grouped brain regions and retinas. Primer pairs were developed for reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The mRNA levels of the zebrafish GABA system share similarities with that of mammals, and confirm previous studies in non-mammalian species. Proposed GABAA receptors are α1β2γ2, α1β2δ, α2bβ3γ2, α2bβ3δ, α4β2γ2, α4β2δ, α6bβ2γ2 and α6bβ2δ. Regional brain differences were documented. Retinal hetero- or homomeric ρ-composed GABAA receptors could exist, accompanying α1βyγ2, α1βyδ, α6aβyγ2, α6aβyδ. Expression patterns of α6a and α6b were opposite, with the former being more abundant in retinas, the latter in brains. Given the stoichiometry α6wβyγz, α6a- or α6b-containing receptors likely have different regulatory mechanisms. Different gene isoforms could originate after the rounds of genome duplication during teleost evolution. This research depicts that one isoform is generally more abundantly expressed than the other. Such observations also apply to GABAB receptors, GABA transporters, GABA-related enzymes, CCCs and GABAA receptor-associated proteins, whose presence further strengthens the proof of a GABA system in zebrafish.

AB  - Abstract
Inference on nociceptive and pain-related processes from functional magnetic resonance imaging is made with the assumption that the coupling of neuronal activity and cerebral hemodynamic changes is stable. However, since nociceptive stimulation is associated with increases in systemic arterial pressure, it is essential to determine whether this coupling remains the same during different levels of nociception and pain. The main objective of the present study was to compare the amplitude of local field potentials (LFP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes in the primary somatosensory cortex during nociceptive electrical stimulation of the contralateral or ipsilateral forepaw in isoflurane-anesthetized rats, while manipulating mean arterial pressure (MAP). MAP changes induced by nociceptive stimulation were manipulated by transecting the spinal cord at the upper thoracic segments (T1–T2), which interrupts sympathetic pathways and prevents nociception-related MAP increases, while sensory pathways between the forepaws and the brain remain intact. Intensity-dependent increases in MAP and CBF were observed and these effects were abolished or significantly decreased after spinal transection (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively). In contrast, the intensity-dependent changes in LFP amplitude were decreased for the contralateral stimulation but increased for the ipsilateral stimulation after spinal transection (p &lt; 0.05). Thus, neurovascular coupling was altered differently by stimulus-induced MAP changes, depending on stimulus intensity and location. This demonstrates that CBF changes evoked by nociceptive processing do not always match neuronal activity, which may lead to inaccurate estimation of neuronal activity from hemodynamic changes. These results have important implications for neuroimaging of nociceptive and pain-related processes.

Extensive studies have reported cognitive abnormalities in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Another line of evidence suggests that stress also affects cognitive functions. In this study, we investigated whether there were associations between stress hormones and cognitive functions in ASD and typically developing (TD) children. Cognitive functions in ASD and TD children were evaluated with a battery of psychological tests for working memory, behavioral flexibility, and social cognition for emotional assessments of others. ASD children exhibited higher hair and salivary cortisol, which reflects chronic and acute stress hormone levels of subjects, respectively, than TD children. Autism-spectrum quotient (AQ) was positively correlated with hair cortisol and the scores of Spence Children's Anxiety Scale in ASD children. In addition, a negative correlation was present between spatial working memory performance and hair cortisol in ASD, but not in TD, children. These results suggest that chronic stress hormone elevation may have relationships with some aspects of cognitive dysfunction in ASD subjects.

AB  - Abstract
Adolescence is a period of major brain white matter (WM) changes, and membrane lipid metabolism likely plays a critical role in brain WM myelination. Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) are essential components of cell membranes including oligodendrocytes, and LC-PUFA release and turnover in membranes is regulated by phospholipase A2 enzymes. To investigate the role of membrane lipid metabolism in healthy WM myelination across adolescence, the present study examined the relationship between membrane LC-PUFA biostatus, phospholipase A2 activity, and brain WM microstructure in healthy subjects aged 9–20 years (n = 30). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed to measure average fractional anisotropy (FA) and diffusivity (indices sensitive to WM myelination) of nine major cerebral WM tracts. Blood samples were collected to measure erythrocyte membrane fatty acid concentrations and plasma intracellular phospholipase A2 activity (inPLA2). Plasma inPLA2 activity showed a significant U-curved association with WM radial diffusivity, and an inverted U-curved association with WM FA, independent of age. A significant positive linear correlation was observed between docosahexaenoic acid concentration and axial diffusivity in the corpus callosum. These findings suggest that there may be optimal physiological inPLA2 activity levels associated with healthy WM myelination in late childhood and adolescence. Myelination may be mediated by cleavage of docosahexaenoic acid from membrane phospholipids by inPLA2. These findings have implications for our understanding of the role of LC-PUFA homeostasis in myelin-related neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - Abstract
As a complex disease, traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result in long-term psychiatric changes and sensorimotor and cognitive impairments. The TBI-induced loss of memory and long-term cognitive dysfunction are related to mechanistic factors including an increased inflammatory response, autophagy, edema, and ischemia. Many published studies have offered evidence for the neuroprotective effects and anti-inflammatory properties of ketamine for TBI patients. Nonetheless, there is a limited understanding of the accurate mechanism that underlies the potential neuroprotective effects of ketamine. Herein, it can be shown that posttraumatic administration of ketamine at a sub-anesthetic dose (10 mg/kg ketamine, every 24 h up to 7 days) can prevent the TBI-induced production of IL-6 and TNF-α, attenuate deficits of dendrites and spines and exert beneficial effects on memory and behavior. Moreover, studies show that ketamine may activate the mTOR signaling pathway by p-mTOR induction to down-regulate the expression of crucial autophagic proteins such as LC3 and Beclin-1. According to these findings, ameliorating secondary brain injury and anti-inflammatory properties is closely related to the neuroprotection of ketamine, which supports the use of ketamine as a potential therapy for patients with TBI to alleviate functional deficits.

AB  - Abstract
The subiculum is a pivotal structure located in the hippocampal formation that receives inputs from grid and place cells and that mediates the output from the hippocampus to cortical and sub-cortical areas. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of boundary vector cells (BVC) in the subiculum, as well as exceptional stability during recordings conducted in the dark, suggesting that the subiculum is involved in the coding of allocentric cues and also in path integration. In order to better understand the role of the subiculum in spatial processing and the coding of external cues, we recorded subicular units in freely moving rats while performing two experiments: the “size experiment” in which we modified the arena size, and the “barrier experiment” in which we inserted new barriers in a familiar open field thus dividing the enclosure into four comparable sub-chambers. We hypothesized that if physical boundaries were deterministic of the firing of subicular units a strong spatial replication pattern would be found in most spatially modulated units. In contrast, our results demonstrate heterogeneous space coding by different cell types: place cells, barrier-related units and BVC. We also found units characterized by narrow spike waveforms, most likely belonging to axonal recordings, that showed grid-like patterns. Our data indicate that the subiculum codes space in a flexible manner, and that it is involved in the processing of allocentric information, external cues and path integration, thus broadly supporting spatial navigation.

AB  - Abstract
Perceiving and reproducing direction of visual stimuli in 2-D space produces the visual oblique effect, which manifests as increased precision in the reproduction of cardinal compared to oblique directions. A second cognitive oblique effect emerges when stimulus information is degraded (such as when reproducing stimuli from memory) and manifests as a systematic distortion where reproduced directions close to the cardinal axes deviate toward the oblique, leading to space expansion at cardinal and contraction at oblique axes. We studied the oblique effect in 3-D using a virtual reality system to present a large number of stimuli, covering the surface of an imaginary half sphere, to which subjects had to reach. We used two conditions, one with no delay (no-memory condition) and one where a three-second delay intervened between stimulus presentation and movement initiation (memory condition). A visual oblique effect was observed for the reproduction of cardinal directions compared to oblique, which did not differ with memory condition. A cognitive oblique effect also emerged, which was significantly larger in the memory compared to the no-memory condition, leading to distortion of directional space with expansion near the cardinal axes and compression near the oblique axes on the hemispherical surface. This effect provides evidence that existing models of 2-D directional space categorization could be extended in the natural 3-D space.

AB  - Abstract
Early life experiences, particularly the experience with parents, are crucial to phenotypic outcomes in both humans and animals. Although the effects of maternal deprivation on offspring well-being have been studied, paternal deprivation (PD) has received little attention despite documented associations between father absence and children health problems in humans. In the present study, we utilized the socially monogamous prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster), which displays male–female pair bonding and bi-parental care, to examine the effects of PD on adult behaviors and neurochemical expression in the hippocampus. Male and female subjects were randomly assigned into one of two experimental groups that grew up with both the mother and father (MF) or with the mother-only (MO, to generate PD experience). Our data show that MO subjects received less parental licking/grooming and carrying and were left alone in the nest more frequently than MF subjects. At adulthood (∼75 days of age), MO subjects displayed increased social affiliation (SOA) toward a conspecific compared to MF subjects, but the two groups did not differ in social recognition (SOR) and anxiety-like behavior. Interestingly, MO subjects showed consistent increases in both gene and protein expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) as well as the levels of total histone 3 and histone 3 acetylation in the hippocampus compared to MF subjects. Further, PD experience increased glucocorticoid receptor beta (GRβ) protein expression in the hippocampus of females as well as increased corticotrophin receptor 2 (CRHR2) protein expression in the hippocampus of males, but decreased CRHR2 mRNA in both sexes. Together, our data suggest that PD has a long-lasting, behavior-specific effect on SOA and alters hippocampal neurochemical systems in the vole brain. The functional role of such altered neurochemical systems in social behaviors and the potential involvement of epigenetic events should be further studied.

AB  - Abstract
The CNTNAP2 (contactin-associated protein-like 2) gene, highly expressed in the human prefrontal cortex, has been linked with autism and language impairment. Potential relationships between CNTNAP2, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and cognition have been suggested by previous clinical studies, but have not been directly examined in the same study. The current study collected structural MRI, genetic, and behavioral data in 317 healthy Chinese adults, and examined associations between CNTNAP2 variants, DLPFC, and cognitive performance (measured by the Stroop task). After controlling for intracranial volume, sex, and age, the CNTNAP2 genetic polymorphism at SNP rs7809486 had the strongest association with bilateral DLPFC volume (p = 0.00015 and 0.00014 for left and right DLPFC volumes, respectively), with GG homozygotes having greater bilateral DLPFC volumes and surface areas than the other genotypes. Furthermore, TT homozygotes of CNTNAP2 rs4726946 (a nearby SNP that had moderate linkage disequilibrium with rs7809486) had greater left DLPFC volume and surface area, and better cognitive performance than the other genotypes. Subjects with greater left DLPFC surface area had better cognitive performance. Importantly, the left DLPFC surface area mediated the association between the CNTNAP2 rs4726946 genotype and cognitive performance. This study provides the first evidence for associations among the CNTNAP2 gene, left DLPFC structure, and cognitive control.

AB  - Abstract
Many focal cerebral ischemia models utilize the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) evoked by coagulation to induce ischemic damage in the cortex and mimic the pathology observed in human patients. A second, increasingly popular model, the photothrombotic stroke, uses a laser beam to irradiate the MCA after administration of a photosensitizing dye. This widely used procedure is slowly replacing the MCAO model because of the easiness of the surgical protocol and the reproducibility of the damage. However, the photochemical reaction also results in wider microvascular injury. In this study, we have evaluated the impact of these two types of stroke in the cell survival and evolution of stroke, focusing on microglial cells, the first responders to cell injury. Two groups of heterozygote Cx3CR1-GFP reporter mice (to follow microglia) were subject to stroke injury either with coagulator-mediated occlusion or photothrombotic MCA damage. Microglial cells’ dynamics of activation and phagocytosis together with astrocytic response and leukocyte infiltration were characterized at 1, 3 and 7 days after damage. Photothrombotic stroke delayed microglial and astrocytic invasion of the ischemic core and accumulation of phagocytic microglia. It also elicited higher levels of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and increased infiltration from the periphery. In addition, only the neurons in the MCAO stroke showed phenotype plasticity by downregulating the transcription factor NeuN. These data provide a better understanding of the exact temporal and spatial dynamics of the inflammatory response in these two animal models of stroke and identify more relevant targets for human therapy.

AB  - Abstract
Auditory-visual (AV) events often involve a leading visual cue (e.g. auditory-visual speech) that allows the perceiver to generate predictions about the upcoming auditory event. Electrophysiological evidence suggests that when an auditory event is predicted, processing is sped up, i.e., the N1 component of the ERP occurs earlier (N1 facilitation). However, it is not clear (1) whether N1 facilitation is based specifically on predictive rather than multisensory integration and (2) which particular properties of the visual cue it is based on. The current experiment used artificial AV stimuli in which visual cues predicted but did not co-occur with auditory cues. Visual form cues (high and low salience) and the auditory-visual pairing were manipulated so that auditory predictions could be based on form and timing or on timing only. The results showed that N1 facilitation occurred only for combined form and temporal predictions. These results suggest that faster auditory processing (as indicated by N1 facilitation) is based on predictive processing generated by a visual cue that clearly predicts both what and when the auditory stimulus will occur.

AB  - Abstract
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) might affect the central nervous system by causing neuroinflammation, which subsequently leads to brain damage and dysfunction. In this study, we evaluated the role of nod-like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation in long-term behavioral alterations of 8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice injected intraperitoneally with LPS (5 mg/kg). At different time points after injection, we assessed locomotor function with a 24-point neurologic deficit scoring system and the rotarod test; assessed recognition memory with the novel object recognition test; and assessed emotional abnormality (anhedonia and behavioral despair) with the tail suspension test, forced swim test, and sucrose preference test. We also assessed protein expression of NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), and caspase-1 p10 in hippocampus by Western blotting; measured levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and IL-10 in hippocampus; measured TNFα and IL-1β in serum by ELISA; and evaluated microglial activity in hippocampus by Iba1 immunofluorescence. We found that LPS-injected mice displayed long-term depression-like behaviors and recognition memory deficit; elevated expression of NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 p10; increased levels of IL-1β, IL-18, and TNFα; decreased levels of IL-10; and increased microglial activation. These effects were blocked by the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone. The results demonstrate proof of concept that NLRP3 inflammasome activation contributes to long-term behavioral alterations in LPS-exposed mice, probably through enhanced inflammation, and that NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition might alleviate peripheral and brain inflammation and thereby ameliorate long-term behavioral alterations in LPS-exposed mice.

AB  - Abstract
Most of the literature on the brain impedance proposes a frequency-independent resistive model. Recently, this conclusion was tackled by a series of papers (Bédard et al., 2006; Bédard and Destexhe, 2009; Gomes et al., 2016), based on microscopic sale modeling and measurements. Our paper aims to investigate the impedance issue using simultaneous in vivo depth and surface signals recorded during intracerebral electrical stimulation of epileptic patients, involving a priori different tissues with different impedances. Our results confirm the conclusions from Logothethis et al. (2007): there is no evidence of frequency dependence of the brain tissue impedance (more precisely, there is no difference, in terms of frequency filtering, between the brain and the skull bone), at least at a macroscopic scale. In order to conciliate findings from both microscopic and macroscopic scales, we recall different neural/synaptic current generators’ models from the literature and we propose an original computational model, based on fractional dynamics.

AB  - Abstract
The aim of the present study was to determine whether adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) mediated transfer of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and RhoA shRNA has additive effects on promoting the survival and axon regeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) after optic nerve crush (ONC). Silencing effects of AAV-RhoA shRNA were confirmed by examining neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, and by quantifying RhoA expression levels with western blotting. Young adult Fischer rats received an intravitreal injection of (i) saline, (ii) AAV green fluorescent protein (GFP), (iii) AAV-CNTF, (iv) AAV-RhoA shRNA, or (v) a combination of both AAV-CNTF and AAV-RhoA shRNA. Two weeks later, the ON was completely crushed. Three weeks after ONC, RGC survival was estimated by counting βIII-tubulin-positive neurons in retinal whole mounts. Axon regeneration was evaluated by counting GAP-43-positive axons in the crushed ON. It was found that AAV-RhoA shRNA decreased RhoA expression levels and promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro. In the ONC model, AAV-RhoA shRNA by itself had only weak beneficial effects on RGC axon regeneration. However, when combined with AAV-CNTF, AAV-RhoA shRNA significantly improved the therapeutic effect of AAV-CNTF on axon regeneration by nearly two fold, even though there was no significant change in RGC viability. In sum, this combination of vectors increases the regenerative response and can lead to more successful therapeutic outcomes following neurotrauma.

AB  - Abstract
Stress and withdrawal of female reproductive hormones are known risk factors of postpartum depression. Although both of these factors are capable of powerfully modulating neuronal plasticity, there is no direct electron microscopic evidence of hippocampal spine synapse remodeling in postpartum depression. To address this issue, hormonal conditions of pregnancy and postpartum period were simulated in ovariectomized adult female Sprague–Dawley rats (n = 76). The number of hippocampal spine synapses and the depressive behavior of rats in an active escape task were investigated in untreated control, hormone-withdrawn ‘postpartum’, simulated proestrus, and hormone-treated ‘postpartum’ animals. After ‘postpartum’ withdrawal of gonadal steroids, inescapable stress caused a loss of hippocampal spine synapses, which was related to poor escape performance in hormone-withdrawn ‘postpartum’ females. These responses were equivalent with the changes observed in untreated controls that is an established animal model of major depression. Maintaining proestrus levels of ovarian hormones during ‘postpartum’ stress exposure did not affect synaptic and behavioral responses to inescapable stress in simulated proestrus animals. By contrast, maintaining pregnancy levels of estradiol and progesterone during ‘postpartum’ stress exposure completely prevented the stress-induced loss of hippocampal spine synapses, which was associated with improved escape performance in hormone-treated ‘postpartum’ females. This protective effect appears to be mediated by a muted stress response as measured by serum corticosterone concentrations. In line with our emerging ‘synaptogenic hypothesis’ of depression, the loss of hippocampal spine synapses may be a novel perspective both in the pathomechanism and in the clinical management of postpartum affective illness.

AB  - Abstract
The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) is known to play an important role in feeding behavior and the control of sympathetic nerve activity (SNA). We report the identification of novel neuron groups that showed oscillations on both sides of the VMH in hypothalamus slice preparations from juvenile rats of postnatal days 5–14. We detected spontaneous rhythmic burst activity with a frequency of around 0.06 Hz typically in the dorsolateral region of the VMH (i.e., VMH oscillation) using optical recordings (voltage and calcium imaging), field potential recordings and intracellular membrane potential recordings. The oscillation was also confirmed after isolation of the VMH from other hypothalamic structures. The frequency of oscillation was increased by lowering the glucose concentration of the superfusate. To evaluate the relation between VMH oscillation and SNA, we simultaneously recorded VMH oscillation, SNA from the thoracic sympathetic nerve trunk and phrenic nerve discharge (Phr) in the decerebrate and arterially perfused in situ preparation from juvenile rats of postnatal days 5–11. Power spectral analysis in the arterially perfused in situ rat preparation revealed similar peak values to those of slice preparations within the low-frequency range between the VMH oscillation and sympathetic nerve trunk activity. In addition, we analyzed cross-correlations between the VMH, SNA and Phr. The results revealed that a predominant positive correlation of the VMH activity with the SNA existed with an average time lag of 2.4 s, suggesting the presence of functional couplings between the VMH and SNA (and respiratory center) in the lower brainstem and spinal cord. We hypothesize that the VMH oscillation might be involved in low-frequency modulation of the SNA.

AB  - Abstract
Adult mammalian CNS axons generally do not regenerate, creating an obstacle to effective repair and recovery after neuronal injury. The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is an essential signal transduction cascade that regulates axon growth and neurite extension in the developing mammalian embryo. In this study, we investigated whether a Wnt/β-catenin signaling activator could be repurposed to induce regeneration in the adult CNS after axonal injury. We used a retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon crush injury model in a transgenic Wnt reporter mouse, and intravitreal injections were used to deliver Wnt3a or saline to the RGC cell bodies within the retina. Our findings demonstrated that Wnt3a induced Wnt signaling in RGCs and resulted in significant axonal regrowth past the lesion site when measured at two and four weeks post-injury. Furthermore, Wnt3a-injected eyes showed increased survival of RGCs and significantly higher pattern electroretinography (PERG) amplitudes compared to the control. Additionally, Wnt3a-induced axonal regeneration and RGC survival were associated with elevated activation of the transcription factor Stat3, and reducing expression of Stat3 using a conditional Stat3 knock-out mouse line led to diminished Wnt3a-dependent axonal regeneration and RGC survival. Therefore, these findings reveal a novel role for retinal Wnt signaling in axonal regrowth and RGC survival following axonal injury, which may lead to the development of novel therapies for axonal regeneration.

AB  - Abstract
While apolipoprotein (Apo) E4 is linked to increased incidence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), there is growing evidence that it plays a role in functional brain irregularities that are independent of AD pathology. However, ApoE4-driven functional differences within olfactory processing regions have yet to be examined. Utilizing knock-in mice humanized to ApoE4 versus the more common ApoE3, we examined a simple olfactory perceptual memory that relies on the transfer of information from the olfactory bulb (OB) to the piriform cortex (PCX), the primary cortical region involved in higher order olfaction. In addition, we have recorded in vivo resting and odor-evoked local field potentials (LPF) from both brain regions and measured corresponding odor response magnitudes in anesthetized young (6-month-old) and middle-aged (12-month-old) ApoE mice. Young ApoE4 compared to ApoE3 mice exhibited a behavioral olfactory deficit coinciding with hyperactive odor-evoked response magnitudes within the OB that were not observed in older ApoE4 mice. Meanwhile, middle-aged ApoE4 compared to ApoE3 mice exhibited heightened response magnitudes in the PCX without a corresponding olfactory deficit, suggesting a shift with aging in ApoE4-driven effects from OB to PCX. Interestingly, the increased ApoE4-specific response in the PCX at middle-age was primarily due to a dampening of baseline spontaneous activity rather than an increase in evoked response power. Our findings indicate that early ApoE4-driven olfactory memory impairments and OB network abnormalities may be a precursor to later network dysfunction in the PCX, a region that not only is targeted early in AD, but may be selectively vulnerable to ApoE4 genotype.

AB  - Abstract
In the spinal cord, glycine and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) are inhibitory neurotransmitters. However, the ontogeny of the glycinergic network remains unclear. To address this point, we examined the developmental formation of glycinergic terminals by immunohistochemistry for glycine transporter 2 (GlyT2), a marker of glycinergic terminals, in developing mouse cervical spinal cord. Furthermore, the developmental localization of GlyT2 was compared with that of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), a marker of GABAergic terminals, and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), a marker of inhibitory terminals, by single and double immunolabeling. GlyT2-positive dots (glycinergic terminals) were first detected in the marginal zone on embryonic day 14 (E14). In the ventral horn, they were detected at E16 and increased in observed density during postnatal development. Until postnatal day 7 (P7), GAD-positive dots (GABAergic terminals) were dominant and GlyT2 immunolabeling was localized at GAD-positive dots. During the second postnatal week, GABAergic terminals markedly decreased and glycinergic terminals became dominant. In the dorsal horn, glycinergic terminals were detected at P0 in lamina IV and P7 in lamina III and developmentally increased. GlyT2 was also localized at GAD-positive dots, and colocalizing dots were dominant at P21. VGAT-positive dots (inhibitory terminals) continued to increase until P21. These results suggest that GABAergic terminals first appear during embryonic development and may often change to colocalizing terminals throughout the gray matter during development. The colocalizing terminals may remain in the dorsal horn, whereas in the ventral horn, colocalizing terminals may give rise to glycinergic terminals.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system resulting from degeneration of the myelin sheath. This study is aimed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the brain of EAE-induced normal diet (ND) mice and high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice, and to identify novel genes responsible for elucidating the mechanism of the disease. Purified mRNA samples from the brain tissue were analyzed for gene microarray and validated by real-time RT-PCR. DEGs were identified if significant changes greater than 1.5-fold or less than 0.66-fold were observed (p &lt; 0.05). Pathway construction and functional categorization were performed using the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathways and gene ontology (GO) analysis. HFD-EAE mice showed more severe disease symptoms than ND-EAE mice. From GO study, fold changes of HFD-EAE to ND-EAE genes indicated that the genes were significantly associated to the pathways related with the immune response, antigen presentation, and complement activation. The genes related with metal ion-binding proteins were upregulated in HFD-EAE and ND-EAE mice. Upregulation of Cul9, Mast2, and C4b expression is significantly higher in HFD-EAE mice than ND-EAE mice. Cul9, Mast2, C4b, Psmb8, Ly86, and Ms4a6d were significantly upregulated in both ND- and HFD-EAE mice. Fcgr4, S3-12, Gca, and Zdhhc4 were upregulated only in ND-EAE, and Xlr4b was upregulated only in HFD-EAE mice. And significant upregulated genes of metal ion-binding proteins (Cul9 and Mast2) were observed in HFD-EAE mice.

AB  - Abstract
Major depressive disorder is a serious psychiatric condition associated with high rates of suicide and is a leading cause of health burden worldwide. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of major depression are still essentially unclear. In our study, a non-targeted gas chromatography–mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach was used to investigate metabolic changes in the prefrontal cortex of the learned helplessness (LH) rat model of depression. Body-weight measurements and behavioral tests including the active escape test, sucrose preference test, forced swimming test, elevated plus-maze and open field test were used to assess changes in the behavioral spectrum after inescapable footshock stress. Rats in the stress group exhibited significant learned helpless and depression-like behaviors, while without any significant change in anxiety-like behaviors. Using multivariate and univariate statistical analysis, a total of 18 differential metabolites were identified after the footshock stress protocol. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis and MetaboAnalyst were applied for predicted pathways and biological functions analysis. “Amino Acid Metabolism, Molecule Transport, Small Molecule Biochemistry” was the most significantly altered network in the LH model. Amino acid metabolism, particularly glutamate metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, was significantly perturbed in the prefrontal cortex of LH rats.

AB  - Abstract
The aging process and menopausal transition are important factors in sexual dysfunction of menopausal women. No neuroimaging study has assessed the age- and menopause-related changes on brain activation areas associated with sexual arousal in menopausal women. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the time course of regional brain activity associated with sexual arousal evoked by visual stimulation in premenopausal and menopausal women, and further to assess the effect of menopause on the brain areas associated with sexual arousal in menopausal women using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Thirty volunteers consisting of 15 premenopausal and 15 menopausal women underwent the fMRI. For the activation condition, volunteers viewed sexually arousing visual stimulation. The brain areas with significantly higher activation in premenopausal women compared with menopausal women included the thalamus, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) using analysis of covariance adjusting for age (p &lt; 0.005). Blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal changes in the amygdala while viewing erotic video were positively correlated with estrogen levels in the two groups. Our findings suggest that reduced brain activity of the thalamus, amygdala, and ACC in menopausal women may be associated with menopause-related decrease in sexual arousal. These findings might help elucidate the neural mechanisms associated with sexual dysfunction in menopausal women.

AB  - Abstract
Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) conjugation (SUMOylation) plays key roles in neurologic function in health and disease. Neuronal SUMOylation is essential for emotionality and cognition, and this pathway is dramatically activated in post-ischemic neurons, a neuroprotective response to ischemia. It is also known from cell culture studies that SUMOylation modulates gene expression. However, it remains unknown how SUMOylation regulates neuronal gene expression in vivo, in the physiologic state and after ischemia, and modulates post-ischemic recovery of neurologic function. To address these important questions, we used a SUMO1-3 knockdown (SUMO-KD) mouse in which a Thy-1 promoter drives expression of 3 distinct microRNAs against SUMO1-3 to silence SUMO expression specifically in neurons. Wild-type and SUMO-KD mice were subjected to transient forebrain ischemia. Microarray analysis was performed in hippocampal CA1 samples, and neurologic function was evaluated. SUMOylation had opposite effects on neuronal gene expression before and after ischemia. In the physiological state, most genes regulated by SUMOylation were up-regulated in SUMO-KD compared to wild-type mice. Brain ischemia/reperfusion significantly modulated the expression levels of more than 400 genes in wild-type mice, with a majority of those genes upregulated. The extent of this post-ischemic transcriptome change was suppressed in SUMO-KD mice. Moreover, SUMO-KD mice exhibited significantly worse functional outcome. This suggests that suppression of global gene expression response in post-ischemic brain due to SUMO knockdown has a negative effect on post-ischemic neurologic function. Together, our data provide a basis for future studies to mechanistically link SUMOylation to neurologic function in health and disease.

When faced with difficult decisions, people prefer to stay with the default. This status quo bias often leads to suboptimal choice behavior. Neurophysiological evidence suggests a pivot role of the Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) for overcoming such status quo bias in difficult decisions, but causal evidence is lacking. The present study investigated whether subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) influences the status quo bias.

Eighteen PD patients treated with STN-DBS performed a difficult perceptual decision task incorporating intrinsic status quo option. Patients were tested with (ON) and without (OFF) active STN stimulation.

Our results show that DBS of the STN affected perceptual decision making in PD patients depending on the difficulty of decision. STN-DBS improved difficult perceptual decisions due to a selective increase in accuracy (hit rate) that was independent of response bias (no effect on false alarm rate). Furthermore, STN-DBS impacted status quo bias as a function of baseline impulsivity. In impulsive patients, STN-DBS increased the default bias, whereas in less impulsive PD patients, DBS of the STN reduced the status quo bias.

In line with our hypothesis, STN-DBS selectively affected the tendency to stick with the default option on difficult decisions, and promoted increased decision accuracy. Moreover, we demonstrate the impact of baseline cognitive abilities on DBS-related performance changes in PD patients.

AB  - Abstract
While deficits in imitation had been reported in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), its exact nature remains unclear. A dysfunction in mirroring mechanisms (through action imitation) has been proposed by some studies to explain this, although some recent evidence points against this hypothesis. The current study used behavior and functional MRI to examine the integrated functioning of the regions that are considered part of the Action Imitation network (AIN) in children and adolescents with ASD during a motor imitation task. Fourteen ASD and 15 age-and-IQ-matched typically developing (TD) children were asked to imitate a series of hand gestures in the MRI scanner. Intact performance on imitation (accurate imitation of hand gestures outside the scanner) in both ASD and TD groups was accompanied by significantly lower activity in ASD participants, relative to TD, in right angular gyrus, precentral gyrus, and left middle cingulate. In addition, autism traits were found to be significantly correlated with activation in the right angular gyrus. Overall, the findings of this study support the role of AIN in imitation and a potential difference in the recruitment of this network in ASD children.

AB  - Abstract
The central canal along the spinal cord (SC.) and medulla is characterized by the presence of a specific population of neurons that contacts the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These medullo-spinal CSF-contacting neurons (CSF-cNs) are identified by the selective expression of the polycystin kidney disease 2-like 1 ionic channel (PKD2L1 or polycystin-L). In adult, they have been shown to express doublecortin (DCX) and Nkx6.1, two markers of juvenile neurons along with the neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN) typically expressed in mature neurons. They were therefore suggested to remain in a rather incomplete maturation state. The aim of this study was to assess whether such juvenile state is stable in postnatal animals or whether CSF-cNs may reach maturity at older stages than neurons in the parenchyma. We show, in the cervical SC. and the brainstem that, in relation to age, CSF-cN density declines and that their cell bodies become more distant from the cc, except in its ventral part. Moreover, in adults (from 1 month) by comparison with neonatal mice, we show that CSF-cNs have evolved to a more mature state, as indicated by the increase in the percentage of cells positive for NeuN and of its level of expression. In parallel, CSF-cNs exhibit, in adult, lower DCX immunoreactivity and do not express PSA-NCAM and TUC4, two neurogenic markers. Nevertheless, CSF-cNs still share in adult characteristics of juvenile neurons such as the presence of phospho-CREB and DCX while NeuN expression remained low. This phenotype persists in 12-month-old animals. Thus, despite a pursuit of neuronal maturation during the postnatal period, CSF-cNs retain a durable low differentiated state.

AB  - Abstract
Normal aging is associated with low-grade neuroinflammation that results from age-related priming of microglial cells. Further, aging alters the response to several anti-inflammatory factors, including interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13. One intervention that has been shown to modulate microglia activation in the aged brain, both basally and following an immune challenge, is exercise. However, whether engaging in exercise can improve responsiveness to anti-inflammatory cytokines is presently unknown. The current study evaluated whether prior exercise training increases sensitivity to anti-inflammatory cytokines that promote the M2 (alternative) microglia phenotype in adult (5-month-old) and aged (23-month-old) C57BL/6J mice. After 8 weeks of exercise or control housing, mice received bilateral hippocampal injections of an IL-4/IL-13 cocktail or vehicle. Twenty-four hours later hippocampal samples were collected and analyzed for expression of genes associated with the M1 (inflammatory) and M2 microglia phenotypes. Results show that IL-4/IL-13 administration increased expression of the M2-associated genes found in inflammatory zone 1 (Fizz1), chitinase-like 3 (Ym1), Arginase-1 (Arg1), SOCS1, IL-1ra, and CD206. In response to IL-4/IL-13 administration, aged mice showed increased hippocampal expression of the M2-related genes Arg1, SOCS1, Ym1, and CD206 relative to adult mice. Aged mice also showed increased expression of IL-1β relative to adults, which was unaffected by wheel running or IL-4/IL-13. Wheel running was found to have modest effects on expression of Ym1 and Fizz1 in aged and adult mice. Collectively, our findings indicate that aged mice show a differential response to anti-inflammatory cytokines relative to adult mice and that exercise has limited effects on modulating this response.

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a key role in cognitive functions, memory, and attention. Alterations in parvalbumin interneurons (PV neurons) and perineuronal nets (PNNs) within the PFC have been implicated in schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder pathology. However, it remains unclear why PV neurons and PNNs in the PFC are selectively impaired. Here we aimed to clarify if PV neurons and PNNs in the PFC have region-specific features. We found that PV neurons and PNNs were increased in a region-specific manner in the PFC during postnatal development. In the mature PFC, the expression of PV protein is lower than in other parts of the cortex. Furthermore, PNNs in the mature PFC are not typical lattice-like structures and do not have the major components of PNNs and tenascin-R. The present study indicates that PV neurons and PNNs have region-specific features, and our results suggest that PV neurons and PNNs have structural vulnerability within the PFC.

Aim: We compared the efficacy of a modified truncated 24-aa peptide (TFP5), derived from the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5)-activating cofactor p35, with mild hypothermia (MH), and determined whether the efficacy of TFP5 is affected by MH. Methods: Ischemic stroke was induced in adult male Sprague–Dawley rats for 2 h. Immediately after initiating reperfusion, TFP5, MH, or the combination of the two were administrated. 48 h after reperfusion, neurological outcomes were evaluated. Results: Rats that received either MH, TFP5, or the combined treatment showed smaller brain infarct size than normothermia control (NT), and there was no apparent difference among these three treatment groups. The neurological deficit was significantly improved only by the combined treatment. MH or TFP5 ameliorated the blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption in ischemic regions with similar efficacy, whereas the combination of them had a trend toward better effect. Besides, the cleavage of p35 into p25 and apoptosis in ischemic regions was inhibited by TFP5 or the combination, but not by MH alone. Conclusions: TFP5 is comparable to MH in improving neurological outcomes in early-stage adult ischemic stroke. When TFP5 is given along with MH, less neurological deficit tends to be achieved.

AB  - Abstract
Self-organized criticality (SoC), a spontaneous dynamic state established and maintained in networks of moderate complexity, is a universal characteristic of neural systems. Such systems produce cascades of spontaneous activity that are typically characterized by power-law distributions and rich, stable spatiotemporal patterns (i.e., neuronal avalanches). Since the dynamics of the critical state confer advantages in information processing within neuronal networks, it is of great interest to determine how criticality emerges during development. One possible mechanism is developmental, and includes axonal elongation during synaptogenesis and subsequent synaptic pruning in combination with the maturation of GABAergic inhibition (i.e., the integration then fragmentation process). Because experimental evidence for this mechanism remains inconclusive, we studied the developmental variation of neuronal avalanches in dissociated cortical neurons using high-density complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) microelectrode arrays (MEAs). The spontaneous activities of nine cultures were monitored using CMOS MEAs from 4 to 30 days in vitro (DIV) at single-cell spatial resolution. While cells were immature, cultures demonstrated random-like patterns of activity and an exponential avalanche size distribution; this distribution was followed by a bimodal distribution, and finally a power-law-like distribution. The bimodal distribution was associated with a large-scale avalanche with a homogeneous spatiotemporal pattern, while the subsequent power-law distribution was associated with diverse patterns. These results suggest that the SoC emerges through a two-step process: the integration process accompanying the characteristic large-scale avalanche and the fragmentation process associated with diverse middle-size avalanches.

AB  - Abstract
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a common method to modulate cortical activity. Anodal tDCS is usually associated with an enhancement of the stimulated brain area, whereas cathodal tDCS is often described as inhibitory brain stimulation method. Our aim was to investigate whether this canonical assumption derived from the motor system could be transferred to the semantic system. Three groups with 20 healthy subjects each were stimulated at Wernicke’s area with either anodal, cathodal or sham tDCS. Subsequently, they performed a simple lexical decision task for a duration of about 25 min. Subjects receiving anodal tDCS revealed faster reaction times (RTs) compared to the sham group, although not reaching statistical significance. Surprisingly, in the cathodal group RTs were decreased significantly. All subjects were faster in the second half of the task, but the tDCS-induced improvement lasted for the entire duration of the task. Error rates were not influenced by tDCS, neither were RTs in a choice reaction time task. Thus, both anodal and cathodal tDCS applied to Wernicke’s area improved semantic processing. Recently, a meta-analysis revealed that the canonical anodal excitation and cathodal inhibition assumption is observed rarely in cognitive studies. In particular, an inhibitory effect of cathodal tDCS on cognition is rare. Our findings thus support the speculation, that especially language functions could be somewhat ‘immune’ to cathodal inhibition.

AB  - Abstract
Freezing of gait (FoG) in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an environmentally sensitive, intermittent problem that occurs most often during turning. FoG is difficult for clinicians to evaluate and treat because it can be difficult to elicit during a clinical visit. Here, we aimed to develop a clinically valid objective measure of freezing severity during a 2-min 360-degree turning-in-place.

Twenty-eight subjects with PD (16 freezers, FoG+, and 12 nonfreezers, FoG−) in the “off” state and 14 healthy control subjects were tested. Subjects wore three inertial sensors (one on each shin and one on the waist) while (1) turning in place for 2 min (alternating 360 degrees to the right with 360 degrees to the left) and (2) performing an Instrumented 7-m Timed Up and Go test (ITUG). Performance was videotaped, and clinical severity of FoG was independently rated by two movement disorders specialists (co-authors).

Turning in place consistently resulted in FoG (13 out of 16 subjects with PD) while FoG was clinically observed in only two subjects with PD during the ITUG test. The Freezing Ratio during the turning test was significantly correlated with the clinical ratings (ρ = 0.7, p = 0.003) and with score on the new FoG questionnaire (ρ = 0.5, p = 0.03). After correcting for symptom severity (UPDRS-III), out of the four objective measures of the turning test (total number of turns, average turn peak speed and average turn smoothness), only the Freezing Ratio was significantly different across groups (p = 0.04).

AB  - Abstract
Brain manganese deposition is led by liver dysfunction and/or portal-systemic shunting in minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE). Manganese is toxic and can cause cognitive disorders and extrapyramidal symptoms. Thus, reduction of manganese intake might be considered as a potential treatment strategy for MHE. In this study we aimed to investigate whether low- or no-manganese feed can improve the neuropsychological manifestations in MHE rats. Rats with MHE were established by partially ligating the portal vein and fed a manganese diet (MHE-M, 10 mg per kg feed; n = 24), a no-manganese diet (MHE-N; n = 24) and a half-manganese diet (MHE-H; n = 24) for 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks, with six rats in each subgroup. Morris water maze (MWM), open-field test and narrow beam test (NBT) were used to evaluate the cognitive and locomotor situations. Fasted blood ammonia, manganese content and glutamine synthetase (GS) activity in basal ganglia and cortex were measured. A significantly longer MWM escape latency, less locomotor activity, longer NBT latency and total time, higher blood ammonia, higher brain manganese content and GS activity were found in MHE-M rats. However, a significantly shorter MWM escape latency, increased locomotor activity, shorter NBT latency and total time, lower blood ammonia, lower brain manganese content and lower GS activity were found in MHE-N rats after no-manganese feed treatment. Partial improvements were found in MHE rats with half-manganese feed treatment. Reduction of manganese intake can significantly improve the cognitive and locomotor situations in MHE rats by reducing brain manganese content and regulating GS activity.

AB  - Abstract
Expressive suppression is a kind of emotion regulation strategies by suppressing behaviors related to emotional responding. Despite the amount of behavioral research on expressive suppression, the structural and functional mechanisms underlying the interaction between gender and expressive suppression in Chinese healthy subjects have remained unknown. In the current study, we assessed the levels of expressive suppression and acquired the structural and functional imaging data from 273 Chinese individuals. A nearly automatic cortical processing technique was used to calculate cortical thickness for each subject. The results from cortical thickness analyses revealed a significant interaction between gender and expressive suppression in the superior frontal gyrus. Then, we conducted the whole-brain functional connectivity analysis with the seed of the superior frontal gyrus to explore the functionally related regions of brain. Subsequent analysis of the interaction between gender and expressive suppression indicated a significant functional connectivity between the superior frontal gyrus and default mode network (DMN) core regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus and parahippocampal gyrus. Our results provided the robust empirical evidence illustrating the role of the superior frontal gyrus and DMN in gender difference of expressive suppression among the Chinese population. These findings might have implications for understanding gender difference in emotion processing and regulation.

AB  - Abstract
Global klotho overexpression extends lifespan while global klotho-deficiency shortens it. As well, klotho protein manipulations inversely regulate cognitive function. Mice without klotho develop rapid onset cognitive impairment before they are 2 months old. Meanwhile, adult mice overexpressing klotho show enhanced cognitive function, particularly in hippocampal-dependent tasks. The cognitive enhancing effects of klotho extend to humans with a klotho polymorphism that increases circulating klotho and executive function. To affect cognitive function, klotho could act in or on the synapse to modulate synaptic transmission or plasticity. However, it is not yet known if klotho is located at synapses, and little is known about its effects on synaptic function. To test this, we fractionated hippocampi and detected klotho expression in both pre and post-synaptic compartments. We find that loss of klotho enhances both pre and post-synaptic measures of CA1 hippocampal synaptic plasticity at 5 weeks of age. However, a rapid loss of synaptic enhancement occurs such that by 7 weeks, when mice are cognitively impaired, there is no difference from wild-type controls. Klotho overexpressing mice show no early life effects on synaptic plasticity, but decreased CA1 hippocampal long-term potentiation was measured at 6 months of age. Together these data suggest that klotho affects cognition, at least in part, by regulating hippocampal synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Abstract
HYBID (HYaluronan Binding Protein Involved in hyaluronan [HA] Depolymerization, KIAA1199) is one of the HA binding proteins that is involved in the depolymerization of HA. HYBID mRNA is highly expressed in the brain, however, the role of HYBID in the brain remains unclear. In this study, we bred Hybid knock-out (KO) mice and evaluated the function of Hybid in the central nervous system. Hybid mRNA was expressed in the brain, especially in the hippocampus and cerebellum, in wild-type mice. Hybid KO mice demonstrated decreased mnemonic ability in novel object recognition and Morris water maze tests. The average molecular mass of hippocampal HA increased in KO mice, accompanied by a significant increase in the total HA amount. Hybid KO mice did not differ in behavior from wild-type mice in the open field test, evaluation of acoustic startle responses, or drug-induced seizure test. In real-time PCR, Hyal1 and Hyal2 mRNA levels, which code hyaluronidases 1 and 2, respectively, did not differ between the Hybid KO and wild-type mouse brain. These results indicate that Hybid plays a key role in memory function in the brain.

AB  - Abstract
Neurons in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of adult animals exhibit short-term plasticity of frequency selectivity and tonotopic organization in behavioral contexts ranging from classical conditioning to attention tasks. However, it is still largely unknown whether short-term plasticity of spatial tuning takes place in A1 of adult animals and whether this spatial turning plasticity in A1 of adults is mediated by medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) as there are reciprocal connection between mPFC and auditory cortex (AC). In the present study, we used extracellular recordings to test whether azimuth tuning in A1 of anesthetized rats can be reshaped by repeated sound stimuli at neurons’ non-preferred azimuth. We also identified whether and how such A1 azimuth tuning plasticity was modulated by the neural activities of mPFC. Our results showed that A1 neurons in adult rats have azimuth tuning plasticity when repeated acoustic stimuli were delivered at the azimuth with a deviation by less than 15° from the best azimuth (BA). The BA shifted toward the exposure azimuth when repeated acoustic stimuli were played for 20–60 min and plasticity decayed within one hour. The less the angle deviated from the BA, the shorter exposure time and longer decay time were required to induce azimuth tuning plasticity. Neural activity in mPFC modulated azimuth tuning plasticity of A1 neurons as reflected by the shorter induction time when mPFC was activated by focal electrical stimulation and the longer induction time when mPFC was inactivated by drug application. Our results suggest that spatial location selectivity in A1 neurons remains plastic in mature animals and that short-term plasticity of spatial tuning can be modulated by the neural activities of mPFC.

AB  - Abstract
Optic flow provides visual self-motion information and is shown to modulate gait and provoke postural reactions. We have previously reported an increased reliance on the visual, as opposed to the somatosensory-based egocentric, frame of reference (FoR) for spatial orientation with age. In this study, we evaluated FoR reliance for self-motion perception with respect to the ground surface. We examined how effects of ground optic flow direction on posture may be enhanced by an intermittent podal contact with the ground, and reliance on the visual FoR and aging. Young, middle-aged and old adults stood quietly (QS) or stepped in place (SIP) for 30 s under static stimulation, approaching and receding optic flow on the ground and a control condition. We calculated center of pressure (COP) translation and optic flow sensitivity was defined as the ratio of COP translation velocity over absolute optic flow velocity: the visual self-motion quotient (VSQ). COP translation was more influenced by receding flow during QS and by approaching flow during SIP. In addition, old adults drifted forward while SIP without any imposed visual stimulation. Approaching flow limited this natural drift and receding flow enhanced it, as indicated by the VSQ. The VSQ appears to be a motor index of reliance on the visual FoR during SIP and is associated with greater reliance on the visual and reduced reliance on the egocentric FoR. Exploitation of the egocentric FoR for self-motion perception with respect to the ground surface is compromised by age and associated with greater sensitivity to optic flow.

AB  - Abstract
Synaptic pruning underlies the transition from an immature to an adult CNS through refinements of neuronal circuits. Our recent study indicates that pubertal synaptic pruning is triggered by the inhibition generated by extrasynaptic α4βδ GABAA receptors (GABARs) which are increased for 10 d on dendritic spines of CA1 pyramidal cells at the onset of puberty (PND 35–44) in the female mouse, suggesting α4βδ GABARs as a novel target for the regulation of adolescent synaptic pruning. In the present study we used a pharmacological approach to further examine the role of these receptors in altering spine density during puberty of female mice and the impact of these changes on spatial learning, assessed in adulthood. Two drugs were chronically administered during the pubertal period (PND 35–44): the GABA agonist gaboxadol (GBX, 0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), to enhance current gated by α4βδ GABARs and the neurosteroid/stress steroid THP (3α-OH-5β-pregnan-20-one, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) to decrease expression of α4βδ. Spine density was determined on PND 56 with Golgi staining. Spatial learning and relearning were assessed using the multiple object relocation task and an active place avoidance task on PND 56. Pubertal GBX decreased spine density post-pubertally by 70% (P &lt; 0.05), while decreasing α4βδ expression with THP increased spine density by twofold (P &lt; 0.05), in both cases, with greatest effects on the mushroom spines. Adult relearning ability was compromised in both hippocampus-dependent tasks after pubertal administration of either drug. These findings suggest that an optimal spine density produced by α4βδ GABARs is necessary for optimal cognition in adults.

AB  - Abstract
Single steps in different directions are often used for postural corrections. However, our knowledge about the neural mechanisms underlying their generation is scarce. This study was aimed to characterize the corrective steps generated in response to disturbances of the basic body configuration caused by forward, backward or outward displacement of the hindlimb, as well as to reveal location in the CNS of the corrective step generating mechanisms. Video recording of the motor response to translation of the supporting surface under the hindlimb along with contact forces and activity of back and limb muscles was performed in freely standing intact and in fixed postmammillary rabbits. In intact rabbits, displacement of the hindlimb in any direction caused a lateral trunk movement toward the contralateral hindlimb, and then a corrective step in the direction opposite to the initial displacement. The time difference between onsets of these two events varied considerably. The EMG pattern in the supporting hindlimb was similar for all directions of corrective steps. It caused the increase in the limb stiffness. EMG pattern in the stepping limb differed in steps with different directions. In postmammillary rabbits the corrective stepping movements, as well as EMG patterns in both stepping and standing hindlimbs were similar to those observed in intact rabbits. This study demonstrates that the corrective trunk and limb movements are generated by separate mechanisms activated by sensory signals from the deviated limb. The neuronal networks generating postural corrective steps reside in the brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons, leading to progressive muscle atrophy and fatal paralysis. Mutations in more than 20 genes, including full-length EphA4 (EphA4-FL), have been implicated in this pathogenesis. The present study aimed to identify novel isoforms of EphA4-FL and to investigate the expression of EphA4-FL and its isoforms in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mutant mouse model of ALS. Two novel transcripts were verified in mouse and humans. In transfected cells, both transcripts could be translated into proteins, which respectively contained the N- and C-termini of EphA4-FL, referred as EphA4-N and EphA4-C. EphA4-N, which was expressed on the surface of transfected cells, was shown to act as a dominant negative receptor by significantly suppressing the activation of EphA4-FL in vitro. The expression of both EphA4-FL and EphA4-N was significantly higher in the nervous tissue of SOD1G93A compared to wild-type mice suggesting that both forms are modulated during the disease process.

AB  - Abstract
Increasing evidence suggests that cardiovascular exercise has positive effects on motor memory consolidation. In this study, we investigated whether a single session of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) mitigates the effects of practicing an interfering motor task. Furthermore, learning and interference effects were assessed in the actively trained and untrained limb as it is known that unilateral motor learning can cause bilateral adaptations.

Subjects performed a ballistic training and then the HIIT either before (HIIT_before) or after (HIIT_after) practicing an interfering accuracy task (AT). The control group (No_HIIT) did not participate in the HIIT but rested instead. Performance in the ballistic task (BT) was tested before and after the ballistic training, after the exercise and practice of the AT and 24 h later. After ballistic training, all groups showed comparable increases in performance in the trained and untrained limb. Despite the practice of the AT, HIIT_before maintained their BT performance after the high-intensity interval training whereas HIIT_after (trend) &amp; No_HIIT showed prominent interference effects. After 24 h, HIIT_before still did not show any interference effects but further improved ballistic motor performance. HIIT_after counteracted the interference resulting in a comparable BT performance after 24 h than directly after the ballistic training while No_HIIT had a significantly lower BT performance in the retention test. The results were similar in the trained and untrained limb. The current results imply that a single session of cardiovascular exercise can prevent motor interference in the trained and untrained hemisphere. Overall learning was best, and interference least, when HIIT was performed before the interfering motor task.

AB  - Abstract
High-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (HF-rTMS) is currently accepted as an evidence-based treatment option for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Additionally, HF-rTMS showed beneficial effects on psychomotor retardation in patients. The classical HF-rTMS paradigms however are unlikely to replace electroconvulsive therapy, a more potent alternative for TRD albeit with important side-effects. Therefore, recent studies have investigated ‘accelerated’ HF-rTMS protocols demonstrating promising clinical responses in patients with TRD. Since the neuronal effects of accelerated HF-rTMS are underinvestigated, we evaluate here the possible metabolic and neurochemical effects of this treatment alternative. More specifically, we measured the effect on brain glucose metabolism and monoamines/metabolites, as well as on the spontaneous motor activity in rats. We found that brain glucose metabolism and monoamines remained generally unaffected after accelerated HF-rTMS, with the exception of reduced total striatal 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (a metabolite of serotonin) levels. Interestingly, when compared to sham stimulation, the velocity, the total distance traveled as well as the percentage of movement, as measured by the open-field test, were significantly enhanced after accelerated HF-rTMS showing an increased motor activity.

Our current results indicate that the accelerated HF-rTMS-induced increase in motor activity in rats, may be related to the striatal neurochemical effect.

The topology of the respiratory network in the brainstem has been addressed using different computational models, which help to understand the functional properties of the system. We tested a neural mass model by comparing the result of activation and inhibition of inhibitory neurons in silico with recently published results of optogenetic manipulation of glycinergic neurons [Sherman, et al. (2015) Nat Neurosci 18:408]. The comparison revealed that a five-cell type model consisting of three classes of inhibitory neurons [I-DEC, E-AUG, E-DEC (PI)] and two excitatory populations (pre-I/I) and (I-AUG) neurons can be applied to explain experimental observations made by stimulating or inhibiting inhibitory neurons by light sensitive ion channels.

AB  - Abstract
The importance of reappraising negative events to reduce negative emotional responses has been widely acknowledged. However, most neuroimaging studies have explored the neural mechanisms of deliberate and intentional reappraisal, while little is known about the neural correlates of reappraisal that occurs outside of one's awareness. Electrophysiological studies suggest that precedent neutral descriptions could implicitly reduce neural responses to unpleasant images. To investigate the neural mechanism underlying implicit reappraisal, functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted on 25 participants while they passively viewed unpleasant images that were previously neutrally/positively or negatively described. Increased activity in prefrontal areas including the dorsolateral and dorsomedial prefrontal cortices, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and temporal cortex, and decreased activation in the amygdala was observed—similar to the pattern reported in deliberate emotion regulation—when unpleasant images were preceded by neutral/positive versus negative descriptions. Functional connectivity analysis revealed significant negative couplings between prefrontal regions and the amygdala. These findings suggest that implicit reappraisal recruits prefrontal regions to change semantic representations in the temporal cortex, in turn modulating the emotional response of the amygdala.

AB  - Abstract
Epilepsy is a neurological disease related to the occurrence of pathological oscillatory activity, but the basic physiological mechanisms of seizure remain to be understood. Our working hypothesis is that specific sensory processing circuits may present abnormally enhanced predisposition for coordinated firing in the dysfunctional brain. Such facilitated entrainment could share a similar mechanistic process as those expediting the propagation of epileptiform activity throughout the brain. To test this hypothesis, we employed the Wistar audiogenic rat (WAR) reflex animal model, which is characterized by having seizures triggered reliably by sound. Sound stimulation was modulated in amplitude to produce an auditory steady-state-evoked response (ASSR; −53.71 Hz) that covers bottom-up and top-down processing in a time scale compatible with the dynamics of the epileptic condition. Data from inferior colliculus (IC) c-Fos immunohistochemistry and electrographic recordings were gathered for both the control Wistar group and WARs. Under 85-dB SLP auditory stimulation, compared to controls, the WARs presented higher number of Fos-positive cells (at IC and auditory temporal lobe) and a significant increase in ASSR-normalized energy. Similarly, the 110-dB SLP sound stimulation also statistically increased ASSR-normalized energy during ictal and post-ictal periods. However, at the transition from the physiological to pathological state (pre-ictal period), the WAR ASSR analysis demonstrated a decline in normalized energy and a significant increase in circular variance values compared to that of controls. These results indicate an enhanced coordinated firing state for WARs, except immediately before seizure onset (suggesting pre-ictal neuronal desynchronization with external sensory drive). These results suggest a competing myriad of interferences among different networks that after seizure onset converge to a massive oscillatory circuit.

AB  - Abstract
A growing body of evidence indicates that impairment of the ubiquitin–proteasome (UPS) system in the substantia nigra (SN) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The aim of our study was to compare two unilateral rat models, one produced by intranigral administration of the UPS inhibitor lactacystin or the other induced by 6-OHDA, in terms of their effect on the amphetamine- and apomorphine-induced rotational behavior, striatal dopamine (DA) D1 and D2 receptor sensitivity and tissue levels of DA and its metabolites. We found that these models did not differ in the intensity of ipsilateral rotations induced by amphetamine. In contrast, apomorphine produced contralateral rotations only in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, and, depending on the dose, it induced either no or moderate ipsilateral rotations in the lactacystin-lesioned group. In addition, lactacystin induced a strong reduction in the tissue DA level and its metabolites in the lesioned striatum and SN when measured three weeks after the administration which was aggravated six weeks post-lesion, reaching the level comparable to the 6-OHDA group. Binding of [3H]raclopride to D2 receptors was increased in the lesioned striatum in both investigated (PD) models six weeks after lesion. In turn, binding of [3H]SCH23390 to the striatal D1 receptors was not changed in the lactacystin group but was increased bilaterally in the 6-OHDA group. The present results add a new value to the study of DA receptor sensitivity and are discussed in the context of the validity of the lactacystin model as a suitable model of Parkinson’s disease.

AB  - Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental brain disorder characterized by restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, social and communication defects, and is commonly associated with difficulties with motor coordination. The etiology of ASD, while mostly idiopathic, has been linked to hereditary factors and teratogens, such as valproic acid (VPA). VPA is used clinically to treat epilepsy, mood disorders, and in the prevention of migraines. The use of VPA during pregnancy significantly increases the risk of ASD in the offspring. Neuropathological studies show decreased cerebellar function in patients with ASD, resulting in gait, balance and coordination impairments. Herein, we have exposed pregnant rats to a repeated oral dose of VPA on embryonic days 10 and 12 and performed a detailed investigation of the structure and function of the cerebellar vermis. We found that throughout all ten lobules of the cerebellar vermis, Purkinje cells were significantly smaller and expression of the calcium binding protein calbindin (CB) was significantly reduced. We also found that dendritic arbors of Purkinje cells were shorter and less complex. Additionally, animals exposed to a repeated dose of VPA performed significantly worse in a number of motor tasks, including beam walking and the rotarod. These results suggest that repeated embryonic exposure to VPA induces significant cerebellar dysfunction and is an effective animal model to study the cerebellar alterations in ASD.

AB  - Abstract
The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) and its activation of the sphingomyelin signaling cascade are essential for mechanical hypersensitivity resulting from locally injected nerve growth factor (NGF). Here the roles of the same effectors, and of the tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) receptor, are evaluated for thermal hyperalgesia from NGF. Sensitivity of rat hind paw plantar skin to thermal stimulation after local sub-cutaneous injection of NGF (500 ng) was measured by the latency for paw withdrawal (PWL) from a radiant heat source. PWL was reduced from baseline values at 0.5–22 h by ∼40% from that in naïve or vehicle-injected rats, and recovered to pre-injection levels by 48 h. Local pre-injection with a p75NTR blocking antibody did not affect the acute thermal hyperalgesia (0.5–3.5 h) but hastened its recovery so that it had reversed to baseline by 22 h. In addition, GW4869 (2 mM), an inhibitor of the neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase) that is an enzyme in the p75NTR pathway, also failed to prevent thermal hyperalgesia. However, C2-ceramide, an analog of the ceramide produced by sphingomyelinase, did cause thermal hyperalgesia. Injection of an anti-TrkA antibody known to promote dimerization and activation of that receptor, independent of NGF, also caused thermal hyperalgesia, and prevented the further reduction of PWL from subsequently injected NGF. A non-specific inhibitor of tropomyosin receptor kinases, K252a, prevented thermal hyperalgesia from NGF, but not that from the anti-TrkA antibody. These findings suggest that the TrkA receptor has a predominant role in thermal hypersensitivity induced by NGF, while p75NTR and its pathway intermediates serve a modulatory role.

AB  - Abstract
Equivocal evidence indicates that high-intensity muscle contractions can affect the corticospinal responses in muscles not directly involved in the task. In the present study, the responsiveness of corticomotor pathway innervating non-dominant biceps brachii was measured in eleven healthy participants before and after: (i) two 100-s isometric unilateral knee extension maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) on dominant leg (FATIGUE) and (ii) rest (CONTROL). Transcranial magnetic stimulation, transmastoid electrical and brachial plexus electrical stimulation were used to evoke motor evoked potential (MEP), cervicomedullary motor evoked potential (CMEP) and compound muscle action potential (Mmax) in biceps brachii muscle. The three stimuli were elicited at 2, 3.5 and 5 s while participants were performing 6-s elbow flexion contractions at 100, 50, and 5% of MVC interspersed with 10-s rest. The results demonstrated opposing behaviors of MEP responses at 100% (23% higher, p = 0.08) and 5% MVC (34% lower, p = 0.019) following FATIGUE compared to CONTROL. Similarly, MEP·CMEP−1 ratio changes indicated that the supraspinal motor response was significantly higher during 100% (42%, p = 0.027) but lower during 5% MVC (28%, p = 0.009) following FATIGUE. Yet, the elbow flexor MVC force did not exhibit any difference between FATIGUE and CONTROL conditions. These results suggest that the upper limb muscles’ corticomotor pathway responsiveness recorded during voluntary contractions were modulated by lower limbs fatiguing contractions and this modulation depends on the force produced during testing, i.e. level of central motor drive. However, these changes have little effect on upper limb muscle maximal performance.

AB  - Abstract
Anoxic depolarization (AD) is an acute event evoked by brain ischemia, involving a profound loss of cell membrane potential and swelling that spreads over susceptible parts of the gray matter. Its occurrence is a strong predictor of the severity of neuronal injury. Little is known about this event in the Substantia Nigra, a midbrain nucleus critical for motor control. We tested the effects of oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), an in vitro model of brain ischemia, in rat midbrain slices. AD developed within 4 min from OGD onset and spread in the Substantia Nigra pars reticulata (SNr), but not through the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNc). This differential effect involved a contrasting pattern of changes in membrane potential between dopamine-producing SNc and non-dopaminergic SNr neurons. A fast depolarization in SNr neurons was not followed by repolarization after the end of OGD, and was associated with swollen somata and beaded dendrites. In contrast, slowly developing depolarization of SNc neurons led to repolarization after OGD ended, and no changes in neuronal morphology were observed. The AD-resistance of the SNc involved smaller dysregulations of K+ and Ca2+ ions, and a slower loss of energy metabolites. Our results show that acute ischemia profoundly impairs the function and morphology of SNr neurons but not adjacent SNc neurons, and that the surprising higher tolerance of SNc neurons correlates with the resistance of the SNc region to AD. This differential response may affect the pattern of early neuronal injury that develops in the brainstem after acute ischemic insults.

AB  - Abstract
The Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome (DS) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) exhibits cognitive impairment and degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs). Our prior studies demonstrated that maternal choline supplementation (MCS) improves attention and spatial cognition in Ts65Dn offspring, normalizes hippocampal neurogenesis, and lessens BFCN degeneration in the medial septal nucleus (MSN). Here we determined whether (i) BFCN degeneration contributes to attentional dysfunction, and (ii) whether the attentional benefits of perinatal MCS are due to changes in BFCN morphology. Ts65Dn dams were fed either a choline-supplemented or standard diet during pregnancy and lactation. Ts65Dn and disomic (2N) control offspring were tested as adults (12–17 months of age) on a series of operant attention tasks, followed by morphometric assessment of BFCNs. Ts65Dn mice demonstrated impaired learning and attention relative to 2N mice, and MCS significantly improved these functions in both genotypes. We also found, for the first time, that the number of BFCNs in the nucleus basalis of Meynert/substantia innominata (NBM/SI) was significantly increased in Ts65Dn mice relative to controls. In contrast, the number of BFCNs in the MSN was significantly decreased. Another novel finding was that the volume of BFCNs in both basal forebrain regions was significantly larger in Ts65Dn mice. MCS did not normalize any of these morphological abnormalities in the NBM/SI or MSN. Finally, correlational analysis revealed that attentional performance was inversely associated with BFCN volume, and positively associated with BFCN density. These results support the lifelong attentional benefits of MCS for Ts65Dn and 2N offspring and have profound implications for translation to human DS and pathology attenuation in AD.

AB  - Abstract
Huntingtin-associated protein 1 (HAP1) is a neuronal interactor with causatively polyglutamine (polyQ)-expanded huntingtin in Huntington’s disease and also associated with pathologically polyQ-expanded androgen receptor (AR) in spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), being considered as a protective factor against neurodegenerative apoptosis. In normal brains, it is abundantly expressed particularly in the limbic-hypothalamic regions that tend to be spared from neurodegeneration, whereas the areas with little HAP1 expression, including the striatum, thalamus, cerebral neocortex and cerebellum, are targets in several neurodegenerative diseases. While the spinal cord is another major neurodegenerative target, HAP1-immunoreactive (ir) structures have yet to be determined there. In the current study, HAP1 expression was immunohistochemically evaluated in light and electron microscopy through the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spinal cords of the adult male rat. Our results showed that HAP1 is specifically expressed in neurons through the spinal segments and that more than 90% of neurons expressed HAP1 in lamina I–II, lamina X, and autonomic preganglionic regions. Double-immunostaining for HAP1 and AR demonstrated that more than 80% of neurons expressed both in laminae I-II and X. In contrast, HAP1 was specifically lacking in the lamina IX motoneurons with or without AR expression. The present study first demonstrated that HAP1 is abundantly expressed in spinal neurons of the somatosensory, viscerosensory, and autonomic regions but absent in somatomotor neurons, suggesting that the spinal motoneurons are, due to lack of putative HAP1 protectivity, more vulnerable to stresses in neurodegenerative diseases than other HAP1-expressing neurons probably involved in spinal sensory and autonomic functions.

AB  - Abstract
Lateral habenula (LHb) is important for emotional processing. It is a link node between forebrain and midbrain. LHb is reciprocally connected with ventral tegmental area, acting as a regulatory center for the dopaminergic system. However, the role of dopamine receptors in the LHb in emotional processing is less clear. In the present study, the expression of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in LHb was testified by western blot. In addition, D1- or D2-like receptor agonist or antagonist was bilaterally administered into the LHb, anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors were tested 15 min later in rats. In addition, the effects of LHb dopamine receptor activation and inactivation on aversive learning and memory were assessed. Our results showed that: (1) activation and inhibition of D1R but not D2R in LHb increased anxiety-like behavior but decreased depressive-like behavior in rats. (2) D1R activation and inactivation in LHb impaired aversive memory acquisition but not consolidation in rats, D1R agonist also impaired aversive memory retrieval in rats. These results might provide new clues about how LHb was involved in emotional processing.

AB  - Abstract
Although it is still debated whether vasoconstriction underlies migraine resolution by triptans, they are not recommended in patients at cardiovascular risk. However, relationship between stroke incidence and triptan use is unclear, and it is unknown whether acute or chronic use of these drugs worsens ischemic brain injury. To address this issue, we investigated the effect of clinically-relevant doses of the potent cerebral artery vasoconstrictor eletriptan on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and brain infarct volumes, as well as on expression of genes involved in cerebrovascular regulation. We report that acute treatment of rats or mice with eletriptan did not reduce basal CBF, which promptly dropped upon treatment with prazosin or dihydroergotamine. Acute of chronic (1 month) eletriptan also did not affect CBF changes and infarct volumes in mice undergoing brain ischemia/reperfusion. Finally, chronic eletriptan reduced brain mRNAs for PACAP and VIP, leaving unaffected those for 5HT1B/DR and CGRP. No significant transcript changes were found in dura mater. Data suggest that the impact of triptans on cerebral hemodynamic should be re-evaluated, as well as their propensity to increase stroke risk in migraineurs.

AB  - Abstract
Our former study demonstrated that Krüppel-like Factor 7 (KLF7) is a transcription factor that stimulates axonal regeneration after peripheral nerve injury. Currently, we used a gene therapy approach to overexpress KLF7 in Schwann cells (SCs) and assessed whether KLF7-transfected SCs graft could promote sciatic nerve regeneration. SCs were transfected by adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2)-KLF7 in vitro. Mice were allografted by an acellular nerve (ANA) with either an injection of DMEM (ANA group), SCs (ANA + SCs group) or AAV2-KLF7-transfected SCs (ANA + KLF7-SCs group) to assess repair of a sciatic nerve gap. The results indicate that KLF7 overexpression promoted the proliferation of both transfected SCs and native SCs. The neurite length of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) explants was enhanced. Several beneficial effects were detected in the ANA + KLF7-SCs group including an increase in the compound action potential amplitude, sciatic function index score, enhanced expression of PKH26-labeling transplant SCs, peripheral myelin protein 0, neurofilaments, S-100, and myelinated regeneration nerve. Additionally, HRP-labeled motoneurons in the spinal cord, CTB-labeled sensory neurons in the DRG, motor endplate density and the weight ratios of target muscles were increased by the treatment while thermal hyperalgesia was diminished. Finally, expression of KLF7, NGF, GAP43, TrkA and TrkB were enhanced in the grafted SCs, which may indicate that several signal pathways may be involved in conferring the beneficial effects from KLF7 overexpression. We concluded that KLF7-overexpressing SCs promoted axonal regeneration of the peripheral nerve and enhanced myelination, which collectively proved KLF-SCs as a novel therapeutic strategy for injured nerves.

AB  - Abstract
Nonsynaptic mechanism changes, particularly the enhancement of NKCC1 expression in the dentate gyrus (DG) after 4 weeks of ethanol consumption, motivate the present work, in which rats were submitted to a period of chronic consumption (12 weeks). Four groups of six animals (6-week-old male Wistar rats) were formed, including the control (C), ethanol 1 (E1), ethanol 2 (E2) and ethanol 3 (E3) groups. The rats in the E1, E2 and E3 groups were treated daily with a 30% v/v solution of ethanol, administered via oral gavage (1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 g/kg, respectively). Nonsynaptic epileptiform activities (NEA) were induced by means of the zero-Ca2+ and high-K+ model using hippocampal slices and were recorded in the DG. The presence of NKCC1, KCC2, α1-Na+/K+-ATPase and GFAP immunoreactivity was analyzed. The results demonstrate that alcohol consumption changes NEA, and these changes are more prominent at the lower dosage. An increase in the DC shifts associated with epileptiform discharges was present with the low dose. This increase was correlated with the increment of NKCC1 expression. Confocal microscopy images indicate the NKCC1 increase was pronounced in the initial axonal segment of granule cells. The blockage of these cotransporters during NEA induction with bumetanide suppressed the DC shift increase and diminished all parameters of NEA that were quantified for all groups treated with ethanol. Therefore, the increase in NKCC1 expression and the effective activity of this cotransporter, which were observed in the treated groups, suggest that drugs that act for block NKCC1 represent promising strategies for diminishing the effects of alcohol damage on the brain.

AB  - Abstract
After peripheral nerve injury, transected fibers distal to the lesion are disconnected from the neuronal body. This results in target denervation but also massive stripping of the central synapses of axotomized motoneurons, disrupting spinal circuits. Even when axonal regeneration is successful, the non-specific target reinnervation and the limited rebuilding of spinal circuits impair functional recovery. Therefore, strategies aimed to preserve spinal circuits after nerve lesions may improve the functional outcome. Activity-dependent therapy in the form of early treadmill running reduces synaptic stripping, mainly of excitatory synapses, and the disorganization of perineuronal nets (PNNs) on axotomized motoneurons. The mechanism underlying these effects remains unknown, although the benefits of exercise are often attributed to an increase in the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In this study, tropomyosin-related kinase (TrkB) agonist and antagonist were administered to rats subjected to sciatic nerve injury in order to shed light on the role of BDNF. The maintenance of synapses on axotomized motoneurons induced by treadmill running was partially dependent on TrkB activation. Treatment with the TrkB agonist at a low dose, but not at a high dose, prevented the decrease of excitatory glutamatergic synapses, and both doses increased the density of inhibitory synapses. TrkB inactivation counteracted only some of the positive effects exerted by exercise after nerve injury, such as maintenance of excitatory synapses surrounding motoneurons. Therefore, specific regimes of physical exercise are a better strategy to attenuate the alterations that motoneurons suffer after axotomy than pharmacological modulation of the TrkB pathway.

AB  - Abstract
Neuronal gap junctions are ubiquitous in the brain, but their precise positions in actual neuronal circuits have been uncertain, and their functional roles remain unclear. In this study, I visualized connexin36-immunoreactive gap junctions and examined the structural features of the interconnected dendrites arising from parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons in layer 4 of the feline visual cortex. I observed evidence for net-like dense linkages of dendrites among virtually all PV neurons (56/58 cells, 96.6%) in the tissue. This dendritic reticulum established connections among clustered cells and further among remote cells. The latter connectivity exhibited a preference for vertical direction, including translaminar linkages, but was also characterized by lateral continuity. Measurement of the distances from each dendritic gap junction back to the two connected somata revealed that at least one of two somata was within 50 μm from the junction in 77.5% of the cases and within 75 μm in 91.2% of the cases. Thus, distal gap junctions mediated morphologically asymmetrical connection where one soma was close to, but the other soma was far from the connecting junction. This connectivity was typically observed between neurons located apart in the same columnar space, where a long vertical dendrite bridged two neurons through an asymmetrically positioned gap junction. In contrast, gap junctions formed between nearby cells were close to both somata. Thalamocortical afferents established synapses densely on somata of layer 4 PV neurons, indicating the possible involvement of proximal gap junctions in visual stimulus-driven feedforward regulation. These findings provide a new structural basis for cortical investigations.

AB  - Abstract
Deregulation of glutamate homeostasis is associated with degenerative neurological disorders. Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) is important for glutamate metabolism and plays a central role in expanding the pool of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG), which improves overall bioenergetics. Under high energy demand, maintenance of ATP production results in functionally active mitochondria. Here, we tested whether the modulation of GDH activity can rescue ischemia/reperfusion-induced neuronal death in an in vivo mouse model of middle artery occlusion and an in vitro oxygen/glucose depletion model. Iodoacetate, an inhibitor of glycolysis, was also used in a model of energy failure, remarkably depleting ATP and α-KG. To stimulate GDH activity, the GDH activator 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid and potential activator beta-lapachone were used. The GDH activators restored α-KG and ATP levels in the injury models and provided potent neuroprotection. We also found that beta-lapachone increased glutamate utilization, accompanied by a reduction in extracellular glutamate. Thus, our hypothesis that mitochondrial GDH activators increase α-KG production as an alternative energy source for use in the TCA cycle under energy-depleted conditions was confirmed. Our results suggest that increasing GDH-mediated glutamate oxidation represents a new therapeutic intervention for neurodegenerative disorders, including stoke.

AB  - Abstract
Sandhoff disease (SD) is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the absence of hydrolytic enzyme β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (Hex), which results in storage of GM2 ganglioside in neurons and unremitting neurodegeneration. Neuron loss initially affects fine motor skills, but rapidly progresses to loss of all body faculties, a vegetative state, and death by five years of age in humans. A well-established feline model of SD allows characterization of the disease in a large animal model and provides a means to test the safety and efficacy of therapeutic interventions before initiating clinical trials. In this study, we demonstrate a robust central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory response in feline SD, primarily marked by expansion and activation of the microglial cell population. Quantification of major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) labeling revealed significant up-regulation throughout the CNS with areas rich in white matter most severely affected. Expression of the leukocyte chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1α) was also up-regulated in the brain. SD cats were treated with intracranial delivery of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors expressing feline Hex, with a study endpoint 16 weeks post treatment. AAV-mediated gene delivery repressed the expansion and activation of microglia and normalized MHC-II and MIP-1α levels. These data reiterate the profound inflammatory response in SD and show that neuroinflammation is abrogated after AAV-mediated restoration of enzymatic activity.

AB  - Abstract
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) produce widespread and complex effects on neocortex excitability. We studied how heteromeric nAChRs regulate inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSCs), in fast-spiking (FS) layer V neurons of the mouse frontal area 2 (Fr2). In the presence of blockers of ionotropic glutamate receptors, tonic application of 10 μM nicotine augmented the spontaneous IPSC frequency, with minor alterations of amplitudes and kinetics. These effects were studied since the 3rd postnatal week, and persisted throughout the first two months of postnatal life. The action of nicotine was blocked by 1 μM dihydro-β-erythroidine (DHβE; specific for α4∗ nAChRs), but not 10 nM methyllycaconitine (MLA; specific for α7∗ nAChRs). It was mimicked by 10 nM 5-iodo-3-[2(S)-azetidinylmethoxy]pyridine (5-IA; which activates β2∗ nAChRs). Similar results were obtained on miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs). Moreover, during the first five postnatal weeks, approximately 50% of FS cells displayed DHβE-sensitive whole-cell nicotinic currents. This percentage decreased to ∼5% in mice older than P45. By confocal microscopy, the α4 nAChR subunit was immunocytochemically identified on interneurons expressing either parvalbumin (PV), which mainly labels FS cells, or somatostatin (SOM), which labels the other major interneuron population in layer V. GABAergic terminals expressing α4 were observed to be juxtaposed to PV-positive (PV+) cells. A fraction of these terminals displayed PV immunoreactivity. We conclude that α4β2∗ nAChRs can produce sustained regulation of FS cells in Fr2 layer V. The effect presents a presynaptic component, whereas the somatic regulation decreases with age. These mechanisms may contribute to the nAChR-dependent stimulation of excitability during cognitive tasks as well as to the hyperexcitability caused by hyperfunctional heteromeric nAChRs in sleep-related epilepsy.

AB  - Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. It is generally believed that it is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, but the precise pathogenesis of PD is unknown to date. In this study, we performed a pathway analysis based on genome-wide association study (GWAS) to detect risk pathways of PD in three GWAS datasets. We first mapped all SNP markers to autosomal genes in each GWAS dataset. Then, we evaluated gene risk values using the minimum P-value of the tagSNPs. We took a pathway as a unit to identify the risk pathways based on the cumulative risks of the genes in the pathway. Finally, we combine the analysis results of the three datasets to detect the high risk pathways associated with PD. We found there were five same pathways in the three datasets. Besides, we also found there were five pathways which were shared in two datasets. Most of these pathways are associated with nervous system. Five pathways had been reported to be PD-related pathways in the previous literature. Our findings also implied that there was a close association between immune response and PD. Continued investigation of these pathways will further help us explain the pathogenesis of PD.

AB  - Abstract
In humans, some males experience reductions in testosterone levels, as a natural consequence of aging or in the clinical condition termed hypogonadism, which are associated with impaired cognitive performance and mood disorder(s). Some of these behavioral deficits can be reversed by testosterone treatment. Our previous work in rats reported that sex differences in the expression of the transcription factor Zif268, a downstream target of testosterone, within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) mediates sex differences in social interaction. In the present study, we aimed to examine the effects of gonadectomy (GNX) in male rats on mPFC Zif268 expression, mood and cognitive behaviors. We also examined whether reinstitution of Zif268 in GNX rats will correct some of the behavioral deficits observed following GNX. Our results show that GNX induced a downregulation of Zif268 protein in the mPFC, which was concomitant with impaired memory in the y-maze and spontaneous object recognition test, reduced social interaction time, and depression-like behaviors in the forced swim test. Reinstitution of mPFC Zif268, using a novel adeno-associated-viral (AAV) construct, abrogated GNX-induced working memory and long-term memory impairments, and reductions in social interaction time, but not GNX-induced depression-like behaviors. These findings suggest that mPFC Zif268 exerts beneficial effects on memory and social interaction, and could be a potential target for novel treatments for behavioral impairments observed in hypogonadal and aged men with declining levels of gonadal hormones.

AB  - Abstract
Endocannabinoids and somatostatin (SST) play critical roles in several pathophysiological conditions via binding to different receptor subtypes. Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) and somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) are expressed in several brain regions and share overlapping functions. Whether these two prominent members of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family interact with each other and constitute a functional receptor complex is not known. In the present study, we investigated the colocalization of CB1R and SSTR5 in rat brain, and studied receptor internalization, interaction and signal transduction pathways in HEK-293 cells cotransfected with human cannabinoid receptor 1 (hCB1R) and hSSTR5. Our results showed that CB1R and SSTR5 colocalized in rat brain cortex, striatum, and hippocampus. CB1R was expressed in SSTR5 immunoprecipitate prepared from the brain tissue lysate, indicating their association in a system where these receptors are endogenously expressed. In cotransfected HEK-293 cells, SSTR5 and CB1R existed in a constitutive heteromeric complex under basal condition, which was disrupted upon agonist treatments. Furthermore, concurrent receptor activation led to preferential formation of SSTR5 homodimer and dissociation of CB1R homodimer. We also discovered that second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate and downstream signaling pathways were modulated in a SSTR5-dominant and concentration-dependent manner in the presence of receptor-specific agonist. In conclusion, with predominant role of SSTR5, the functional consequences of crosstalk between SSTR5 and CB1R resulting in the regulation of receptor trafficking and signal transduction pathways open new therapeutic avenue in cancer biology and excitotoxicity.

Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and prostaglandin (PG) D2 are endogenous sleep-promoting substances. Since it was reported that a highly selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, NS398, completely inhibited IL-1β-induced sleep in rats, IL-1β-induced sleep had been believed to be mediated by prostanoids, most probably PGD2. However, in the present study, pretreatment of rats with NS398 (3 mg/kg) did not suppress the 64.2% increased non-rapid eye movement (non-REM, NREM) sleep during infusion of IL-1β (10 ng) for 6 h in the nocturnal (active) period between 23:00 and 5:00 into the subarachnoid space of the PGD2-sensitive sleep-promoting zone of the basal forebrain. Meanwhile, IL-1β at doses of 1.7 and 5 μg/kg also significantly increased NREM sleep for 6 h after intraperitoneal injection at 20:00 (light-off time) by 76.8% and 121.1%, respectively, in wild-type (WT) mice, by 67.7% and 147.3%, respectively, in WT mice pretreated with NS398 (5 mg/kg) and by 108.9% and 121.6%, respectively, in PGD2 receptor (DP1R) knockout mice. These results indicate that IL-1β-induced NREM sleep is independent of the PGD2/DP1R system and other COX-2-derived prostaglandins in rats and mice.

AB  - Abstract
We examined the contribution of the sodium channel isoform Nav1.8 to retinal function using the specific blocker A803467. We found that A803467 has little influence on the electroretinogram (ERG) a- and b-waves, but significantly reduces the oscillatory potentials (OPs) to 40–60% of their original amplitude, with significant changes in implicit time in the rod-driven range. To date, only two cell types were found in mouse to express Nav1.8; the starburst amacrine cells (SBACs), and a subtype of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). When we recorded light responses from ganglion cells using a multielectrode array we found significant and opposing changes in two physiological groups of RGCs. ON-sustained cells showed significant decreases while transient ON-OFF cells showed significant increases. The effects on ON-OFF transient cells but not ON-sustained cells disappeared in the presence of an inhibitory cocktail. We have previously shown that RGCs have only a minor contribution to the OPs (Smith et al., 2014), therefore suggesting that SBACs might be a significant contributor to this ERG component. Targeting SBACs with the cholinergic neurotoxin ethylcholine mustard aziridinium (AF64A) caused a reduction in the amplitude of the OPs similar to A803467. Our results, both using the ERG and MEA recordings from RGCs, suggest that Nav1.8 plays a role in modulating specific aspects of the retinal physiology and that SBACs are a fundamental cellular contributor to the OPs in mice, a clear demonstration of the dichotomy between ERG b-wave and OPs.

AB  - Abstract
Creatine, a compound that is critical for energy metabolism of nervous cells, crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the neuronal plasma membrane with difficulty, and only using its specific transporter. In the hereditary condition where the creatine transporter is defective (creatine transporter deficiency) there is no creatine in the brain, and administration of creatine is useless lacking the transporter. The disease is severe and incurable. Creatine-derived molecules that could cross BBB and plasma membrane independently of the transporter might be useful to cure this condition. Moreover, such molecules could be useful also in stroke and other brain ischemic conditions. In this paper, we investigated three creatine salts, creatine ascorbate, creatine gluconate and creatine glucose. Of these, creatine glucose was ineffective after transporter block with guanidine acetic acid (GPA) administration. Creatine ascorbate was not superior to creatine in increasing tissue creatine and phosphocreatine content after transporter impairment, however even after such impairment it delayed synaptic failure during anoxia. Finally, creatine gluconate was superior to creatine in increasing tissue content of creatine after transporter block and slowed down PS disappearance during anoxia, an effect that creatine did not have. These findings suggest that coupling creatine to molecules having a specific transporter may be a useful strategy in creatine transporter deficiency. In particular, creatine ascorbate has effects comparable to those of creatine in normal conditions, while being superior to it under conditions of missing or impaired creatine transporter.

AB  - Abstract
Recent studies using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) demonstrated that changes in functional connectivity (FC) after stroke correlate with recovery. The aim of this study was to explore whether combining motor learning to dual transcranial direct current stimulation (dual-tDCS, applied over both primary motor cortices (M1)) modulated FC in stroke patients. Twenty-two chronic hemiparetic stroke patients participated in a baseline rs-fMRI session. One week later, dual-tDCS/sham was applied during motor skill learning (intervention session); one week later, the retention session started with the acquisition of a run of rs-fMRI imaging. The intervention + retention sessions were performed once with dual-tDCS and once with sham in a randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled, double-blind design. A whole-brain independent component analysis based analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated no changes between baseline and sham sessions in the somatomotor network, whereas a FC increase was observed one week after dual-tDCS compared to baseline (qFDR &lt;0.05, t63 = 4.15). A seed-based analysis confirmed specific stimulation-driven changes within a network of motor and premotor regions in both hemispheres. At baseline and one week after sham, the strongest FC was observed between the M1 and dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) of the undamaged hemisphere. In contrast, one week after dual-tDCS, the strongest FC was found between the M1 and PMd of the damaged hemisphere. Thus, a single session of dual-tDCS combined with motor skill learning increases FC in the somatomotor network of chronic stroke patients for one week.

AB  - Abstract
The neuropeptide PACAP modulates synaptic transmission in the hippocampus exerting multiple effects through different receptor subtypes: the underlying mechanisms have not yet been completely elucidated. The neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) also exerts a well-documented modulation of hippocampal synaptic transmission and plasticity. Since PACAP was shown to stimulate ACh release in the hippocampus, we tested whether PACAP acting through ACh might indirectly modulate glutamate-mediated synaptic transmission at a pre- and/or at a post-synaptic level. Using patch clamp on rat hippocampal slices, we tested PACAP effects on stimulation-evoked AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCsAMPA) in the CA3-CA1 synapse and on spontaneous miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in CA1 pyramidal neurons. A subnanomolar dose of PACAP (0.5 nM) decreased EPSCsAMPA amplitude, enhanced EPSC paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and reduced mEPSC frequency, indicating a pre-synaptic decrease of glutamate release probability: these effects were abolished by simultaneous blockade of muscarinic and nicotinic ACh receptors, indicating the involvement of endogenous ACh. The effect of subnanomolar PACAP was abolished by a PAC1 receptor antagonist but not by a VPAC receptor blocker. At a higher concentration (10 nM), PACAP inhibited EPSCsAMPA: this effect persisted in the presence of ACh receptor antagonists and did not involve any change in PPF or in mEPSC frequency, thus was not mediated by ACh and was exerted post- synaptically on CA1 pyramidal neurons.

We suggest that a high-affinity PAC1 receptor pre-synaptically modulates hippocampal glutamatergic transmission acting through ACh. Therefore, administration of PACAP at very low doses might be envisaged in cognitive diseases with reduced cholinergic transmission.

AB  - Abstract
Previous research has suggested that balance impairments may be linked to anxiety in PD, yet there is little empirical evidence to support this link in PD. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of anxiety on balance, and also examine whether dopaminergic treatment modulates the influence of anxiety on balance. Forty-two participants (10 high anxious PD [HA–PD]; 11 low anxious PD [LA–PD], 21 controls [HC]) performed 10 quiet standing trials on a force platform in two virtual environments: LOW threat; on a plank located on the ground; HIGH threat; on an elevated plank. After each 30-s trial, participants rated their anxiety. PD participants were tested both ON and OFF dopaminergic medication, and center of gravity (COG) deviations in anterior–posterior (AP) and medio-lateral (ML) directions were recorded. Results showed that all groups reported significantly greater levels of anxiety when standing in the HIGH condition compared to the LOW and HA–PD reported greater levels of anxiety compared to both other groups. All participants significantly reduced their COG position to be closer to center in the ML plane during the HIGH compared to LOW threat condition. HA–PD participants were the only group to reduce their lean significantly in the AP plane while standing in the HIGH compared to the LOW condition. HA–PD participants also had significantly greater variability in the COG displacement in both the AP and ML planes compared to LA–PD participants. Although dopaminergic medication significantly reduced self-reported anxiety, it had limited effects on balance. In conclusion, this study provides strong evidence that anxiety does influence balance control in PD, especially those who are highly anxious. Dopamine appears to modulate anxiety, but further research is needed to evaluate whether dopaminergic treatment is optimal for anxiety induced balance deficits.

AB  - Abstract
Previous studies yielded evidence for an interaction between age and valence in numerous cognitive processes. But, to date, no research has been conducted in the field of motor skills. In this study, we examined the age-related differences in the organization of an emotionally goal-directed locomotion task. Faced with a pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral picture displayed to the side of a stop button, younger and older adults were instructed to walk toward the button (intermediate goal) and push it to turn-off the picture (final goal). Kinematic and ground reaction forces were recorded. The main findings indicated that older adults’ response times (RTs) did not differ across the valence picture. The fastest RTs were found in younger adults when faced with pleasant pictures, suggesting that older people may focus either on intermediate or final goals, depending on their value of pleasantness, and prioritize positive goals. We also found that the spatial coding of locomotion (trajectory and final body position) was affected in the same way by the valence of the intermediate goal in both age groups. Taken together, these findings provide new perspectives regarding the potential role of the emotional valence of the intermediate and final goals on the cognitive processes involved in action coding, such as in mental representations of action in older adults.

AB  - Abstract
GM1 gangliosides (GM1) are acidic glycosphingolipids that are present in cell membranes and lipid raft domains, being particularly abundant in central nervous systems. GM1 participate in modulating cell membrane properties, intercellular recognition, cell regulation, and signaling. We previously demonstrated that GM1 are expressed inside astrocytes but not on the cell surface. We investigated whether the antipsychotic drug haloperidol induces GM1 expression in astrocytes, and found that the expression of GM1 was significantly upregulated by haloperidol in the intracellular vesicles of cultured astrocytes. The effects of haloperidol on GM1 expression acted through the σ1 receptor (σ1R), but not the dopamine-2 receptor. Inhibition of the ERK pathway blocked the induction of GM1 through the σ1R by haloperidol. Interestingly, this increase in GM1 expression induced the accumulation of autophagosomes in astrocytes. Moreover, the effect of haloperidol on the σ1R induced a decrease in GM1 in the cellular membrane of astrocytes. These findings suggested that the effects of haloperidol on the σ1R induced GM1 accumulation in the autophagosomes of astrocytes through activating the ERK pathway and a decrease in GM1 expression on the cell surface.

AB  - Abstract
Cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) and transient receptor potential vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1) receptors may have opposite roles in modulating neural activity and, consequently, in regulating the stress response. These receptors are widely expressed in several brain structures, including the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). The functional consequences of the interaction between CB1 and TRPV1, however, have scarcely been explored. Therefore, we investigated if CB1 and TRPV1 receptors located in the vmPFC would be involved in the behavioral changes induced by the stress of the forced swim test (FST). Rats with cannulae implanted into the vmPFC were given the dual blocker of TRPV1 receptors and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), Arachidonyl serotonin (AA-5HT, 0.125/0.25/0.5 nmol), TRPV1 antagonist, SB366791 (0.5/1/10 nmol), FAAH inhibitor, URB597 (0.001/0.01/0.1/1 nmol), or vehicle and were submitted to the FST, or to the open-field test. Another group received intra-vmPFC injection of SB366791 or vehicle, followed by a second injection of URB597 or vehicle, and was submitted to the FST. Lastly, a group received intra-vmPFC injection of a CB1 antagonist, in sub-effective dose or vehicle, followed by AA-5HT, SB366791 or vehicle. The results showed that AA-5HT, SB366791 and URB597 significantly reduced the immobility time without changing the locomotor activity. Furthermore, the co-administration of URB597 and SB366791 in sub-effective doses induced an antidepressant-like effect in the FST. Additionally, the antidepressant-like effect of AA-5HT was prevented by the CB1 antagonist. Together, these results suggest that both, CB1 and TRPV1 receptors located in the vmPFC are involved in the behavioral responses to stress, although in opposite ways.

AB  - Abstract
Recent evidence indicates the involvement of inflammatory factors and mitochondrial dysfunction in the etiology of psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression. To investigate the possible role of mitochondrial-induced sterile inflammation in the co-occurrence of anxiety and depression, in this study, we treated adult male mice with the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of a single low dose of streptozotocin (STZ, 0.2 mg/mouse). Using valid and qualified behavioral tests for the assessment of depressive and anxiety-like behaviors, we showed that STZ-treated mice exhibited behaviors relevant to anxiety and depression 24 h following STZ treatment. We observed that the co-occurrence of anxiety and depressive-like behaviors in animals were associated with abnormal mitochondrial function, nitric oxide overproduction and, the increased activity of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) in the hippocampus. Further, STZ-treated mice had a significant upregulation of genes associated with the innate immune system such as toll-like receptors 2 and 4. Pathological evaluations showed no sign of neurodegeneration in the hippocampus of STZ-treated mice. Results of this study revealed that behavioral abnormalities provoked by STZ, as a cytotoxic agent that targets mitochondria and energy metabolism, are associated with abnormal mitochondrial activity and, consequently the initiation of innate-inflammatory responses in the hippocampus. Our findings highlight the role of mitochondria and innate immunity in the formation of sterile inflammation and behaviors relevant to anxiety and depression. Also, we have shown that STZ injection (i.c.v.) might be an animal model for depression and anxiety disorders based on sterile inflammation.

AB  - Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenous gasotransmitter with neuroprotective properties that participates in the regulation of transmitter release and neuronal excitability in various brain structures. The role of H2S in the growth and maturation of neural networks however remains unclear. The aim of the present study is to reveal the effects of H2S on neuronal spontaneous activity relevant to neuronal maturation in hippocampal slices of neonatal rats. Sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) (100 μM), a classical donor of H2S produced a biphasic effect with initial activation and subsequent concentration-dependent suppression of network-driven giant depolarizing potentials (GDPs) and neuronal spiking activity. Likewise, the substrate of H2S synthesis l-cysteine (1 mM) induced an initial increase followed by an inhibition of GDPs and spiking activity. Our experiments indicate that the increase in initial discharge activity by NaHS is evoked by neuronal depolarization which is partially mediated by a reduction of outward K+ currents. The subsequent decrease in the neuronal activity by H2S appears to be due to the rightward shift of activation and inactivation of voltage-gated Na+ currents, thus preventing network activity. NaHS also reduced N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated currents, without essential effect on AMPA/kainate or GABAA-mediated currents. Finally, H2S abolished the interictal-like events induced by bicuculline. In summary, our results suggest that through the inhibitory action on voltage-gated Na+ channels and NMDA receptors, H2S prevents the enhanced neuronal excitability typical to early hippocampal networks.

AB  - Abstract
Every spring, deer cast their old antlers and initiate a regeneration process, which yields a new set of antlers of up to 1 m in length. Over the course of three months, branches of the trigeminal nerve, originating from the frontal skull, innervate velvet, a modified skin that covers the regenerating antler. The rate of growth of these axons reaches up to 2 cm per day making them the fastest regenerating axons in adult mammals. Here, we aim to identify the factors secreted by velvet that promote such high speed axon growth. Our experiments with cultures of adult rat trigeminal neurons demonstrate that conditioned medium harvested from velvet organotypic cultures has greater axon growth-promoting properties than a medium conditioned by normal skin. The axon growth-promoting effects of velvet act synergistically with the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein laminin, a component of the basal lamina present in the deer antler. Our proteomic analyses identified several axon growth promoters in the velvet-conditioned medium (VCM), including soluble proteins such as nerve growth factor (NGF) and apolipoprotein A-1, as well as matrix extracellular proteins, such as periostin and SPARC. Additional in vitro analyses allowed us to determine that a synergic relationship between periostin and NGF may contribute to neurite growth-promoting effects of velvet secretome. A combinatorial approach using these factors may promote regeneration at high speeds in patients with peripheral neuropathies.

AB  - Abstract
The interaction of early life stress (ELS) and the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) has been associated with increased risk to develop depression in later life. We have used the maternal separation paradigm as a model for ELS exposure in homozygous and heterozygous 5-HTT knockout rats and measured urocortin 1 (Ucn1) mRNA and/or protein levels, Ucn1 DNA methylation, as well as 5-HT innervation in the centrally projecting Edinger–Westphal (EWcp) and dorsal raphe (DR) nuclei, both implicated in the regulation of stress response. We found that ELS and 5-HTT genotype increased the number of 5-HT neurons in specific DR subdivisions, and that 5-HTT knockout rats showed decreased 5-HT innervation of EWcp-Ucn1 neurons. Furthermore, ELS was associated with increased DNA methylation of the promoter region of the Ucn1 gene and increased expression of 5-HT receptor 1A in the EWcp. In contrast, 5-HTT deficiency was associated with site-specific alterations in DNA methylation of the Ucn1 promoter, and heterozygous 5-HTT knockout rats showed decreased expression of CRF receptor 1 in the EWcp. Together, our findings extend the existing literature on the relationship between EWcp-Ucn1 and DR-5-HT neurons. These observations will further our understanding on their potential contribution to mediate affect as a function of ELS interacting with 5-HTTLPR.

AB  - Abstract
Prematurity and hypoxia–ischemia (HI) can lead to movement disorders in infants. Considering that mild-moderate HI induced at postnatal day (PND) 3 has failed to produce motor disabilities similar to those seen in pre-term newborns, the main goal of the present study was to verify whether longer hypoxia periods would mimic motor function impairment, brain and muscle morphological alterations. Forty-nine Wistar rat pups of both sexes were randomly assigned to surgical control (CG) and HI groups. HI animals were submitted to the Levine-Rice model at PND 3, and exposed to 120 (HI-120′), 180 (HI-180′) or 210 (HI-210′) minutes of hypoxia (FiO2: 0.08). Sensorimotor function was assessed as from PND 35–45, by means of grasping strength, adhesive removal, cylinder and ladder walking tests. Histological staining was used to quantify the striatal volume and the cross-sectional area (CSA) of skeletal muscles. Cylinder and adhesive removal test evidenced that HI-180′ and HI-210′ groups had asymmetrical use of the forepaws when compared to controls. HI animals showed a decrease in the step placement quality and an increase in step errors when compared to CG (P ⩽ 0.05). Reduction in striatal volume correlates with behavioral assessment, HI-180′ and HI-210′ groups presented lower biceps brachii and tibialis anterior CSA. These results show that rats exposed to longer hypoxic periods at PND3 have encephalic and sensorimotor impairments that mimic those observed in preterm infants. Morphological changes in muscle tissue evidence a new pathophysiological characteristic of the HI model that might be of relevance for the study of sensorimotor deficits.

This study was to investigate the role of p38 activation via ERK1/2 phosphorylation in neurons and microglia of the spinal trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc) in the promotion of orofacial hyperalgesia induced by unilateral anterior crossbite (UAC) traumatic occlusion in adult rats. U0126, a p-ERK1/2 inhibitor, was injected intracisternally before UAC implant. The effects of the U0126 injection were compared to those following the injection of SB203580, a p-p38 inhibitor. Mechanical hyperalgesia was evaluated via pressure pain threshold measurements. Brain stem tissues were processed for a Western blot analysis to evaluate the activation of ERK1/2 and p38. Double immunofluorescence was also performed to observe the expression of p-ERK1/2 and p-p38 in neurons (labeled by NeuN) and microglia (labeled by OX42). The data showed that UAC caused orofacial hyperalgia ipsilaterally on d1 to d7, peaking on d3 (P &lt; 0.05). An upregulation of p-ERK1/2 was observed in the ipsilateral Vc on d1 to d3, peaking on d1. An upregulation of p-p38 was also observed on d1 to d7, peaking on d3 (P &lt; 0.05). p-ERK1/2 primarily co-localized with NeuN and, to a lesser extent, with OX42, while p-p38 co-localized with both NeuN and OX42. Pretreatment with U0126 prevented the upregulation of both p-ERK1/2 and p-p38. Similarly to an intracisternal injection of SB203580, U0126 pretreatment attenuated the UAC-induced orofacial hyperalgesia. These data indicate that UAC caused orofacial hyperalgesia by inducing central sensitization via the activation of ERK1/2 and p38 in both neurons and microglia in the Vc, potentially impacting the effects of p-ERK1/2 during p38 activation.

AB  - Abstract
Identifying the brain sources of neural activation during processing of emotional information remains a very challenging task. In this work, we investigated the response to different emotional stimuli and the effect of age on the neuronal activation. Two negative emotion conditions, i.e., ‘anger’ and ‘fear’ faces were presented to 22 adult female participants (11 young and 11 elderly) while acquiring high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) data of 256 channels. Brain source localization was utilized to study the modulations in the early N170 event-related-potential component. The results revealed alterations in the amplitude of N170 and the localization of areas with maximum neural activation. Furthermore, age-induced differences are shown in the topographic maps and the neural activation for both emotional stimuli. Overall, aging appeared to affect the limbic area and its implication to emotional processing. These findings can serve as a step toward the understanding of the way the brain functions and evolves with age which is a significant element in the design of assistive environments.

AB  - Abstract
The M-current (IM) is a voltage-dependent, persistent K+ current so termed because it is strongly inhibited by the cholinergic agonist muscarine. The IM main function is to limit neuronal excitability by contrasting action potential firing. Although motoneurons are sensitive to acetylcholine, the role of IM in modulating their excitability is still controversial. The aim of the present report was to examine the presence of IM in hypoglossal motoneurons (HMs) and its role in the modulation of firing properties using an in vitro model of rat brainstem slice. For this purpose, we employed the whole-cell patch-clamp technique to record HM responses upon stimulation with either a standard IM deactivation voltage protocol or depolarizing current steps. Voltage commands from depolarized potential induced inward relaxations with the common characteristics of IM, comprising inhibition by either muscarine (10 μM) or the selective IM inhibitor linopirdine (30 μM). IM was pharmacologically distinguished from the hyperpolarization-activated inward-rectifying current and, within the −20 to −50 mV range, deactivated with &gt;100-ms time constant. Current-clamp experiments demonstrated that IM strongly regulated HM action potential firing, since both muscarine and linopirdine increased spike frequency whereas the M-channel opener retigabine (20 μM) reduced it. Conversely, IM seemed uninvolved in the generation of the medium afterhyperpolarizing potential. Our results suggest that HMs possess IM, whose pharmacological modulation is an important tool to up- or down-regulate excitability, to be explored in experimental models of neurodegeneration.

AB  - Abstract
In the vertebrate retina, horizontal cells (HCs) reveal homologous coupling by gap junctions (gj), which are thought to consist of different connexins (Cx). However, recent studies in mouse, rabbit and zebrafish retina indicate that individual HCs express more than one connexin. To provide further insights into the composition of gj connecting HCs and to determine whether HCs express multiple connexins, we examined the molecular identity and distribution of gj between HCs of the carp retina.

We have cloned four carp connexins designated Cx49.5, Cx55.5, Cx52.6 and Cx53.8 with a close relationship to connexins previously reported in HCs of mouse, rabbit and zebrafish, respectively. Using in situ hybridization, Cx49.5 expression was detected in different subpopulations of retinal neurons including HCs, whereas the Cx52.6 transcript was localized exclusively in HCs. Using specific antibodies, Cx55.5 and Cx53.8 were detected on dendrites of all four HC subtypes and axon terminals. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed the presence of Cx55.5 and Cx53.8 in gap junctions between these processes and Cx55.5 was additionally observed in HC dendrites invaginating cone pedicles, suggesting its participation in the modulation of photoreceptor output in the carp retina. Furthermore, using single-cell RT–PCR, all four connexins were detected in different subtypes of HCs, suggesting overlapping expression patterns. Thus, the composition of gj mediating homologous coupling between subtypes of carp HCs appears to be more complex than expected. Moreover, BLAST searches of the preliminary carp genome, using novel sequences as query, suggest that most of the analyzed connexin genes are duplicated in carp.

AB  - Abstract
Long-term l-DOPA treatment of Parkinson’s disease is accompanied with fluctuations of motor responses and l-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). Phosphorylation of the dopamine and c-AMP regulated phosphoprotein of 32 kDa (DARPP-32) plays a role in the pathogenesis of LID, and thus dephosphorylation of this protein by activated calcineurin may help reduce LID. One important activator of calcineurin is the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. Here, we investigated whether intrastriatal injection of ionomycin to hemiparkinsonian rats produced changes in l-DOPA responses including LID. We also analyzed the effects of ionomycin on key molecular mediators of LID. Results confirmed our hypothesis that ionomycin could downregulate the phosphorylation of DARPP32 at Thr-34 and reduce LID. Besides, ionomycin decreased two established molecular markers of LID, FosB/ΔFosB and phosphorylated ERK1/2. Ionomycin also decreased the phosphorylation of three main subunits of the NMDA receptor, NR1 phosphorylated at ser896, NR2A phosphorylated at Tyr-1325, and NR2B phosphorylated at Tyr-1472. Furthermore, the anti-LID effect of striatally injected ionomycin was not accompanied by reduction of the antiparkinsonian action of l-DOPA. These data indicate that ionomycin largely interacts with striatal mechanisms that are critical to the l-DOPA motor response highlighting the role of protein dephosphorylation by calcineurin.

AB  - Abstract
The present work was designed to study the mechanisms associated with Nurr1 modulation following early life permethrin (PERM) treatment during rat’s life span. Here we demonstrate that PERM exposure in rats, at a dose close to No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for 15 days during neonatal brain development leads to its accumulation long after exposure. In striatum from adolescent rats we detected an increase in DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) such as DNMT1, DNMT3a, Tyrosine hydroxylase, monomeric and aggregated α-synuclein protein levels. Adult rats showed enhanced DNMT3b and α-synuclein aggregation compared to the control group, while with aging a significant decrease in all biomarkers studied was observed. No changes in Nurr1 promoter methylation in adolescent, adult and old rats were found.

In silico studies showed clear evidence of a strong binding interaction between PERM and its metabolite 3-phenoxybenzoic acid with the nuclear orphan receptor Nurr1. These findings suggest that an additional interference with the dopaminergic neuron pathway could occur in situ during PERM accumulation in brain.

Therefore, Nurr1 modulation in early life PERM-treated rats, depends on age-related adaptive responses in animals.

AB  - Abstract
The prefrontal cortex is essential for executive functions such as decision-making and planning. There is also accumulating evidence that it is important for the modulation of pain. In this study, we investigated a possible role of prefrontal cortical calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2) in antinociception induced by the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) and tetracyclic (tricyclic) antidepressant, maprotiline. Intraperitoneal injections of maprotiline increased iPLA2 mRNA and protein expression in the prefrontal cortex. This treatment also reduced grooming responses to von-Frey hair stimulation of the face after facial carrageenan injection, indicating decreased sensitivity to pain. The antinociceptive effect of maprotiline was abrogated by iPLA2 antisense oligonucleotide injection to the prefrontal cortex, indicating a role of this enzyme in antinociception. In contrast, injection of iPLA2 antisense oligonucleotide to the somatosensory cortex did not reduce the antinociceptive effect of maprotiline. Lipidomic analysis of the prefrontal cortex showed decrease in phosphatidylcholine species, but increase in lysophosphatidylcholine species, indicating increased PLA2 activity, and release of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) after maprotiline treatment. Differences in sphingomyelin/ceramide were also detected. These changes were not observed in maprotiline-treated mice that received iPLA2 antisense oligonucleotide to the prefrontal cortex. Metabolites of DHA and EPA may help to strengthen a known supraspinal antinociceptive pathway from the prefrontal cortex to the periaqueductal gray. Together, results indicate a role of prefrontal cortical iPLA2 and its enzymatic products in the antinociceptive effect of maprotiline.

AB  - Abstract
Preparation for postural instability engages cortical resources that serve to optimize compensatory balance responses. Engagement of these cortical resources in cognitive dual-task activities may impact the ability to appropriately prepare and optimize responses to instability. The purpose of this study was to determine whether cognitive dual-task activities influenced cortical activity preceding and following postural instability. Postural instability was induced using a lean-and-release paradigm in 10 healthy participants. Perturbations were either temporally predictable (PRED) or unpredictable (UNPRED) and presented with (COG) or without a cognitive dual-task, presented in blocks of trials. The electroencephalogram was recorded from multiple frontal electrode sites. EEG data were averaged over 25–35 trials across conditions. Area under the curve of pre-perturbation cortical activity and peak latency and amplitude of post-perturbation cortical activity were quantified at the Cz site and compared across conditions. Performance of the concurrent cognitive task reduced the mean (SE) magnitude of pre-perturbation cortical activity in advance of predictable bouts of postural instability (PRED: 18.7(3.0) mV ms; PRED-COG; 14.0(2.3) mV ms). While the level of cognitive load influenced the amplitude of the post-perturbation N1 potential in the predictable conditions, there were no changes in N1 with a cognitive dual task during unpredictable conditions (PRED: −32.1(3.2) µV; PRED-COG: −50.8(8.4) µV; UNPRED: −65.0(12.2) µV; UNPRED-COG: −64.2(12.7) µV). Performance of the cognitive task delayed and reduced the magnitude of the initial gastrocnemius response. The findings indicate that pre- and post-perturbation cortical activity is affected by a cognitive distractor when postural instability is temporally predictable. Distraction also influences associated muscle responses.

AB  - Abstract
A loud acoustic stimulus (LAS) is often used as a tool to investigate motor preparation in simple reaction time (RT) tasks, where all movement parameters are known in advance. In this report, we used a LAS to examine direction specification in simple and choice RT tasks. This allowed us to investigate how the specification of movement direction unfolds during the preparation period. In two experiments, participants responded to the appearance of an imperative stimulus (IS) with a ballistic wrist force directed toward one of two targets. In probe trials, a LAS (120 dBa) was delivered around the time of IS presentation. In Experiment 1, RTs in the simple RT task were faster when the LAS was presented, but the effect on the movement kinematics was negligible. In the Choice RT task, however, movement direction variability increased when the LAS was presented. In Experiment 2, when we primed movements toward one direction, our analyses revealed that the longer participants took to start a movement, the more accurate their responses became. Our results show not only that movement direction reprogramming occurs quickly and continuously, but also that LAS can be a valuable tool to obtain meaningful readouts of the motor system’s preparatory state.

AB  - Abstract
Social bonds, especially attachment relationships, are crucial to our health and happiness. However, what we know about the neural substrates of these bonds is almost exclusively limited to rodent models and correlational experiments in humans. Here, we used socially monogamous non-human primates, titi monkeys (Callicebus cupreus) to experimentally examine changes in regional and global cerebral glucose metabolism (GCGM) during the formation and maintenance of pair bonds. Baseline positron emission tomography (PET) scans were taken of thirteen unpaired male titi monkeys. Seven males were then experimentally paired with females, scanned and compared, after one week, to six age-matched control males. Five of the six control males were then also paired and scanned after one week. Scans were repeated on all males after four months of pairing. PET scans were coregistered with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and region of interest (ROI) analysis was carried out. A primary finding was that paired males showed a significant increase in [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in whole brain following one week of pairing, which is maintained out to four months. Dopaminergic, “motivational” areas and those involved in social behavior showed the greatest change in glucose uptake. In contrast, control areas changed only marginally more than GCGM. These findings confirm the large effects of social bonds on GCGM. They also suggest that more studies should examine how social manipulations affect whole-brain FDG uptake, as opposed to assuming that it does not change across condition.

AB  - Abstract
Studies employing the Ultimatum Game (UG) which involves two parties (i.e., proposers and responders) splitting some money have suggested the role that anterior insula (AI) plays in detecting fairness norm violation, i.e., violation of the responder’s expectation of receiving equal splits from the proposer. In this study, we explored how AI would respond when there existed simultaneously another expectation of being treated equivalently as others. Participants acted as responders and would be informed about both the offers they received and the average amount of money the same proposer offered to others. Hence we introduced different conditions where participants were treated equivalently or not equivalently as other responders in UG. Participants could decide to accept or reject the offer with acceptance leading to the suggested split and rejection leaving both parties nothing. Behavioral results showed that participants rejected more unfair offers and reacted more slowly during acceptance (vs. rejection) of offers when they were offered less than others. At the neural level, stronger AI activation was observed when participants received unfair relative to fair offers, as well as when they received unequal relative to equal offers. Moreover, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dmPFC/dACC) exhibited greater activity during receiving unequal (vs. equal) offers and during acceptance (vs. rejection) of offers which were less than others’. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that the treatment of others modulated both behavioral responses to unfairness and neural correlates of the fairness-related decision-making process, and that AI played a general role in detecting norm violations.

Pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) has been considered a critically important region in the regulation of some of the physiological functions that fail during the progression of Parkinson’s disease (PD). In this paper, the effects of unilateral neurotoxic lesion of the PPN [through the injection of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) solution (concentration: 0.1 M; volume: 0.5 µL)] in motor execution and gait disorders and the changes in cellular and molecular indicators in rat nigral tissue were evaluated. The motor execution was assessed using the beam test (BT) and the gait disorders by footprint test. Glutathione (GSH) concentrations, acetyl cholinesterase enzymatic activity (AChE EA), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression in nigral tissue were analyzed. NMDA-lesioned rats showed fine motor dysfunction with a significant increase in the slow (p ≤ 0.01) and fast movement (p ≤ 0.01) time and in path deviation (p ≤ 0.01) on the smaller diameter beams. Moreover, NMDA-lesioned rats exhibited an imprecise path with moments of advances and setbacks, alternating with left and right deviations, suspensions, and inverted positions. Footprint test revealed slight gait disorders, which were manifested by a reduction in the left and right stride lengths, the intra-step distance, and the support area (p ≤ 0.01). Biochemical studies showed that 48 h after the PPN neurotoxic injury, the GSH concentrations and BDNF expression were significantly increased (p ≤ 0.01). These variables returned to normal values 7 days after the PPN lesion; the AChE EA showed a significant increase at this time. These functional changes in nigral tissue could be a plastic responses associated with early PD.

AB  - Abstract
Microglia are immune cells in the brain and play a pivotal role in the progression of ischemic injury, but the gene expression and signaling pathways related to the activation of microglia following ischemia remain unclear. In our experiment, we used digital gene expression (DGE) analysis to profile the transcriptome of ischemic tissue in a photothrombosis model. DGE analysis identified that a total of 749 genes were differentially regulated (643 up-regulated and 106 down-regulated) after 2 days and 7 days following stroke. We found 74.5% of these differentially expressed genes were microglial genes. Gene ontology (GO) analysis categorizes these differentially expressed genes at 2 days and 7 days to specific biological processes such as inflammatory response, cell activation, cell proliferation, and chemokine and cytokine production. Our data demonstrated that a large number of microglial genes were highly regulated at 2 days after stroke, but the number of differentially expressed genes had reduced drastically by 7 days. Importantly, some of the differentially expressed microglial genes at 7 days did not show differential expression at 2 days after stroke. DGE analysis indicated that specific genes related to microgliosis were regulated after ischemia. Consistent with the changes in transcriptome, the results from histological analysis of transgenic mice revealed that the microglia proliferated and aggregated surrounding the ischemic core during the period from 2 days to 7 days following photothrombosis. Together, these results suggested that transcriptomic changes in microglial genes after stroke may have a profound implication for pathophysiology and treatment of stroke.

AB  - Abstract
Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are associated with many pathophysiological processes, such as neuronal death during ischemic stroke, epileptic seizure and nociception. However, there is a dearth of ASIC-specific therapeutic blockers. Here we report that quercetin, a plant flavonoid, which is known for its neuroprotective effect, reversibly inhibits homomeric rat ASIC1a, ASIC2a and ASIC3 with an IC50 of about 2 µM. Also, quercetin prevents low pH-induced intracellular calcium rise and cell death in HEK-293 cells, which have endogenous expression of ASIC1a and 2a. The inhibitory effect of quercetin on ASICs is not due to membrane perturbation, as it did not have any effect on other channels, like NMDA receptor, GABAA receptor and P2X4 receptor. Unlike quercetin, another flavonoid resveratrol had no effect on ASIC1a. Computational analysis revealed that quercetin binds to the channel in a cavity at the central vestibule, lined by several charged residues like Q276, R369, E373 and E416 in ASIC1a. Mutation of Arg369 to Ala or Glu416 to Gln abolished the inhibitory effect of quercetin on rat ASIC1a completely, while Glu373 to Gln showed reduced sensitivity. Our results raise the possibility of using quercetin for targeting ASICs in vivo.

AB  - Abstract
Activated microglia cells (MCs) are able to release a large amount of inflammatory cytokines after ischemic stroke, which exacerbates neuron damage. In this study, we explored the functional involvement of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) SNHG14 and its potential regulatory mechanism in the activation of MCs. The mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and microglia cell model of oxygen/glucose deprivation (OGD) were made. The expression of SNHG14, miR-145-5p and PLA2G4A protein expression was determined by quantitative real time PCR and western blot, respectively. Dual-luciferase assay was used to verify the direct binding of miR-145-5p and PLA2G4A. Flow cytometry was applied to measure neurons’ apoptosis. SNHG14 highly expressed in ischemic cerebral tissues and BV-2 cells after OGD treatment. SNHG14 knockdown could remarkably inhibit BV-2 cells activation induced by OGD; while SNHG14 overexpression significantly promoted BV-2 cells activation, showing an increase of TNF-α and NO production and neurons’ apoptosis rate. Additionally, SNHG14 knockdown promoted the expression of miR-145-5p and reduced PLA2G4A. Contrarily, SNHG14 overexpression inhibited miR-145-5p expression and increased PLA2G4A. Moreover, miR-145-5p overexpression also reversed the effect of OGD on BV-2 cells activation. Bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase assay supported that SNHG14 could bind directly to miR-145-5p and miR-145-5p-binding site was existed on 3′-UTR of PLA2G4A. MiR-145-5p mimic reversed the increase of PLA2G4A and reduced the high levels of TNF-α and NO in BV-2 cells induced by SNHG14 overexpression. SNHG14 increased the expression of PLA2G4A by inhibition of miR-145-5p, which resulted in the activation of MCs in cerebral infarction.

AB  - Abstract
While the transition from the inspiratory to the post-inspiratory (post-I) phase is dependent on the pons, little attention has been paid to understanding the role of the pontine respiratory nuclei, specifically the Kölliker–Fuse nucleus (KF), in transitioning from post-I to the late expiratory (late-E) activity seen with elevated respiratory drive. To elucidate this, we used the in situ working heart-brainstem preparation of juvenile male Holtzman rats and recorded from the vagus (cVN), phrenic (PN) and abdominal nerves (AbN) during baseline conditions and during chemoreflex activation [with potassium cyanide (KCN; n = 13) or hypercapnia (8% CO2; n = 10)] to recruit active expiration. Chemoreflex activation with KCN increased PN frequency and cVN post-I and AbN activities. The inhibition of KF with isoguvacine microinjections (10 mM) attenuated the typical increase in PN frequency and cVN post-I activity, and amplified the AbN response. During hypercapnia, AbN late-E activity emerged in association with a significant reduction in expiratory time. KF inhibition during hypercapnia significantly decreased PN frequency and reduced the duration and amplitude of post-I cVN activity, while the onset of the AbN late-E bursts occurred significantly earlier. Our data reveal a negative relationship between KF-induced post-I and AbN late-E activities, suggesting that the KF coordinates the transition between post-I to late-E activity during conditions of elevated respiratory drive.

AB  - Abstract
The rodent parafascicular nucleus (PFn) or the centromedian-parafascicular complex of primates is a posterior intralaminar nucleus of the thalamus related to cortical activation and maintenance of states of consciousness underlying attention, learning and memory. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the PFn has been proved to restore arousal and consciousness in humans and to enhance performance in learning and memory tasks in rats. The primary expected effect of PFn DBS is to induce plastic changes in target neurons of brain areas associated with cognitive function. In this study, Wistar rats were stimulated for 20 mins in the PFn following a DBS protocol that had previously facilitated memory in rats. NMDA and GABAB receptor binding, and gene expression of the GluN1subunit of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) were assessed in regions related to cognitive functions, such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The results showed that PFn DBS induced a decrease in NMDAR GluN1 subunit gene expression in the cingulate and prelimbic cortices, but no significant statistical differences were found in the density of NMDA or GABAB receptors in any of the analyzed regions. Taken together, our findings suggest a possible role for the NMDAR GluN1 subunit in the prefrontal cortex in the procognitive actions of the PFn DBS.

AB  - Abstract
Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) reveal musical experience refines neural encoding and confers stronger categorical perception (CP) and neural organization for speech sounds. In addition to evoked brain activity, the human EEG can be decomposed into induced (non-phase-locked) responses whose various frequency bands reflect different mechanisms of perceptual-cognitive processing. Here, we aimed to clarify which spectral properties of these neural oscillations are most prone to music-related neuroplasticity and which are linked to behavioral benefits in the categorization of speech. We recorded electrical brain activity while musicians and nonmusicians rapidly identified speech tokens from a sound continuum. Time-frequency analysis parsed evoked and induced EEG into alpha- (∼10 Hz), beta- (∼20 Hz), and gamma- (&gt;30 Hz) frequency bands. We found that musicians’ enhanced behavioral CP was accompanied by improved evoked speech responses across the frequency spectrum, complementing previously observed enhancements in evoked potential studies (i.e., ERPs). Brain-behavior correlations implied differences in the underlying neural mechanisms supporting speech CP in each group: modulations in induced gamma power predicted the slope of musicians’ speech identification functions whereas early evoked alpha activity predicted behavior in nonmusicians. Collectively, findings indicate that musical training tunes speech processing via two complementary mechanisms: (i) strengthening the formation of auditory object representations for speech signals (gamma-band) and (ii) improving network control and/or the matching of sounds to internalized memory templates (alpha/beta-band). Both neurobiological enhancements may be deployed behaviorally and account for musicians’ benefits in the perceptual categorization of speech.

AB  - Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition with few effective treatments. Resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound, has exhibited neuroprotective effects in many neurodegenerative diseases. However, the explicit effect and mechanism of resveratrol on SCI is still unclear. Adenosine 5′ monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), the downstream protein, play key roles in metabolizing of energy, resisting of resistance, and cellular protein homeostasis. In this study, we determined the effects of resveratrol on SCI and their potential relationship with SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway, autophagy and apoptosis. To determine the effect of resveratrol on SCI recovery, a spinal cord contusion model was employed. Rats received treatment with resveratrol or DMSO immediately following contusion. We determined that Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scores were significantly higher for injured rats treated with resveratrol. Nissl and HE staining revealed that resveratrol treatment significantly reduced the loss of motor neurons and lesion size in the spinal cord of injured rats when compared to vehicle-treated animals. Spinal cord tissue was assessed by Western blot, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemical analyses 7 days after injury for changes in expression of SIRT1/AMPK signaling pathway, autophagy and apoptosis proteins. Expression of SIRT1, p-AMPK, Beclin-1, LC3-B, and Bcl-2 was elevated in resveratrol-treated animals, whereas expression of p62, Cleaved Caspase-3, Caspase-9, and Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) was inhibited. Immunofluorescence analysis of primary neurons treated with resveratrol alone or in combination with Compound C (AMPK inhibitor) or EX527 (SIRT1 inhibitor) revealed that treatment with the inhibitors blocks the increased LC3-B expression in cells and increases the portion of TUNEL-positive cells. Taken together, these results suggest that resveratrol exerts neuroprotective effects on SCI by regulating autophagy and apoptosis mediated by the SIRT1-AMPK signaling pathway.

AB  - Abstract
In Vojta physiotherapy, also known as reflex locomotion therapy, prolonged peripheral pressure stimulation induces complex generalized involuntary motor responses and modifies subsequent behavior, but its neurobiological basis remains unknown. We hypothesized that the stimulation would induce sensorimotor activation changes in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during sequential finger opposition. Thirty healthy volunteers (mean age 24.2) underwent two randomized fMRI sessions involving manual pressure stimulation applied either at the right lateral heel according to Vojta, or at the right lateral ankle (control site). Participants were scanned before and after the stimulation when performing auditory-paced sequential finger opposition with their right hand. Despite an extensive activation decrease following both stimulation paradigms, the stimulation of the heel specifically led to an increase in task-related activation in the predominantly contralateral pontomedullary reticular formation and bilateral posterior cerebellar hemisphere and vermis. Our findings suggest that sustained pressure stimulation of the foot is associated with differential short-term changes in hand motor task-related activation depending on the stimulation. This is the first evidence for brainstem modulation after peripheral pressure stimulation, suggesting that the after-effects of reflex locomotion physiotherapy involve a modulation of the pontomedullary reticular formation.

AB  - Abstract
The simple cells of the visual cortex respond over a narrow range of stimulus orientations, and this tuning is invariant to the contrast at which the stimulus is presented. The inputs to a single cell derive from a population of thalamic cells that provide a bell-shaped tuning width and offset that increases with stimulus contrast. Synaptic depression, noise and inhibition have been proposed as feedforward mechanisms to explain why these increases do not appear in simple cells. The extent to which these three mechanisms contribute to contrast-invariant orientation tuning is unknown. Consequently, the aim was to test the hypothesis that these mechanisms do not contribute equally. Unlike previous studies, all mechanisms were examined using the same network model based on Banitt et al. (2007). The results showed that thalamocortical synaptic noise was essential and sufficient to widen tuning widths at low contrasts to that of higher contrasts but could not counteract the offset at higher contrasts.

Thalamocortical synaptic depression could only be used to counteract a small fraction of the offset otherwise the relationship between contrast and response rate was disrupted. Only broadly tuned simple and complex cell inhibition could counteract the remaining offset for all stimulus contrasts but complex cell inhibition reduced the gain of the response. These results suggest unequal contributions of these feedforward mechanisms with thalamic synaptic noise widening tuning widths for low contrasts, synaptic depression counteracting a small component of the offset and synaptic inhibition completely removing the remaining offset to produce contrast-invariant orientation tuning.

AB  - Abstract
Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a neurotrophic and neuroprotective peptide. PACAP and its receptors are widely distributed in the retina. A number of reports provided evidence that PACAP is neuroprotective in retinal degenerations. The current study compared retina cell type-specific differences in young (3–4 months) and aged adults (14–16 months), of wild-type (WT) mice and knock-out (KO) mice lacking endogenous PACAP production during the course of aging. Histological, immunocytochemical and Western blot examinations were performed. The staining for standard neurochemical markers (tyrosine hydroxylase for dopaminergic cells, calbindin 28 kDa for horizontal cells, protein kinase Cα for rod bipolar cells) of young adult PACAP KO retinas showed no substantial alterations compared to young adult WT retinas, except for the specific PACAP receptor (PAC1-R) staining. We could not detect PAC1-R immunoreactivity in bipolar and horizontal cells in young adult PACAP KO animals. Some other age-related changes were observed only in the PACAP KO mice only. These alterations included horizontal and rod bipolar cell dendritic sprouting into the photoreceptor layer and decreased ganglion cell number. Also, Müller glial cells showed elevated GFAP expression compared to the aging WT retinas. Furthermore, Western blot analyses revealed significant differences between the phosphorylation state of ERK1/2 and JNK in KO mice, indicating alterations in the MAPK signaling pathway. These results support the conclusion that endogenous PACAP contributes to protection against aging of the nervous system.

We employed simultaneous field potential recordings from CA3, subiculum and entorhinal cortex in an in vitro brain slice preparation to understand the involvement of these limbic areas in the generation of the field potential oscillations that are induced by bath application of the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol. Regularly spaced oscillations that mainly presented at theta frequency range (5–12 Hz) occurred synchronously in all three structures in the presence of carbachol. These oscillations, which disappeared when slices were perfused with pirenzepine or with glutamatergic receptor antagonists, were categorized as short (&lt;4 s) and long (&gt;4 s) with short events oscillating at higher frequencies than long events. Field oscillations were highly synchronized between regions and latency analysis revealed that they often initiated in the entorhinal cortex later than in the other two structures. Blocking GABAA receptors modified the activity patterns of both short and long oscillations and decreased their coherence in the theta frequency range. Finally, blocking KCC2 activity disclosed a pattern of recurrent short oscillations. Our results suggest that in the presence of carbachol both subiculum and CA3 most often drive theta generators in the entorhinal cortex and that these oscillations are influenced but not abolished by altering GABAA receptor signaling.

AB  - Abstract
AO-PNS is a stimulation protocol combining action observation (AO) and peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) to induce plasticity in the primary motor cortex (M1) (increased excitability). Another method to increase M1 excitability is motor training. The combination of two protocols, which individually induce long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in overlapping neural circuits, results in a transitory occlusion or reverse of this phenomenon. This study aimed to understand the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying AO-PNS by testing whether AO-PNS and motor training induced LTP-like plasticity in, at least partially, overlapping neural networks. One group of participants practiced a motor training (finger opposition movements) followed by AO-PNS, whereas another group performed the two protocols in reverse order. Motor performance was evaluated by means of a sensor-engineered glove and transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to assess M1 excitability before and after each conditioning protocol. Motor training increased movement frequency, suggesting the occurrence of motor learning in both groups. When applied on first, both motor training and AO-PNS significantly increased the motor-evoked potential (MEP), but occluded the increase of cortical excitability expected after the following protocol, leading to a significant decrease of MEP amplitude. These results suggest that motor training and AO-PNS act on partially overlapping neuronal networks, which include M1, and that AO-PNS might be able to induce LTP-like plasticity in a similar way to overt movement execution. This candidates AO-PNS as methodology potentially useful when planning rehabilitative interventions on patients who cannot voluntarily move.

AB  - Abstract
Mitral and tufted cells in the main olfactory bulb (MOB) of anesthetized rats exhibit vigorous spontaneous activity, action potentials produced in the absence of odor stimuli. The central hypothesis of this paper is that tonic activity of centrifugal input to the MOB modulates the spontaneous activity of MOB neurons. The spontaneous activity of centrifugal fibers causes a baseline of steady-state neurotransmitter release, and odor stimulation produces transient changes in the resulting spontaneous activity. This study evaluated the effect of blocking centrifugal axon conduction in the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) by topically applying 2% lidocaine. Mean spontaneous activity of single bulbar neurons was recorded in each MOB layer before and after lidocaine application. While the spontaneous activity of most MOB neurons reversibly decreased after blockade of the LOT, the spontaneous activity of some neurons in the mitral, tufted and granule cell layers increased. The possible mechanisms producing such changes in spontaneous activity are discussed in terms of the tonic, steady-state release of excitatory and/or inhibitory signals from centrifugal inputs to the MOB. The data show for the first time that tonic centrifugal input to the MOB modulates the spontaneous activity of MOB interneurons and projection neurons. The present study is one of the few that focuses on steady-state spontaneous activity. The modulation of spontaneous activity demonstrated in this study implies a behaviorally relevant, state-dependent regulation of the MOB by the CNS.

AB  - Abstract
Factor VII (FVII) plays a key role in the initiation of the coagulation cascade and, in clinical situations, recombinant human activated FVII (rFVIIa) effectively prevents progressive hemorrhaging after a brain contusion. However, it remains unclear whether decreases in FVII activity directly lead to progressive hemorrhaging and, moreover, the precise mechanisms underlying this process are not yet known. The present study demonstrated that decreased FVII activity directly led to progressive hemorrhaging of the cerebral contusions. Administration of FVII prevented the progression of hemorrhaging from cerebral contusions by protecting microvessel endothelial cells in the penumbra of the contusion. The present study also showed that the ternary TF–FVIIa–FXa complex cleaved endogenous protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) on endothelial cells, activated the p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade, and inhibited p65 nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling. Furthermore, exposure to ternary TF–FVIIa–FXa protected endothelial cells from thrombin- or inflammatory cytokine-induced apoptosis. Although activation of the p44/42 MAPK signaling pathway is endothelial cell protein C receptor (EPCR)-dependent, inhibition of the p65 NF-κB signaling pathway is EPCR-independent; thus, the regulation mechanism underlying the effects of TF–FVIIa–FXa in vascular endothelial cells appears to be multiple signaling pathways. In summary, the present findings demonstrated that FVIIa prevented the progressive hemorrhaging of brain contusions by protecting microvessel endothelial cells via the formation of the ternary TF–FVIIa–FXa complex. These findings are novel and of great clinical significance because FVIIa is used to prevent the progressive hemorrhaging of brain contusions in humans.

Moreover, whereas the KCN-evoked escape is potentiated by CO2, it is suppressed by both lesions of PAG and clinically effective treatments with panicolytics. These and other data suggest that the PAG harbors a hypoxia-sensitive alarm system the activation of which could both precipitate panic and render the subject hypersensitive to CO2. Although prior c-Fos immunohistochemistry studies reported widespread activations of PAG following KCN injections, the employment of repeated injections of high doses of KCN (&gt;60 µg) in anesthetized rats compromised both the localization of KCN-responsive areas and their correlation with escape behavior. Accordingly, here we compared the brainstem activations of saline-injected controls (air/saline) with those produced by a single intravenous injection of 40-µg KCN (air/KCN), a 2-min exposure to 13% CO2 (CO2/saline), or a combined stimulus (CO2/KCN). Behavioral effects of KCN microinjections into the PAG were assessed as well. Data showed that whereas the KCN microinjections were ineffective, KCN intravenous injections elicited escape in all tested rats. Moreover, whereas the CO2 alone was ineffective, it potentiated the KCN-evoked escape. Compared to controls, the nucleus tractus solitarius was significantly activated in both CO2/saline and CO2/KCN groups. Additionally, whereas the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus was activated by all treatments, the rostrolateral and caudoventrolateral PAG were activated by air/KCN only. Data suggest that the latter structures are key components of a hypoxia-sensitive suffocation alarm which activation may trigger a panic attack.

AB  - Abstract
The death of mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) which are the sole myelinating cells of the central nervous system (CNS), leads to demyelination and functional deficits. Currently, there is lack of effective remyelination therapies for patients with demyelinating diseases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) mediate OL function. We hypothesized that miR-146a, by inactivating interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), promotes differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and thereby enhances remyelination. To test this hypothesis, a demyelination model induced by a cuprizone (CPZ) diet was employed, in which C57BL/6J mice were fed with a CPZ diet for 5 weeks. After termination of CPZ diet, the mice were randomly treated with continuous infusion of miR-146a mimics or mimic controls into the corpus callosum for 7 days. Compared to the mimic control, infusion of miR-146a mimics facilitated remyelination assessed by increased myelin basic proteins in the corpus callosum, which was associated with augmentation of newly generated mature OLs. Infusion of miR-146a mimics also substantially elevated miR-146a levels in the corpus callosum and fluorescently tagged miR-146a mimics were mainly detected in OPCs. Western blot and double immmunofluorescent staining analysis showed that the miR-146a treatment considerably reduced IRAK1 protein levels and the number of IRAK1-positive cells, respectively. Collectively, these data indicate that exogenous miR-146a enhances remyelination, possibly by promoting OPCs to differentiate into myelinated OLs via targeting IRAK1.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic intermittent exposure to ethanol (EtOH; CIE) that produces binge-like levels of intoxication has been associated with age-dependent deficits in cognitive functioning. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were exposed to CIE (5 g/kg, 25% EtOH, 13 intragastric gavages) beginning at three ages: early adolescence (postnatal day [PD] 28), mid-adolescence (PD35) and adulthood (PD72). In experiment 1, rats were behaviorally tested following CIE. Spatial memory was not affected by CIE, but adult CIE rats were impaired at acquiring a non-spatial discrimination task and subsequent reversal tasks. Rats exposed to CIE during early or mid-adolescence were impaired on the first reversal, demonstrating transient impairment in behavioral flexibility. Blood EtOH concentrations negatively correlated with performance on reversal tasks. Experiment 2 examined changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels within the frontal cortex (FC) and hippocampus (HPC) at four time points: during intoxication, 24 h after the final EtOH exposure (acute abstinence), 3 weeks following abstinence (recovery) and after behavioral testing. HPC BDNF levels were not affected by CIE at any time point. During intoxication, BDNF was suppressed in the FC, regardless of the age of exposure. However, during acute abstinence, reduced FC BDNF levels persisted in early adolescent CIE rats, whereas adult CIE rats displayed an increase in BDNF levels. Following recovery, neurotrophin levels in all CIE rats recovered. Our results indicate that intermittent binge-like EtOH exposure leads to acute disruptions in FC BDNF levels and long-lasting behavioral deficits. However, the type of cognitive impairment and its duration differ depending on the age of exposure.

AB  - Abstract
Mild-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is frequently associated with prolonged dysfunction of reward circuitry, including motivation and salience, which suggests alterations of dopamine (DA) processing within the core and shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAC). Using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in a rodent model of traumatic brain injury, we found that stimulus-evoked DA release is distinct in the core and shell of the NAC, with the shell being less responsive to tonic stimulation and more sensitive to the number of pulses when phasic stimulation is applied. Exposure to TBI was associated with major changes in both release and reuptake of DA in both the core and shell of NAC, with greater changes seen in the core. These alterations evolved over time, becoming most severe 1–2 weeks after injury with subsequent recovery, and the extent and progression of these abnormalities was correlated with severity of injury. Taken together, these data support behavior and anatomical studies suggesting the NAC core and striatum may subserve parallel functions, whereas the shell is distinct. These data offer a unique window on how different neurological systems respond to TBI and may help explain affective and cognitive changes that are seen.

AB  - Abstract
Early experience and social context interact to alter the phenotype of complex social behaviors. These early experiences can also result in alterations to cortical organization and connections. Given the ability of the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) to modulate social and reproductive behavior, OT is likely involved in these cortical processes. However, little is known about the distribution of OT and OT receptors (OTR) within the neocortex. Using autoradiographic and neuroanatomical techniques, we characterized the cortical distribution of OT receptors (OTR) in prairie voles, a socially monogamous rodent species. We found that OTR density was low in the primary sensory areas (including primary somatosensory and auditory regions) but was quite high in association regions (including temporal and parietal association areas, and prelimbic regions). In the primary motor area as well as the temporal and parietal association areas, we observed differences in OTR density across cortical layers. Specifically, cortical layers 2/3 and 5 exhibited greater OTR density than layer 4. Our results point to a role for OT in integrating sensory and motor in the prairie vole brain, providing a complementary mechanism for the modulation of social interactions. Given the ability of early social experience and developmental manipulations of OT to affect the brain and behavior, these results suggest a novel mechanism for how OT may influence cortical organization.

AB  - Abstract
Some studies have demonstrated that aging is associated with impaired vestibular reflexes, especially otolithic reflexes, resulting in postural instability. However, the neurochemical basis of these age-related changes is still poorly understood. The l-arginine metabolic system has been implicated in changes in the brain associated with aging. In the current study, we examined the levels of l-arginine and its metabolizing enzymes and downstream metabolites in the vestibular nucleus complex (VNC) and cerebellum (CE) of rats with and without behavioral testing which were young (4 months old), middle-aged (12 months old) or aged (24 months old). We found that aging was associated with lower nitric oxide synthase activity in the CE of animals with testing and increased arginase in the VNC and CE of animals with testing. l-citrulline and l-ornithine were lower in the VNC of aged animals irrespective of testing, while l-arginine and l-citrulline were lower in the CE with and without testing, respectively. In the VNC and CE, aging was associated with lower levels of glutamate in the VNC, irrespective of testing. In the VNC it was associated with higher levels of agmatine and putrescine, irrespective of testing. In the CE, aging was associated with higher levels of putrescine in animals without testing and with higher levels of spermine in animals with testing, and spermidine, irrespective of testing. Multivariate analyses indicated significant predictive relationships between the different variables, and there were correlations between some of the neurochemical variables and behavioral measurements. Cluster analyses revealed that aging altered the relationships between l-arginine and its metabolites. The results of this study demonstrate that there are major changes occurring in l-arginine metabolism in the VNC and CE as a result of age, as well as behavioral activity.

AB  - Abstract
Orexins are hypothalamic neuropeptides that have a documented role in mediating the acute stress response. However, their role in habituation to repeated stress, and the role of orexin receptors (OX1R and OX2R) in the stress response, has yet to be defined. Orexin neuronal activation and levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were found to be stimulated with acute restraint, but were significantly reduced by day five of repeated restraint. As certain disease states such as panic disorder are associated with increased central orexin levels and failure to habituate to repeated stress, the effect of activating orexin signaling via Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) on the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) response was evaluated after repeated restraint. While vehicle-treated rats displayed habituation of Adrenocorticotropic Hormone (ACTH) from day 1 to day 5 of restraint, stimulating orexins did not further increase ACTH beyond vehicle levels for either acute or repeated restraint. We delineated the roles of orexin receptors in acute and repeated stress using a selective OX2R antagonist (MK-1064). Pretreatment with MK-1064 reduced day 1 ACTH levels, but did not allow further habituation on day 5 compared with vehicle-treated rats, indicating that endogenous OX2R activity plays a role in acute stress, but not in habituation to repeated stress. However, in restrained rats with further stimulated orexins by DREADDs, MK-1064 decreased ACTH levels on day 5. Collectively, these results indicate that the OX2R plays a role in acute stress, and can prevent habituation to repeated stress under conditions of high orexin release.

AB  - Abstract
Although ischemic stroke is a major cause of death worldwide and the predominant cause of acquired disability, the only effective drug therapy that has been developed thus far is reperfusion by tissue plasminogen activator. Since most patients do not qualify for this treatment, new methods have to be developed. It is well known that estradiol (E2) exerts neuroprotective effects in different models of cerebral ischemia, but post-stroke treatment after an acute stroke has hardly been investigated. As many patients with an acute ischemic stroke have arterial hypertension, it is also of interest to evaluate the influence of this co-morbidity on the treatment efficacy of E2. The effects of E2 administered 30 min after a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) induced by an intracerebral injection of endothelin-1 were assessed in male normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Treatment with E2 reduced infarct size in both WKY and SHRs and decreased the number of degenerating neurons, indicating that acute treatment with E2 is indeed neuroprotective. To address the role of glia in neuroprotection, the effects of E2 on the activation of microglia and astrocytes was determined. It appeared that E2 had no effect on microglial activation, but reduced the activation of astrocytes in SHRs but not in the normotensive controls. We conclude that post-stroke E2 treatment in both normotensive and hypertensive rats is neuroprotective. Although the presence of hypertension changed the astrocytic response to E2, it did not affect treatment efficacy.

AB  - Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the progressive neurodegenerative diseases of whose condition is characterized by dopaminergic neuronal cell loss and dysfunction in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and the striatum. Recent studies have demonstrated that the nuclear receptor-related 1 protein (Nurr1) is critical of dopaminergic phenotype induction in mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. Further, Nurr1 engages in synthesizing and storing dopamine through regulating levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine transporter (DAT) and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of a herbal extract combination, consisting of Bupleurum falcatum, Paeonia suffruticosa, and Angelica dahurica (MABH), on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD-like symptoms and to elucidate possible mechanisms of action focusing on Nurr1. In a subacute mouse model of MPTP-induced PD, MABH treatment resulted in recovery from movement impairments. MABH prevented dopamine depletion and protected against dopaminergic neuronal degradation induced by MPTP. Additionally, MABH increased Nurr1 expression in the SNpc of mice. To evaluate the effects of MABH on Nurr1 expression, we measured the protein levels of Nurr1 and its regulating factors using Western blot analysis in PC12 cells. MABH treatment induced the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase protein via increasing the protein expression levels of Nurr1 and ultimately the levels of TH, VMAT2, and DAT. These results indicate that MABH has protective effects on dopaminergic neurons in a mouse model of PD by regulating Nurr1.

To date, five AP-2 genes that encode AP-2α, β, γ, δ and ε have been identified in vertebrates and they have been reported to be key regulators of embryonic development. However, the role of AP-2 family members in the development of central nervous system (CNS) has not been characterized. In the present study, we systematically examined the spatiotemporal expression pattern of AP-2 genes in the developing spinal cord of mouse and chick embryos and found that AP-2α and AP-2β are specifically expressed in post-mitotic dorsal interneurons. Loss-of-function analysis using in ovo electroporation in embryonic chick spinal cord preliminarily demonstrated that cAP-2α and cAP-2β regulates dorsal Class A and Class B interneuron specification, respectively. Gain-of-function experiments further revealed that misexpression of cAP-2α, but not cAP-2β, was able to induce the ectopic generation of Class A interneurons. Together, our studies indicated that AP-2 family members, AP-2α and AP-2β, have distinct functions in the regulation of dorsal interneuron development.

AB  - Abstract
A single exposure to amphetamine induces neurochemical sensitization in striatal areas. The neuropeptide angiotensin II, through AT1 receptors (AT1-R) activation, is involved in these responses. However, amphetamine-induced alterations can be extended to extra-striatal areas involved in blood pressure control and their physiological outcomes. Our aim for the present study was to analyze the possible role for AT1-R in these events using a two-injection protocol and to further characterize the proposed AT1-R antagonism protocol.

Central effect of orally administered AT1-R blocker (Candesartan, 3 mg/kg p.o. × 5 days) in male Wistar rats was analyzed by spontaneous activity of neurons within locus coeruleus. In another group of animals pretreated with the AT1-R blocker or vehicle, sensitization was achieved by a single administration of amphetamine (5 mg/kg i.p. – day 6) followed by a 3-week period off drug. On day 27, after receiving an amphetamine challenge (0.5 mg/kg i.p.), we evaluated: (1) the sensitized c-Fos expression in locus coeruleus (LC), nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), caudal ventrolateral medulla (A1) and central amygdala (CeAmy); and (2) the blood pressure response. AT1-R blockade decreased LC neurons’ spontaneous firing rate. Moreover, sensitized c-Fos immunoreactivity in TH + neurons was found in LC and NTS; and both responses were blunted by the AT1-R blocker pretreatment. Meanwhile, no differences were found neither in CeAmy nor A1. Sensitized blood pressure response was observed as sustained changes in mean arterial pressure and was effectively prevented by AT1-R blockade.

Our results extend AT1-R role in amphetamine-induced sensitization over noradrenergic nuclei and their cardiovascular output.

AB  - Abstract
The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) has been implicated in behavioral responses to reward-associated cues. However, the precise role of the PVT in these behaviors has been difficult to ascertain since Pavlovian-conditioned cues can act as both predictive and incentive stimuli. The “sign-tracker/goal-tracker” rat model has allowed us to further elucidate the role of the PVT in cue-motivated behaviors, identifying this structure as a critical component of the neural circuitry underlying individual variation in the propensity to attribute incentive salience to reward cues. The current study assessed differences in the engagement of specific PVT afferents and efferents in response to presentation of a food-cue that had been attributed with only predictive value or with both predictive and incentive value. The retrograde tracer fluorogold (FG) was injected into the PVT or the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of rats, and cue-induced c-Fos in FG-labeled cells was quantified. Presentation of a predictive stimulus that had been attributed with incentive value elicited c-Fos in PVT afferents from the lateral hypothalamus, medial amygdala (MeA), and the prelimbic cortex (PrL), as well as posterior PVT efferents to the NAc. PVT afferents from the PrL also showed elevated c-Fos levels following presentation of a predictive stimulus alone. Thus, presentation of an incentive stimulus results in engagement of subcortical brain regions; supporting a role for the hypothalamic–thalamic–striatal axis, as well as the MeA, in mediating responses to incentive stimuli; whereas activity in the PrL to PVT pathway appears to play a role in processing the predictive qualities of reward-paired stimuli.

AB  - Abstract
Gambling Disorder (GD) is characterized by excessive gambling despite adverse consequences on individual functioning. In spite of some positive findings, it is difficult to draw any conclusion on the genetics of GD. Indeed, beyond DNA sequence variation, other regulatory mechanisms (like those that engage epigenetics) may explain gene alterations in this addictive disease. Wistar male rats underwent an operant task for the evaluation of individual propensity to gamble. Few rats, after having learnt to prefer nose-poking for a large over a small food reward, were sacrificed to obtain a baseline profile of gene expression at both central and peripheral levels. In the remaining rats, probability of occurrence of large-reward delivery decreased progressively to very low levels. Thus, rats were faced with temptation to “gamble”, i.e. to nose-poke for a binge reward, whose delivery was omitted the majority of times. After 3 weeks of testing, rats showing a clear-cut profile of either gambling proneness or aversion were selected and sacrificed after the last session. A selective down-regulation of i) serotonin transporter in prefrontal cortex, ii) tyrosine hydroxylase in ventral striatum, iii) dopamine transporter in lymphocytes was evidenced in “gambler” vs “non-gambler” rats. The exposure to such operant task (compared to home-cage alone) modulated ventrostriatal but not prefrontal genes. A consistent increase of DNA methylation, in one specific CpG site at serotonin transporter gene, was evident in prefrontal cortex of “gambler” rats. Elucidation of epigenetic changes occurring during GD progression may pave the way to the development of new therapeutic strategies through specific modulation of epigenetic factors.

AB  - Abstract
Extraversion–introversion is a personality dimension referring to individual differences in social behavior. In the past, neurobiological research on extraversion was almost entirely based upon questionnaires which inform about the explicit self-concept. Today, indirect measures are available that tap into the implicit self-concept of extraversion which is assumed to result from automatic processing functions. In our study, brain activation while viewing facial expression of affiliation relevant (i.e., happiness, and disgust) and irrelevant (i.e., fear) emotions was examined as a function of the implicit and explicit self-concept of extraversion and processing mode (automatic vs. controlled). 40 healthy volunteers watched blocks of masked and unmasked emotional faces while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. The Implicit Association Test and the NEO Five-Factor Inventory were applied as implicit and explicit measures of extraversion which were uncorrelated in our sample. Implicit extraversion was found to be positively associated with neural response to masked happy faces in the thalamus and temporo-parietal regions and to masked disgust faces in cerebellar areas. Moreover, it was positively correlated with brain response to unmasked disgust faces in the amygdala and cortical areas. Explicit extraversion was not related to brain response to facial emotions when controlling trait anxiety. The implicit compared to the explicit self-concept of extraversion seems to be more strongly associated with brain activation not only during automatic but also during controlled processing of affiliation relevant facial emotions. Enhanced neural response to facial disgust could reflect high sensitivity to signals of interpersonal rejection in extraverts (i.e., individuals with affiliative tendencies).

AB  - Abstract
Abnormal buildup of the microtubule associated protein tau is a major pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and various tauopathies. The mechanisms by which pathological tau accumulates and spreads throughout the brain remain largely unknown. Previously, we demonstrated that a restoration of the major astrocytic glutamate transporter, GLT1, ameliorated a buildup of tau pathology and rescued cognition in a mouse model of AD. We hypothesized that aberrant extracellular glutamate and abnormal neuronal excitatory activities promoted tau pathology. In the present study, we investigated genetic interactions between tau and the GLT1 homolog dEaat1 in Drosophila melanogaster. Neuronal-specific overexpression of human wildtype tau markedly shortened lifespan and impaired motor behavior. RNAi depletion of dEaat1 in astrocytes worsened these phenotypes, whereas overexpression of dEaat1 improved them. However, the synaptic neuropil appeared unaffected, and we failed to detect any major neuronal loss with tau overexpression in combination with dEaat1 depletion. To mimic glutamate-induced aberrant excitatory input in neurons, repeated depolarization of neurons via transgenic TrpA1 was applied to the adult Drosophila optic nerves, and we examined the change of tau deposits. Repeated depolarization significantly increased the accumulation of tau in these neurons. We propose that increased neuronal excitatory activity exacerbates tau-mediated neuronal toxicity and behavioral deficits.

AB  - Abstract
Proprioception is somatic sensation that allows us to sense and recognize position, posture, and their changes in our body parts. It pertains directly to oneself and may contribute to bodily awareness. Likewise, one’s face is a symbol of oneself, so that visual self-face recognition directly contributes to the awareness of self as distinct from others. Recently, we showed that right-hemispheric dominant activity in the inferior fronto-parietal cortices, which are connected by the inferior branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF III), is associated with proprioceptive illusion (awareness), in concert with sensorimotor activity. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that visual self-face recognition shares brain regions active during proprioceptive illusion in the right inferior fronto-parietal SLF III network. We scanned brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging while twenty-two right-handed healthy adults performed two tasks. One was a proprioceptive illusion task, where blindfolded participants experienced a proprioceptive illusion of right hand movement. The other was a visual self-face recognition task, where the participants judged whether an observed face was their own. We examined whether the self-face recognition and the proprioceptive illusion commonly activated the inferior fronto-parietal cortices connected by the SLF III in a right-hemispheric dominant manner. Despite the difference in sensory modality and in the body parts involved in the two tasks, both tasks activated the right inferior fronto-parietal cortices, which are likely connected by the SLF III, in a right-side dominant manner. Here we discuss possible roles for right inferior fronto-parietal activity in bodily awareness and self-awareness.

AB  - Abstract
The immune/inflammatory signaling molecule tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is an important mediator of both constitutive and plastic signaling in the brain. In particular, TNFα is implicated in physiological processes, including fever, energy balance, and autonomic function, known to involve the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Many critical actions of TNFα are transduced by the TNFα type 1 receptor (TNFR1), whose activation has been shown to potently modulate classical neural signaling. There is, however, little known about the cellular sites of action for TNFR1 in the PVN. In the present study, high-resolution electron microscopic immunocytochemistry was used to demonstrate the ultrastructural distribution of TNFR1 in the PVN. Labeling for TNFR1 was found in somata and dendrites, and to a lesser extent in axon terminals and glia in the PVN. In dendritic profiles, TNFR1 was mainly present in the cytoplasm, and in association with presumably functional sites on the plasma membrane. Dendritic profiles expressing TNFR1 were contacted by axon terminals, which formed non-synaptic appositions, as well as excitatory-type and inhibitory-type synaptic specializations. A smaller population of TNFR1-labeled axon terminals making non-synaptic appositions, and to a lesser extent synaptic contacts, with unlabeled dendrites was also identified. These findings indicate that TNFR1 is structurally positioned to modulate postsynaptic signaling in the PVN, suggesting a mechanism whereby TNFR1 activation contributes to cardiovascular and other autonomic functions.

AB  - Abstract
Ketamine is commonly used for anesthesia in pediatric patients. Recent studies indicated that ketamine exposure in the developing brain can induce neuroapoptosis and disturb normal neurogenesis, which will result in long-lasting cognitive impairment. Minocycline exerts neuroprotection against a wide range of toxic insults in neurodegenerative disease models. In the present study, we investigated whether the disturbed neurogenesis and behavioral deficits after ketamine neonatal exposure could be alleviated by minocycline. Postnatal day (PND)7 Sprague–Dawley rat pups randomly received either normal saline, ketamine, or minocycline 30 min prior to ketamine administration, respectively. The rats were decapitated at PND14 for the detection of neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus by immunostaining. The protein expression of p-Akt, p-GSK-3β in the SVZ and SGZ at 12 h after anesthesia, PND10 and PND14 were assessed by western blotting analysis. At PND 42-47, spatial learning and memory abilities were measured by the Morris water maze in all groups. Our data showed that ketamine exposure in neonatal rats resulted in neurogenetic damage and persistent cognitive deficits, and that pretreatment with minocycline eliminated the brain development damage and improved the behavioral function in adult rats. Moreover, the protection of minocycline is associated with the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

AB  - Abstract
Phonological facilitation (PF) refers to a reduction of naming latencies when a phonologically related word is presented concurrently with the target picture, as compared to the presentation of phonologically unrelated words. According to spread of activation models of word production, this effect arises after lexical selection, during phonetic encoding, and is due to the co-activation of the phonemes shared by the target word and the distracter. Conversely, semantic interference (SI) is characterized by longer naming latencies when semantically related distracters are concurrently presented with the target picture. This effect seems to arise before lexical selection. However, alternative hypotheses postulate that PF and SI both arise at a post lexical level. In this study, we aim to shed light on this debate by investigating the neural correlates of the PF and by comparing these results with those of previous studies on SI. In two experiments, we applied anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left superior temporal gyrus (LSTG) and left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) before a picture-word interference task in which auditory distracters, which could be phonologically related or unrelated, were presented at a SOA of 150 ms or 300 ms. While stimulating the LSTG significantly reduced the PF by decreasing RTs in phonologically unrelated trials, anodal tDCS over the LIFG did not affect PF. In line with previous results, our findings support the “activation by competition” model, pointing to inhibition between target and distracters nodes as the mechanism involved in the occurrence of PF and SI.

AB  - Abstract
The mechanism of action of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) is well characterized, but some published evidence suggests the potential for neuronal retrograde transport and cell-to-cell transfer (transcytosis) under certain experimental conditions. The present study evaluated the potential for these processes using a highly selective antibody for the BoNT/A-cleaved substrate (SNAP25197) combined with 3-dimensional imaging. SNAP25197 was characterized in a rat motor neuron (MN) pathway following toxin intramuscular injections at various doses to determine whether SNAP25197 is confined to MNs or also found in neighboring cells or nerve fibers within spinal cord (SC). Results demonstrated that SNAP25197 immuno-reactive staining was colocalized with biomarkers for MNs, but not with markers for neighboring neurons, nerve fibers or glial cells. Additionally, a high dose of BoNT/A, but not a lower dose, resulted in sporadic SNAP25197 signal in distal muscles and associated SC regions without evidence for transcytosis, suggesting that the staining was due to systemic spread of the toxin. Despite this spread, functional effects were not detected in the distal muscles. Therefore, under the present experimental conditions, our results suggest that BoNT/A is confined to MNs and any evidence of distal activity is due to limited systemic spread of the toxin at higher doses and not through transcytosis within SC. Lastly, at higher doses of BoNT/A, SNAP25197 was expressed throughout MNs and colocalized with synaptic markers on the plasma membrane at 6 days post-treatment. These data support previous studies suggesting that SNAP25197 may be incorporated into SNARE-protein complexes within the affected MNs.

AB  - Abstract
Fyn is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that belongs to Src family kinases. Fyn plays a critical role in neuronal migration, but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we reported that suppression of Fyn expression in mouse cerebral cortex led to migration defects of both early-born and late-born neurons. Morphological analysis showed that loss of Fyn function impaired multipolar–bipolar transition of newly generated neurons and neurite formation in the early phase of migration. Moreover, Fyn inhibition increased the length of leading process and decreased the branching number of the migrating cortical neurons. Together, these results indicate that Fyn controls neuronal migration by regulating the cytoskeletal dynamics and multipolar–bipolar transition of newly generated neurons during cortical development.

AB  - Abstract
The basal forebrain (BF) controls sleep–wake cycles, attention and reward processing. Compared to cholinergic and GABAergic neurons, BF glutamatergic neurons are less well understood, due to difficulties in identification. Here, we use vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGluT2)-tdTomato mice, expressing a red fluorescent protein (tdTomato) in the major group of BF glutamatergic neurons (vGluT2+) to characterize their intrinsic electrical properties and cholinergic modulation. Whole-cell, patch-clamp recordings were made from vGluT2+ neurons in coronal BF slices. Most BF vGluT2+ neurons were small/medium sized (&lt;20 µm), exhibited moderately sized H-currents and had a maximal firing frequency of ∼50 Hz. However, vGluT2+ neurons in dorsal BF (ventral pallidum) had larger H-currents and a higher maximal firing rate (83 Hz). A subset of BF vGluT2+ neurons exhibited burst/cluster firing. Most vGluT2+ neurons had low-threshold calcium spikes/currents. vGluT2+ neurons located in ventromedial regions of BF (in or adjacent to the horizontal limb of the diagonal band) were strongly hyperpolarized by the cholinergic agonist, carbachol, a finding apparently in conflict with their increased discharge during wakefulness/REM sleep and hypothesized role in wake-promotion. In contrast, most vGluT2+ neurons located in lateral BF (magnocellular preoptic area) or dorsal BF did not respond to carbachol. Our results suggest that BF glutamatergic neurons are heterogeneous and have morphological, electrical and pharmacological properties which distinguish them from BF cholinergic and GABAergic neurons. A subset of vGluT2+ neurons, possibly those neurons which project to reward-related areas such as the habenula, are hyperpolarized by cholinergic inputs, which may cause phasic inhibition during reward-related events.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic pain is associated with autonomic disturbance. However, specific effects of chronic back pain on sympathetic regulation remain unknown. Chronic pain is also associated with structural changes in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which may be linked to sympathetic dysregulation. The aim of this study was to determine whether sympathetic regulation and ACC surface and volume are affected in a rat model of chronic back pain, in which complete Freund Adjuvant (CFA) is injected in back muscles. Sympathetic regulation was assessed with renal blood flow (RBF) changes induced by electrical stimulation of a hind paw, while ACC structure was examined by measuring cortical surface and volume. RBF changes and ACC volume were compared between control rats and rats injected with CFA in back muscles segmental (T10) to renal sympathetic innervation or not (T2). In rats with CFA, chronic inflammation was observed in the affected muscles in addition to increased nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) protein expression in corresponding spinal cord segments (p = 0.01) as well as decreased ACC volume (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, intensity-dependent decreases in RBF during hind paw stimulation were attenuated by chronic pain at T2 (p’s &lt; 0.05) and T10 (p’s &lt; 0.05), but less so at T10 compared with T2 (p’s &lt; 0.05). These results indicate that chronic back pain alters sympathetic functions through non-segmental mechanisms, possibly by altering descending regulatory pathways from ACC. Yet, segmental somato-sympathetic reflexes may compete with non-segmental processes depending on the back region affected by pain and according to the segmental organization of the sympathetic nervous system.

AB  - Abstract
Extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) has several health promoting effects. Evidence have shown that EVOO attenuates the pathology of amyloid-β (Aβ) and improves cognitive function in experimental animal models, suggesting it’s potential to protect and reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Available studies have linked this beneficial effect to oleocanthal, one of the active components in EVOO. The effect of oleocanthal against AD pathology has been linked to its ability to attenuate Aβ and tau aggregation in vitro, and enhance Aβ clearance from the brains of wild-type and AD transgenic mice in vivo. However, the ability of oleocanthal to alter the toxic effect of Aβ on brain parenchymal cells is unknown. In the current study, we investigated oleocanthal effect on modulating Aβ oligomers (Aβo) pathological events in neurons and astrocytes. Our findings demonstrated oleocanthal prevented Aβo-induced synaptic proteins, SNAP-25 and PSD-95, down-regulation in neurons, and attenuated Aβo-induced inflammation, glutamine transporter (GLT1) and glucose transporter (GLUT1) down-regulation in astrocytes. Aβo-induced inflammation was characterized by interleukin-6 (IL-6) increase and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) upregulation that were reduced by oleocanthal. In conclusion, this study provides further evidence to support the protective effect of EVOO-derived phenolic secoiridoid oleocanthal against AD pathology.

AB  - Abstract
Few minutes of focal vibration (FV) on limb muscles can improve motor control in neurological (stroke, Parkinson) patients for unknown underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. Here we hypothesized that in healthy volunteers this FV would increase excitability in the primary sensorimotor cortex (S1-M1) during an isometric contraction of the stimulated muscle. The design included an initial control condition with no FV stimulation (Baseline) as well as three short experimental sessions of FV and a Sham (fake) session in a pseudo-random order. In the Baseline condition and immediately after those sessions, electroencephalographic (EEG) activity was recorded during a mild isometric muscle contraction of the right arm. Alpha and beta motor-related EEG power desynchronization (MRPD) at C4 and C3 electrodes overlying Rolandic regions were used as an index of the cortical excitation in S1-M1. Results showed that, compared to the Baseline (no FV) or Sham stimulation, the first two FV sessions showed a cumulative increase in alpha (but not beta) MRPD at C3 electrode, suggesting a specific effect of vibration on the excitability of contralateral S1-M1 generating EEG “mu” rhythms. FV over limb muscles modulates neurophysiological oscillations enhancing excitability of contralateral S1-M1 in healthy volunteers. The proposed mechanism may explain the clinical effects of vibratory rehabilitation in neurological patients with motor deficits.

AB  - Abstract
Ocular dominance has been extensively studied, often with the goal to understand neuroplasticity, which is a key characteristic within the critical period. Recent work on monocular deprivation, however, demonstrates residual neuroplasticity in the adult visual cortex. After deprivation of patterned inputs by monocular patching, the patched eye becomes more dominant. Since patching blocks both the Fourier amplitude and phase information of the input image, it remains unclear whether deprivation of the Fourier phase information alone is able to reshape eye dominance. Here, for the first time, we show that removing of the phase regularity without changing the amplitude spectra of the input image induced a shift of eye dominance toward the deprived eye, but only if the eye dominance was measured with a binocular rivalry task rather than an interocular phase combination task. These different results indicate that the two measurements are supported by different mechanisms. Phase integration requires the fusion of monocular images. The fused percept highly relies on the weights of the phase-sensitive monocular neurons that respond to the two monocular images. However, binocular rivalry reflects the result of direct interocular competition that strongly weights the contour information transmitted along each monocular pathway. Monocular phase deprivation may not change the weights in the integration (fusion) mechanism much, but alters the balance in the rivalry (competition) mechanism. Our work suggests that ocular dominance plasticity may occur at different stages of visual processing, and that homeostatic compensation also occurs for the lack of phase regularity in natural scenes.

AB  - Abstract
Exposure to chronic stress following stroke has been shown, both clinically and pre-clinically, to impact negatively on the recovery process. While this phenomenon is well established, the specific mechanisms involved have remained largely unexplored. One obvious signaling pathway through which chronic stress may impact on the recovery process is via corticosterone, and its effects on microglial activity and vascular remodeling. In the current study, we were interested in examining how orally delivered corticosterone at a stress-like concentration impacted on microglial activity and vascular remodeling after stroke. We identified that corticosterone administration for two weeks following stroke significantly increased tissue loss and decreased the weight of the spleen and thymus. We also identified that corticosterone administration significantly altered the expression of the key microglial complement receptor, CD11b after stroke. Corticosterone administration did not alter the expression of the vessel basement membrane protein, Collagen IV after stroke. Together, these results suggest that corticosterone is likely to represent only one of the major stress signals responsible for driving the negative impacts of chronic stress on recovery.

AB  - Abstract
The visual system classifies objects into categories, and distinct populations of neurons within the temporal lobe respond preferentially to objects of a given perceptual category. We can also classify the objects we recognize with the sense of touch, but less is known about the neuronal correlates underlying this cognitive function. To address this question, we performed a multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI) activity to identify the cortical areas that can be used to decode the category of objects explored with the hand. We observed that tactile object category can be decoded from the activity patterns of somatosensory and parietal areas. Importantly, we found that categories can also be decoded from the lateral occipital complex (LOC), which is a multimodal region known to be related to the representation of object shape. Furthermore, a hyperalignment analysis showed that activity patterns are similar across subjects. Our results thus indicate that tactile object recognition generates category-specific patterns of activity in a multisensory area known to encode objects, and that these patterns have a similar functional organization across individuals.

The Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway is recapitulated in response to ischemic injury. Here, we investigated the clinical implications of Shh protein in the ischemic stroke and explored the underlying mechanism. Intracerebroventricular injection of Shh, Cyclopamine, or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was performed immediately after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) surgery and lasted for 7 days (d). Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used as control. Neurological deficits and infarct volume were examined 7 d after pMCAO. Microvascular density with fluorescein-iso-thiocyanate (FITC) assay and double staining with CD31 and Ki-67 was measured at 7 d. To observe in vitro angiogenesis, rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (RBMECs) were incubated under oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) for 6 h (h) and treated with Shh/anti-VEGF. We found that (1) Shh improved neurological scores and reduced infarct volume, which was blocked by Cyclopamine, (2) Shh improved the microvascular density and promoted angiogenesis and neuron survival in the ischemic boundary zone, (3) Shh enhanced VEGF expression and VEGF antibody could reverse angiogenic and protective effect of Shh in vivo and in vitro. These data demonstrate that the administration of Shh protein could protect brain from ischemic injury, in part by promoting angiogenic repair.

AB  - Abstract
The μ-opioid receptor (MOR) and dopamine D1 receptor are co-expressed in the medium spiny neurons of striatal areas and the signaling pathways activated by these two receptors are in functional competition. However, in certain conditions an integrated response mediated by the dopamine D1 receptor transduction system is observed. In mice, morphine administration induces hypermotility and this response has been described in terms of a β-arrestin2-dependent mechanism that favors prevalent dopamine D1 receptor activation. In rats, acute morphine administration induces hypermotility only when the animals are food-deprived (FD). We aimed to further investigate the functional interaction between the MOR and dopamine D1 receptors in striatal areas and we studied the effects of acute pharmacological MOR stimulation on motility and nucleus accumbens shell (NAcS) dopamine D1 receptor signaling in control rats and rats with reduced β-arrestin2 expression in the NAcS, either non food-deprived (NFD) or FD. Motility and dopamine D1 receptor signaling increased only in FD rats in a β-arrestin2-dependent way. Moreover, FD rats showed a β-arrestin2-dependent increase in the levels of MOR-dopamine D1 receptor heteromeric complexes in the NAcS. Sucrose consumption is accompanied by release of endogenous opioids and dopamine in the NAcS. We then examined MOR-dopamine D1 receptor interactions after sucrose consumption. Sucrose increased NAcS dopamine D1 receptor signaling in NFD and FD rats, and a reduction in β-arrestin2 expression prevented this effect selectively in FD rats. These results show the β-arrestin2-dependent prevalence of dopamine D1 receptor signaling in response to acute morphine or sucrose consumption elicited by food deprivation in rats.

AB  - Abstract
Since Ebbinghaus’ classical work on oblivion and saving effects, we know that declarative memories may become at first spontaneously irretrievable and only subsequently completely extinguished. Recently, this time-dependent path toward memory-trace loss has been shown to correlate with different patterns of brain activation. Environmental enrichment (EE) enhances learning and memory and affects system memory consolidation. However, there is no evidence on whether and how EE could affect the time-dependent path toward oblivion.

We used Object Recognition Test (ORT) to assess in adult mice put in EE for 40 days (EE mice) or left in standard condition (SC mice) memory retrieval of the familiar objects 9 and 21 days after learning with or without a brief retraining performed the day before. We found that SC mice show preferential exploration of new object at day 9 only with retraining, while EE mice do it even without. At day 21 SC mice do not show preferential exploration of novel object, irrespective of the retraining, while EE mice are still capable to benefit from retraining, even if they were not able to spontaneously recover the trace. Analysis of c-fos expression 20 days after learning shows a different pattern of active brain areas in response to the retraining session in EE and SC mice, with SC mice recruiting the same brain network as naïve SC or EE mice following de novo learning. This suggests that EE promotes formation of longer lasting object recognition memory, allowing a longer time window during which saving is present.

AB  - Abstract
Striatal-enriched phosphatase 61 (STEP61) is a member of intracellular protein tyrosine phosphatases, which is involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and a line of neuropsychiatric disorders. This protein tyrosine phosphatase is also abundant in pain-related spinal cord dorsal horn neurons. However, whether and how this tyrosine phosphatase modulates the nociceptive plasticity and behavioral hypersensitivity remain largely unknown. The present study recorded the long-term potentiation (LTP) of primary afferent C fiber-evoked field potentials in vivo in superficial dorsal horn of rats, and tested the possible role of STEP61 in spinal LTP. We found that LTP induction significantly increased STEP61 phosphorylation at Ser221 residue, a key molecular event that has been shown to impair the phosphatase activity. The STEP61 hypoactivity allowed for the activation of three substrates, GluN2B subunit-containing N-methyl-d-aspartate-subtype glutamate receptors, Src-family protein tyrosine kinase member Fyn and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, through which the thresholds for LTP induction were noticeably decreased. To reinstate STEP61 activity, we overexpressed wild-type STEP61 [STEP61(WT)] in spinal dorsal horn, finding that STEP61(WT) completely blunted LTP induction. Behavioral tests showed that LTP blockade by STEP61(WT) correlated with a long-lasting alleviation of thermal hypersensitivity and mechanical allodynia induced by chronic constriction injury of sciatic nerves. These data implicated that STEP61 exerted a negative control over spinal nociceptive plasticity, which might have therapeutic benefit in pathological pain.

AB  - Abstract
Developmental alcohol exposure causes a host of cognitive and neuroanatomical abnormalities, one of which is impaired executive functioning resulting from medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) damage. This study determined whether third-trimester equivalent alcohol exposure reduced the number of mPFC GABAergic parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons, hypothesized to play an important role in local inhibition of the mPFC. The impact on passive avoidance learning and the therapeutic role of aerobic exercise in adulthood was also explored. Male C57BL/6J mice received either saline or 5 g/kg ethanol (two doses, two hours apart) on PD 5, 7, and 9. On PD 35, animals received a running wheel or remained sedentary for 48 days before behavioral testing and perfusion on PD 83. The number of PV+ interneurons was stereologically measured in three separate mPFC subregions: infralimbic, prelimbic and anterior cingulate cortices (ACC). Neonatal alcohol exposure decreased number of PV+ interneurons and volume of the ACC, but the other regions of the mPFC were spared. Alcohol impaired acquisition, but not retrieval of passive avoidance, and had no effect on motor performance on the rotarod. Exercise had no impact on PV+ cell number, mPFC volume, or acquisition of passive avoidance, but enhanced retrieval in both control and alcohol-exposed groups, and enhanced rotarod performance in the control mice. Results support the hypothesis that part of the behavioral deficits associated with developmental alcohol exposure are due to reduced PV+ interneurons in the ACC, but unfortunately exercise does not appear to be able to reverse any of these deficits.

The present experiments investigated the involvement of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) in consolidation of extinction in a habit memory task. Adult male Long-Evans rats were initially trained in a food-reinforced response learning version of a plus-maze task and were subsequently given extinction training in which the food was removed from the maze. In experiment 1, immediately after the first day of extinction training, rats received bilateral intra-DLS injections of the NMDA receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5; 2 µg/side) or physiological saline. In experiment 2, immediately following the first day of extinction training, animals were given intra-DLS injections of NMDA receptor partial agonist d-cycloserine (DCS; 10 or 20 µg/side) or saline. In both experiments, the number of perseverative trials (a trial in which a rat made the same previously reinforced body-turn response) and latency to reach the previously correct food well were used as measures of extinction behavior. Results indicated that post-training intra-DLS injections of AP5 impaired extinction. In contrast, post-training intra-DLS infusions of DCS (20 µg) enhanced extinction. Intra-DLS administration of AP5 or DCS given two hours after extinction training did not influence extinction of response learning, indicating that immediate post-training administration of AP5 and DCS specifically influenced consolidation of the extinction memory. The present results indicate a critical role for DLS NMDA receptors in modulating extinction of habit memory and may be relevant to developing therapeutic approaches to combat the maladaptive habits observed in human psychopathologies in which DLS-dependent memory has been implicated (e.g. drug addiction and relapse and obsessive compulsive disorder).

AB  - Abstract
Huntington’s disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder resulting from N-terminal polyglutamine expansion in the huntingtin protein. A relatively selective and early loss of medium spiny neurons in the striatum is a hallmark of HD neuropathology. Although the exact mechanism of mutant huntingtin-mediated neurodegeneration is unclear, recent evidence suggests that NMDA-receptor-mediated excitotoxicity is involved. Our previously published findings show that decreasing levels of the cdk5 activators, p35 and p25, reduces NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity in striatal neurons in vivo. In this study we directly examined the effect of reducing levels of p35 and p25 in the context of mutant huntingtin toxicity, using the B6 YAC128 mouse model of HD. Our findings demonstrate that deletion of a single allele of p35 in the B6 YAC128 mice results in an upregulation of Akt activity, and increases phosphorylation of mutant huntingtin at Ser421. Longitudinal behavioral analysis showed that this 50% reduction in p35 and p25 levels did not improve accelerating Rotarod performance in these YAC128 mice. However, a complete deletion of p35 normalized the accelerating Rotarod performance relative to their non-transgenic littermates at four months of age.

AB  - Abstract
Anxiety is differentially expressed across a continuum of stressful/fearful intensity, influenced by endocannabinoid systems and receptors. The hippocampus plays important roles in the regulation of affective behavior, emotion, and anxiety, as well as memory. Location of Cb1/Cb2 receptor action could be important in determining emotional valence, because while the dorsal hippocampus is involved in spatial memory and cognition, the ventral hippocampus has projections to the PFC, BNST, amygdala, and HPA axis, and is important for emotional responses to stress. During repeated social defeat in a Stress-Alternatives Model arena (SAM; an oval open field with escape portals only large enough for smaller mice), smaller C57BL6/N mice are subject to fear conditioning (tone = CS), and attacked by novel larger aggressive CD1 mice (US) over four daily (5 min) trials. Each SAM trial presents an opportunity for escape or submission, with stable behavioral responses established by the second day of interaction. Additional groups had access to a running wheel. Social aggression plus fear conditioning stimulates enhanced Cb2 receptor gene expression in the dorsal CA1, dorsal and ventral dentate gyrus subregions in animals displaying a submissive behavioral phenotype. Escape behavior is associated with reduced Cb2 expression in the dorsal CA1 region, with freezing and escape latency correlated with mRNA levels. Escaping and submitting animals with access to running wheels had increased Cb2 mRNA in dorsal DG/CA1. These results suggest that the Cb2 receptor system is rapidly induced during anxiogenic social interactions plus fear conditioning or exercise; with responses potentially adaptive for coping mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract
Functions of the hippocampus are segregated along its long axis and emerging evidence shows that the local circuitry is specialized accordingly. Sharp waves (SPWs) and ripples are a basic hippocampal network activity implicated in memory processing. Using recordings from the CA1 field of both dorsal (DH) and ventral (VH) rat hippocampal slices we found that SPWs are larger, shorter and occur much more frequently in the VH than in the DH. Clusters of SPWs (i.e. multiple consecutive events grouped in sequences that depend on NMDA receptors) occur with higher probability in the VH and the frequency of occurrence of consecutive intra-cluster events is higher in the VH (∼10 Hz) than in the DH (∼5 Hz). The ripple oscillation displays higher amplitude and frequency in the VH than in DH and the associated multiunit firing peaks at a later phase of the ripple waves in the VH than in the DH. Isolated unit complex spike bursts display a significantly lower number of spikes and longer inter-spike intervals in the VH than in the DH suggesting that the synaptically driven neuronal excitability is lower in the VH. We propose that to some extent these differences result from the relatively higher network excitability of the VH compared with DH. Furthermore, they might reflect specializations that provide the local circuitries of the DH and VH with the required optimal ability for synaptic plasticity and might also suggest that the VH could be a favored site of SPW-Rs initiation.

AB  - Abstract
TRPV4 ion channels have a broad expression profile and were shown to contribute to enhanced pain sensation in inflammation. Directly blocking TRPV4 might run the risk of interfering with normal physiology, and has prompted to explore the interaction with the scaffolding protein AKAP79, an approach successfully used for TRPV1 channels. HEK293t cells express AKAP79, additional transfection did not sensitize human TRPV4. Application of trypsin facilitated responses to TRPV4 agonist GSK1016790A. Using a specific protease-activated receptor 2 agonist, involvement of an A-kinase anchoring protein in TRPV4 activation was demonstrated by inhibition with AKAP inhibitor peptide Ht31. TRPV4 has substantial sequence similarity to TRPV1 in the range interacting with AKAP79. A synthetic peptide, resembling these amino acids and extended by a positive region for transmembrane uptake, was tested. Sensitization of TRPV4 responses could be reduced after exposure to this 771–781::TAT peptide but not by a scrambled control peptide. This validates the concept of targeting the interaction between TRPV4 and AKAP79 and controlling increased TRPV4 activity.

AB  - Abstract
Neonatal brain injury is a problem of global importance. To date, no causal therapies are available. A substance with considerable therapeutic potential is the endogenous neuropeptide secretoneurin (SN), which has proven to be beneficial in adult stroke. The aim of this study was to assess its effect in neonatal hypoxic–ischemic brain injury models. In vitro, primary hippocampal neurons were pre-treated with vehicle, 1 µg/ml, 10 µg/ml, or 50 µg/ml SN and subjected to oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) for six hours. Cell death was assessed after a 24-h recovery period. In vivo, seven day-old CD-1 mice underwent unilateral common carotid artery ligation and were exposed to 8% oxygen/nitrogen for 20 min. SN plasma concentrations were serially determined by ELISA after insult. One hour after hypoxia, a subgroup of animals was treated with vehicle or SN. SN plasma concentrations significantly decreased 48 h after insult. The number of caspase-3-positive cells was significantly lower in the hypoxic–ischemic hemisphere in the thalamus of SN-treated animals. In the hypoxic-only hemisphere administration of SN significantly reduced the number of caspase-3-positive cells (in cortex, white matter, hippocampus, thalamus and striatum) and inhibited microglial cell activation in the thalamus. SN has neuroprotective potential in neonatal brain injury. Its main action seems to be inhibition of apoptosis in the aftermath of the insult, predominantly in the hypoxic-only hemisphere. This might be explained by the less pronounced injury in this hemisphere, where blood flow and thus nutrient supply are maintained.

AB  - Abstract
The intrinsic value of an action refers to the inherent sense that experiencing a behavior is enjoyable even if it has no explicit outcome. Previous research has suggested that a common valuation mechanism within the reward network may be responsible for processing the intrinsic value of achieving both the outcome and external rewards. However, how the intrinsic value of action is neurally represented remains unknown. We hypothesized that the intrinsic value of action is determined by an action-outcome contingency indicating the behavior is controllable and that the outcome of the action can be evaluated by this feedback. Consequently, the reward network should be activated, reflecting the generation of the intrinsic value of action. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) investigation of a stopwatch game in which the action-outcome contingency was manipulated. This experiment involved 36 healthy volunteers and four versions of a stopwatch game that manipulated controllability (the feeling that participants were controlling the stopwatch themselves) and outcome (a signal allowing participants to see the result of their action). A free-choice experiment was administered after the fMRI to explore preference levels for each game. The results showed that the stopwatch game with the action-outcome contingency evoked a greater degree of enjoyment because the participants chose this condition over those that lacked such a contingency. The ventral striatum and midbrain were activated only when action-outcome contingency was present. Thus, the intrinsic value of action was represented by an increase in ventral striatal and midbrain activation.

AB  - Abstract
A number of studies have shown that sensory inputs from the hand can have a profound effect in stabilizing upright posture. This suggests that the central nervous system can extract information about body motion and external forces acting on the body from cutaneous sensory signals. We have recently shown that the central nervous system determines the direction of an unpredictable force applied to the hand so rapidly that it is able to activate ankle muscles in advance of the perturbing effect that this force has at the ankles. In this study we investigate whether this rapid change in activation of lower limb muscles is an invariant response determined by the pattern of somatosensory information arising from sensory receptors in the hand or whether it adapts to changes in postural stability. We manipulated lateral stability of upright stance by changing stance width which had no effect on the activation of upper limb muscles or hand kinematics, but produced profound changes in the activation patterns of lower limb muscles when perturbations were in the medial/lateral direction without affecting the activation patterns of muscles when perturbations were in the anterior/posterior direction.

AB  - Abstract
Premature or ill full-term infants are subject to a number of noxious procedures as part of their necessary medical care. Although we know that human infants show neural changes in response to such procedures, we know little of the sensory or affective brain circuitry activated by pain. In rodent models, the focus has been on spinal cord and, more recently, midbrain and medulla. The present study assesses activation of brain circuits using manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI). Uptake of manganese, a paramagnetic contrast agent that is transported across active synapses and along axons, was measured in response to a hindpaw injection of dilute formalin in 12-day-old rat pups, the age at which rats begin to show aversion learning and which is roughly the equivalent of full-term human infants. Formalin induced the oft-reported biphasic response at this age and induced a conditioned aversion to cues associated with its injection, thus demonstrating the aversiveness of the stimulation. Morphometric analyses, structural equation modeling and co-expression analysis showed that limbic and sensory paths were activated, the most prominent of which were the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hypothalamus, several brainstem structures, and the cerebellum. Therefore, both sensory and affective circuits, which are activated by pain in the adult, can also be activated by noxious stimulation in 12-day-old rat pups.

AB  - Abstract
The use of the existing endogenous neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the brains of adult mammalian animals is challenging for cell therapy in treating Parkinson’s disease (PD). Previous studies have indicated that there is a low level of neurogenesis in the substantia nigra (SN) of adult mice. To assess the regenerative/neurogenic capacity of NPCs following an intranigral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), the proliferation and differentiation of subventricular zone (SVZ)- and midbrain-derived NPCs were investigated, and the origin of SN newborn dopaminergic neurons was traced by using Nestin-CreERTM::ROSA26-LacZ mice and constructing a plasmid CD133-Promoter2-Cre. Our results showed that an intranigral injection of 6-OHDA-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons produced a significant increase in the SVZ-derived NPCs of the third ventricle (3V), cerebral aqueduct (Aq), and their surrounding regions. The SN newly generated dopaminergic neurons might contribute a little to an incomplete recovery of the nigrostriatal system. In addition, we found that SN newborn dopaminergic neurons were mainly derived from the migration and differentiation of the NPCs in the 3V- and Aq-SVZ and their adjacent regions. Thus, it will become an ideal strategy to treat PD by promoting the proliferation and differentiation of endogenous NPCs.

AB  - Abstract
Diabetes mellitus represents a group of metabolic diseases that are characterized by hyperglycemia caused by either lack of insulin production or a reduced ability to respond to insulin. It is estimated that there were 347 million people worldwide who suffered from diabetes in 2008 and incidence is predicted to double by 2050. Neuropathy is the most common complication of long-term diabetes and approximately 30% of these subjects develop chronic neuropathic pain. A distinct acute, severe form of neuropathic pain, called insulin neuritis or treatment-induced painful neuropathy of diabetes (TIND), may also occur shortly after initiation of intensive glycemic control, with an incidence rate of up to 10.9%.

The pathological mechanisms leading to TIND, which is mostly unresponsive to analgesics, are not yet understood, impeding the development of therapies. Studies to date have been clinical and with limited cohorts of patients. In the current study, we developed chronic and acute insulin-induced neuropathic pain in mice with type 2 insulin-resistant diabetes. Furthermore, we determined that insulin-induced acute allodynia is independent of glycemia levels, can also be induced with Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF1) and be prevented by inhibition of AKT, providing evidence of an insulin/IGF1 signaling pathway-based mechanism for TIND. This mouse model is useful for the elucidation of mechanisms contributing to TIND and for the testing of new therapeutic approaches to treat TIND.

AB  - Abstract
A challenge in working with preclinical models of neurodegeneration has been how to non-invasively monitor disease progression. Neurofilament proteins are established axonal damage markers and have been found to be elevated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood from patients with neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD) and tauopathies. We hypothesized that CSF neurofilament light (NF-L) can be used to track progression of neurodegeneration and potentially monitor the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents in preclinical development. To substantiate this, we examined whether changes in NF-L levels in brain, plasma, and CSF reflect the changing disease status of preclinical models of neurodegeneration. Using Western Blot and ELISA we characterized NF-L and disease-related proteins in brain, CSF and plasma samples from Tg4510 mice (tauopathy/AD), MitoPark mice (PD), and their age-matched control littermates. We found that CSF NF-L clearly discriminates Tg4510 from control littermates, which was not observed for the MitoPark model. However, both Tg4510 and MitoPark showed altered expression and solubilization of NFs compared to control littermates. We found a significant correlation between CSF NF-L and plasma NF-L in Tg4510, suggesting a similar biomarker potential of plasma NF-L. Also, CSF NF-L correlated significantly with tau in Tg4510 brains, suggesting a surrogate biomarker potential of CSF NF-L. Overall, our findings provide further evidence that NF-L correlates with disease severity and our results suggests, that CSF NF-L has utility as a surrogate or adjunct biomarker for neurodegeneration in the Tg4510 model, but independent validation is warranted.

The effects of endogenous opioid peptide antagonists on panic-related responses are controversial. Using elevated mazes and a prey-versus-predator paradigm, we investigated the involvement of the endogenous opioid peptide-mediated system in the modulation of anxiety- and panic attack-induced responses and innate fear-induced antinociception in the present work. Wistar rats were intraperitoneally pretreated with either physiological saline or naloxone at different doses and were subjected to either the elevated plus- or T-maze test or confronted by Crotalus durissus terrificus. The defensive behaviors of the rats were recorded in the presence of the predator and at 24 h after the confrontation, when the animals were placed in the experimental enclosure without the rattlesnake. The peripheral non-specific blockade of opioid receptors had a clear anxiolytic-like effect on the rats subjected to the elevated plus-maze but not on those subjected to the elevated T-maze; however, a clear panicolytic-like effect was observed, i.e., the defensive behaviors decreased, and the prey-versus-predator interaction responses evoked by the presence of the rattlesnakes increased. A similar effect was noted when the rats were exposed to the experimental context in the absence of the venomous snake. After completing all tests, the naloxone-treated groups exhibited less anxiety/fear-induced antinociception than the control group, as measured by the tail-flick test. These findings demonstrate the anxiolytic and panicolytic-like effects of opioid receptor blockade. In addition, the fearlessness behavior displayed by preys treated with naloxone at higher doses enhanced the defensive behavioral responses of venomous snakes.

AB  - Abstract
Exercise has been proven to promote learning and memory, and is closely related to increased adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. In our study, the β subunit of Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3β) can be significantly regulated by exercise, and the modulation of GSK3β activity can enhance adult neurogenesis and memory. To explore the mechanism by which exercise can improve cognitive function and adult neurogenesis, and the role GSK3β plays in this process, we established a mouse model of voluntary exercise to examine the expression and activity of GSK3β, and its associated signaling pathways, in the hippocampus dentate gyrus. The results showed an obvious increase in adult neurogenesis and cognitive functions, and the up-regulation of GSK3β, after exercise. The activity of the insulin pathway, which negatively regulates GSK3β, was also increased. Moreover, our results showed that the dopamine D1 receptor (DARP D1) pathway and adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) were also activated, which indicates a relationship between GSK3β and neurogenesis. Overall, our findings demonstrated that voluntary exercise promotes cognition and neurogenesis in the adult mouse dentate gyrus by the regulation of GSK3β expression and activity, which may be implemented through the DARP D1 receptor-signaling pathway.

AB  - Abstract
As the predominant mediator of the delayed rectifier current, KV2.1 is an important regulator of neuronal excitability. KV2.1, however, also plays a well-established role in apoptotic cell death. Apoptogenic stimuli induce syntaxin-dependent trafficking of KV2.1, resulting in an augmented delayed rectifier current that acts as a conduit for K+ efflux required for pro-apoptotic protease/nuclease activation. Recent evidence suggests that KV2.1 somato-dendritic clusters regulate the formation of endoplasmic reticulum–plasma membrane junctions that function as scaffolding sites for plasma membrane trafficking of ion channels, including KV2.1. However, it is unknown whether KV2.1 somato-dendritic clusters are required for apoptogenic trafficking of KV2.1. By overexpression of a protein derived from the C-terminus of the cognate channel KV2.2 (KV2.2CT), we induced calcineurin-independent disruption of KV2.1 somato-dendritic clusters in rat cortical neurons, without altering the electrophysiological properties of the channel. We observed that KV2.2CT-expressing neurons are less susceptible to oxidative stress-induced cell death. Critically, expression of KV2.2CT effectively blocked the increased current density of the delayed rectifier current associated with oxidative injury, supporting a vital role of KV2.1-somato-dendritic clusters in apoptogenic increases in KV2.1-mediated currents.

The concentrations of fourteen neurochemicals associated with metabolism, neurotransmission, antioxidant capacity, and cellular structure were measured noninvasively from two distinct brain regions using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Seventeen young adults (age 19–22 years) and sixteen cognitively normal older adults (age 70–88 years) were scanned. To increase sensitivity and specificity, 1H magnetic resonance spectra were obtained at the ultra-high field of 7 T and at ultra-short echo time. The concentrations of neurochemicals were determined using water as an internal reference and accounting for gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid content of the volume of interest. In the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), the concentrations of neurochemicals associated with energy (i.e., creatine plus phosphocreatine), membrane turnover (i.e., choline containing compounds), and gliosis (i.e., myo-inositol) were higher in the older adults while the concentrations of N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) and phosphorylethanolamine (PE) were lower. In the occipital cortex (OCC), the concentration of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), a marker of neuronal viability, concentrations of the neurotransmitters Glu and NAAG, antioxidant ascorbate (Asc), and PE were lower in the older adults while the concentration of choline containing compounds was higher. Altogether, these findings shed light on how the human brain ages differently depending on region.

AB  - Abstract
Major depression is a common cause of chronic disability. Despite decades of efforts, no equivocally accepted animal model is available for studying depression. We tested the validity of a new model based on the three-hit concept of vulnerability and resilience. Genetic predisposition (hit 1, mutation of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, PACAP gene), early-life adversity (hit 2, 180-min maternal deprivation, MD180) and chronic variable mild stress (hit 3, CVMS) were combined. Physical, endocrinological, behavioral and functional morphological tools were used to validate the model. Body- and adrenal weight changes as well as corticosterone titers proved that CVMS was effective. Forced swim test indicated increased depression in CVMS PACAP heterozygous (Hz) mice with MD180 history, accompanied by elevated anxiety level in marble burying test. Corticotropin-releasing factor neurons in the oval division of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis showed increased FosB expression, which was refractive to CVMS exposure in wild-type and Hz mice. Urocortin1 neurons became over-active in CMVS-exposed PACAP knock out (KO) mice with MD180 history, suggesting the contribution of centrally projecting Edinger–Westphal nucleus to the reduced depression and anxiety level of stressed KO mice. Serotoninergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus lost their adaptation ability to CVMS in MD180 mice. In conclusion, the construct and face validity criteria suggest that MD180 PACAP HZ mice on CD1 background upon CVMS may be used as a reliable model for the three-hit theory.

AB  - Abstract
Brain microvascular endothelial cell (BMEC) injury induced by ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) is the initial stage of blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, which results in a poor prognosis in ischemic stroke patients. Autophagy has been shown to have protective effects on BMECs against cerebral ischemic insults. However, molecular mechanism of BMEC autophagy during I/R is unclear. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as new factors involved in cell autophagy. LncRNA Malat1 is one of the most highly upregulated I/R or OGD/R-responsive endothelial lncRNA and plays a protective role in BMECs against cerebral ischemic insults. Oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) is used to mimic I/R injury in vitro. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that Malat1 might play a protective role by enhancing BMEC autophagy. We performed GFP-LC3 puncta formation, LC3 conversion, p62 expression, and cell death assays, and the results were consistent with our hypothesis that Malat1 promoted BMEC autophagy and survival under OGD/R condition. We further explored the molecular mechanisms by which Malat1 exerted regulatory effects, and found that Malat1 served as an endogenous sponge to downregulate miR-26b expression by binding directly to miR-26b. Furthermore, Malat1 overturned the inhibitory effect of miR-26b on BMEC autophagy and survival, which involved in promoting the expression of miR-26b target ULK2. Collectively, our study illuminated a new Malat1-miR-26b-ULK2 regulatory axis in which Malat1 served as a competing endogenous RNA by sponging miR-26b and upregulating ULK2 expression, thereby promoting BMEC autophagy and survival under OGD/R condition.

AB  - Abstract
Tauopathies are a class of neurodegenerative diseases associated with the pathological aggregation of tau protein in the human brain. Although numerous studies in mouse models of Alzheimer disease (AD) have shown a correlation among diet, beta-amyloid and AD onset, little is known about the impact of diet on Tau. We investigated whether a low fat-protein diet (LFPD) may improve lifespan, cognitive and locomotor activity in P301L-tg mouse model of tauopathy. Our data indicate that LFPD has a beneficial effect on these parameters. Tg mice fed with standard diet shown a decrease in body weight, food intake and survival rate if compared to wild type animals. In contrast, LFPD counteracted weight loss, increased mortality and ameliorated cognitive and locomotor performances in tg mice. LFPD also reduced the abnormal accumulation of agglomerates of P-Tau (pathological features of tauopathies) and the expression of apoptotic markers (i.e., TUNEL immunopositive neurons) in the prefrontal cerebral cortex and hippocampus of P301L-tg mice. Interestingly, some of these effects are sex-dependent. For instance, tg females, but not males, fed with LFPD had a significant increase of body weight and a reduction of P-Tau agglomerates compared to tg fed with standard diet. These changes correlated with a more pronounced improvement of cognition and locomotor activity in females than in male tg fed with LFPD. Altogether, these results suggest a sex dependent neuroprotective effect of LFPD in P301L-tg mice, suggesting that lifestyle intervention strategies may be clinically relevant for delaying the onset of cognitive impairment and dementia, especially in females.

AB  - Abstract
Wntless (Wls) is implicated in the Wnt signaling pathway by regulating the secretion of Wnt molecules. During brain development, Wls is expressed in the isthmic organizer (ISO) and rhombic lip (RL). Wls regulates Wnt1 secretion at the ISO which is required to induce midbrain–hindbrain structures. However, Wls function in the RL is not known. Here, we employed Nestin-cre to delete Wls specifically in the RL during mid-gestation. The loss-of-Wls leads to an abnormal RL during development and cerebellar vermis hypoplasia at birth. The Wls conditional knockout (cKO) has rudimentary foliation with an absence of Bergmann glia fibers in the external germinal layer (EGL). The Wls-cKO cerebellum also exhibits ectopia of several cell types and aberrations in granule cell organization. Finally, there is a loss of 85% of unipolar brush cells. From these findings, Wls-expressing cells in the rhombic lip are implicated in the orchestration of cerebellar development.

AB  - Abstract
The A5 area at the ventrolateral pons contains noradrenergic neurons connected with other medullary areas involved in the cardiorespiratory control. Its contribution to the cardiorespiratory regulation was previously evidenced in anesthetized conditions. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of the A5 noradrenergic neurons to the basal and chemoreflex control of the sympathetic and respiratory activities in unanesthetized conditions. A5 noradrenergic neurons were lesioned using microinjections of anti-dopamine β-hydroxylase saporin (anti-DβH-SAP). After 7–8 days, we evaluated the arterial pressure levels, heart rate and minute ventilation in freely moving adult rats (280–350 g) as well as recorded from thoracic sympathetic (tSN) and phrenic nerves (PN) using the arterially perfused in situ preparation of juvenile rats (80–90 g). Baseline cardiovascular, sympathetic and respiratory parameters were similar between control (n = 7–8) and A5-lesioned rats (n = 5–6) in both experimental preparations. In adult rats, lesions of A5 noradrenergic neurons did not modify the reflex cardiorespiratory adjustments to hypoxia (7% O2) and hypercapnia (7% CO2). In the in situ preparations, the sympatho-excitation, but not the PN reflex response, elicited by either the stimulation of peripheral chemoreceptors (ΔtSN: 110 ± 12% vs 58 ± 8%, P &lt; 0.01) or hypercapnia (ΔtSN: 9.5 ± 1.4% vs 3.9 ± 1.7%, P &lt; 0.05) was attenuated in A5-lesioned rats compared to controls. Our data demonstrated that A5 noradrenergic neurons are part of the circuitry recruited for the processing of sympathetic response to hypoxia and hypercapnia in unanesthetized conditions.

AB  - Abstract
The classic hypothesis presents the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as the “third circulation,” which flows from the brain ventricles through the entire CSF system to the cortical subarachnoid space to eventually be passively absorbed into the superior sagittal sinus through arachnoid granulations. The choroid plexus (CP) represents a key organ in the classic CSF physiology and a powerful biological pump, which exclusively secretes CSF. Thereby, the CP is considered to be responsible for CSF pressure regulation and hydrocephalus development. This article thoroughly analyzes the role of the CP in the CSF dynamics, presenting arguments in favor of the thesis that the CPs are neither biological pumps nor the main site of CSF secretion; that they do not participate in regulation of ICP/CSF pressure; are not the reason for the existence of hydrostatic pressure gradient in the CSF system and that this gradient is not permanent (disappeared in the horizontal position); and that they do not generate imagined unidirectional CSF circulation, hydrocephalus development and increased ICP/CSF pressure. The classic hypothesis cannot provide an explanation for these controversies but the recently formulated Bulat-Klarica-Orešković hypothesis can. According to this hypothesis, CSF production and absorption (CSF exchange) are constant and present everywhere in the CSF system, and although the CSF is partially produced by the CP, it is mainly formed as a consequence of water filtration between the capillaries and interstitial fluid.

AB  - Abstract
Emerging research provides strong evidence that activation of CNS glial cells occurs in neurological diseases and brain injury and results in elevated production of neuroimmune factors. These factors can contribute to pathophysiological processes that lead to altered CNS function. Recently, studies have also shown that both acute and chronic alcohol consumption can produce activation of CNS glial cells and the production of neuroimmune factors, particularly the chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2). The consequences of alcohol-induced increases in CCL2 levels in the CNS have yet to be fully elucidated. Our studies focus on the hypothesis that increased levels of CCL2 in the CNS produce neuroadaptive changes that modify the actions of alcohol on the CNS. We utilized behavioral testing in transgenic mice that express elevated levels of CCL2 to test this hypothesis. The increased level of CCL2 in the transgenic mice involves increased astrocyte expression. Transgenic mice and their non-transgenic littermate controls were subjected to one of two alcohol exposure paradigms, a two-bottle choice alcohol drinking procedure that does not produce alcohol dependence or a chronic intermittent alcohol procedure that produces alcohol dependence. Several behavioral tests were carried out including the Barnes maze, Y-maze, cued and contextual conditioned fear test, light–dark transfer, and forced swim test. Comparisons between alcohol naïve, non-dependent, and alcohol-dependent CCL2 transgenic and non-transgenic mice show that elevated levels of CCL2 in the CNS interact with alcohol in tests for alcohol drinking, spatial learning, and associative learning.

AB  - Abstract
The septum is an evolutionarily well-conserved part of the limbic system. It is known to be involved in many aspects of social behavior and is considered a key node of the social behavior network, together with the preoptic area. Involvement of these two brain regions has been recently observed in newly hatched chicks exposed to the natural motion of a living conspecific. However, it is unknown whether these areas respond also to simple motion cues that elicit animacy perception in humans and social predispositions in chicks. For example, naïve chicks are attracted by visual objects that appear to spontaneously change their speed (an index of self-propulsion, typical of animate creatures). Here we show that the right septum and the preoptic area of newly hatched visually naïve chicks exposed to speed changes have higher neuronal activity (revealed by c-Fos expression), compared with that of chicks exposed to constant motion. We thus found an involvement of these two areas in the perception of motion cues associated with animacy in newly hatched chicks without any previous visual experience. This demonstrates their early involvement in processing simple motion cues that allow the detection of animate creatures and elicit social predispositions in this animal model, as well as preferential attention in human infants and the perception of animacy in human adults.

AB  - Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a debilitating neurodegenerative illness, is characterized by neuronal cell loss, mental deficits, and abnormalities in several neurotransmitter and protein systems. AD is also associated with visual disturbances, but their causes remain unidentified. We hypothesize that the visual disturbances stem from retinal changes, particularly changes in the retinal cholinergic system, and that the etiology in the retina parallels the etiology in the rest of the brain. To test our hypothesis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were employed to assess changes in acetylcholine receptor (AChR) gene expression, number of retinal cells, and astrocytic gliosis in the Transgenic Swedish, Dutch and Iowa (Tg-SwDI) mouse model as compared to age-matched wild-type (WT). We observed that Tg-SwDI mice showed an initial upregulation of AChR gene expression early on (young adults and middle-aged adults), but a downregulation later on (old adults). Furthermore, transgenic animals displayed significant cell loss in the photoreceptor layer and inner retina of the young adult animals, as well as specific cholinergic cell loss, and increased astrocytic gliosis in the middle-aged adult and old adult groups. Our results suggest that the changes observed in AD cerebrum are also present in the retina and may be, at least in part, responsible for the visual deficits associated with the disease.

AB  - Abstract
Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are structures of extracellular matrix molecules surrounding the cell bodies and proximal dendrites of certain neurons. While PNNs are present throughout the mouse cerebral cortex, recent studies have shown that the components differ among cortical sub-regions and layers, suggesting region-specific functions. Parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV neurons) may be important regulators of cortical plasticity during the early “critical period” that is sensitive to sensory input. Here we examined the distribution and developmental functions of PNN components associated with PV neurons in the somatosensory cortex during the critical period. Aggrecan, brevican, neurocan, phosphacan, and tenascin-R were identified as PNN components in the mouse somatosensory cortex. High-magnification analysis revealed that some lectin Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA)-reactive molecules did not co-localize with monoclonal antibody Cat-315 recognition molecules around the cell body. During postnatal development, Cat-315-positive (Cat-315+) PNNs appeared later than PNNs binding to the lectin WFA (WFA+ PNNs). These WFA+ PNNs changed from granular-like to reticular-like structures during normal cortical development, while this transition was delayed by sensory deprivation. This study indicates that the formation of reticular-like WFA+ PNNs is dependent on sensory experience in the mouse somatosensory cortex. We suggest that Cat-315+ molecules and WFA expression in PNNs are involved in the early critical period of input-dependent cortical plasticity.

AB  - Abstract
Brain developmental disorders such as lissencephaly can result from faulty neuronal migration and differentiation during the formation of the mammalian neocortex. The cerebral cortex is a modular structure, where developmentally, newborn neurons are generated as a neuro-epithelial sheet and subsequently differentiate, migrate and organize into their final positions in the cerebral cortical plate via a process involving both tangential and radial migration. The specific role of Mest, an imprinted gene, in neuronal migration has not been previously studied. In this work, we reduced expression of Mest with in utero electroporation of neuronal progenitors in the developing embryonic mouse neocortex. Reduction of Mest levels by shRNA significantly reduced the number of neurons migrating to the cortical plate. Also, Mest-knockdown disrupted the transition of bipolar neurons into multipolar neurons migrating out of the sub-ventricular zone region. The migrating neurons also adopted a more tangential migration pattern upon knockdown of the Mest message, losing their potential to attach to radial glia cells, required for radial migration. The differentiation and migration properties of neurons via Wnt-Akt signaling were affected by Mest changes. In addition, miR-335, encoded in a Mest gene intron, was identified as being responsible for blocking the default tangential migration of the neurons. Our results suggest that Mest and its intron product, miR-335, play important roles in neuronal migration with Mest regulating the morphological transition of primary neurons required in the formation of the mammalian neocortex.

AB  - Abstract
The somatosensory information from the orofacial region, including the periodontal ligament (PDL), is processed in a manner that differs from that used for other body somatosensory information in the related cortices. It was reported that electrical stimulation to rat PDL elicited activation of the insular oral region (IOR) and the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortices. However, the physiological relationship between S1 and S2/IOR is not well understood. To address this issue, we performed in vivo optical imaging using a voltage-sensitive dye. Our results demonstrated that the electrical stimulation to the PDL of the mandibular incisor evoked the simultaneous activation of S1 and the S2/IOR. The stimulation to the initial response area of the S1 evoked responses in the S2/IOR, and vice versa. An injection of tetrodotoxin (TTX) to the cortical region between S1 and S2/IOR attenuated such elicited responses only in the non-stimulated cortical partner site. The cortico-cortical interaction between S1 and S2/IOR was suppressed by the application of TTX, indicating that these two cortical regions bi-directionally communicate the signal processing of PDL sensations. An injection of FluoroGold™ (FG) to the initial response area in S1 or the S2/IOR showed that FG-positive cells were scattered in the non-injected cortical counterpart. This morphological result demonstrated the presence of a bi-directional intracortical connection between the initial response areas in S1 and the S2/IOR. These findings suggest the presence of a mutual connection between S1 and the S2/IOR as an intracortical signal processing network for orofacial nociception.

Rapamycin (RAPA), an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), exhibits a high neuroprotective action against neurodegenerative diseases in mouse models. Since neuroinflammation has been shown to be involved in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) development and progression, the aim of this study was to examine the anti-inflammatory role of RAPA in AD in vivo and in vitro, and investigate the underlying mechanisms. We found that amyloid-β (Aβ) induced neuronal inflammation and a remarkable increase in mTOR activity in in-vivo and in-vitro models of inflammation, suggesting the critical role of mTOR signaling in neuronal inflammation. In addition, administration of RAPA was found to down-regulate mTOR, p-mTOR, Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) p65, p-p65, TNF-α, IL-1β and Bax protein expression in Aβ25–35- or lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-treated mice and cultured Neuro-2a (N2a) cells. Moreover, RAPA disrupted Aβ25–35-induced nuclear translocation of mTOR and NF-κB. Our findings indicate that RAPA inhibits Aβ25–35- or LPS-induced neuronal inflammation through suppressing mTOR signaling and reducing nuclear import of NF-κB.

AB  - Abstract
Corticotropin-releasing hormone release is the final common pathway of stress-associated neuroendocrine responses. This study tested how corticotropin-releasing hormone modulates airway vagal preganglionic neurons. Airway vagal preganglionic neurons in neonatal rats were retrogradely labeled with fluorescent dye and identified in medullary slices, and their responses to corticotropin-releasing hormone (200 nmol L−1) were examined using whole-cell patch clamp. The results show that under current clamp, corticotropin-releasing hormone (200 nmol L−1) depolarized airway vagal preganglionic neurons and significantly increased the rate of their spontaneous firing. Under voltage clamp, corticotropin-releasing hormone caused a tonic inward current and significantly facilitated the spontaneous glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs of these neurons. Corticotropin-releasing hormone had no impact on the spontaneous glycinergic inputs of these neurons. In the preexistence of tetrodotoxin (1 μmol L−1), corticotropin-releasing hormone had no impact on the miniature excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic currents, but still induced a tonic inward current and significantly increased the input resistance. The responses induced by corticotropin-releasing hormone were prevented by Antalarmin hydrochloride (50 μmol L−1), an antagonist of type 1 corticotropin-releasing hormone receptors, but insensitive to Astressin 2B (200 nmol L−1), an antagonist of type 2 corticotropin-releasing hormone receptors. These results suggest that corticotropin-releasing hormone excites airway vagal preganglionic neurons via activation of its type 1 receptors at multiple sites, which includes a direct postsynaptic excitatory action and presynaptic facilitation of both glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs. In stress, corticotropin-releasing hormone might be able to activate the airway vagal nerves and, consequently, participate in induction or exacerbation of airway disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a frequent complication of preterm newborns, resulting in cerebral palsy and cognitive handicap as well as hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy and periventricular leukomalacia. In this study, we investigated the restorative effect on neonatal IVH by umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSCs) cultured in serum-free medium (RM medium) for clinical application. UC-MSCs were cultured with αMEM medium supplemented with FBS or RM. A neonatal IVH mouse model at postnatal day 5 was generated by intraventricular injection of autologous blood, and mice were intravenously administered 1 × 105 UC-MSCs two days after IVH. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed at postnatal day 15, 22 and neurological behavioral measurements were performed at postnatal day 23, accompanied by histopathological analysis and cytokine bead assays in serum after IVH with or without UC-MSCs. Both UC-MSCs cultured with αMEM and RM met the criteria of MSCs and improved behavioral outcome of IVH mice. Moreover the RM group exhibited significant behavioral improvement compared to the control group. Histopathological analysis revealed UC-MSCs cultured with RM significantly attenuated periventricular reactive gliosis, hypomyelination, and periventricular cell death observed after IVH. Furthermore, human brain-derived neurotrophic factor and hepatocyte growth factor were elevated in the serum, cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue of neonatal IVH model mice 24 h after UC-MSCs administration. These results suggest UC-MSCs attenuate neonatal IVH by protecting gliosis and apoptosis of the injured brain, and intravenous injection of UC-MSCs cultured in RM may be feasible for neonatal IVH in clinic.

AB  - Abstract
Neurogenesis constitutively occurs in the olfactory epithelium of mammals, including humans. The fact that new neurons in the adult olfactory epithelium derive from resident neural stem/progenitor cells suggests a potential use for these cells in studies of neural diseases, as well as in neuronal cell replacement therapies. In this regard, some studies have proposed that the human olfactory epithelium is a source of neural stem/progenitor cells for autologous transplantation. Although these potential applications are interesting, it is important to understand the cell biology and/or whether human neural stem/progenitor cells in the olfactory epithelium sense external signals, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), that is also found in other pro-neurogenic microenvironments. BDNF plays a key role in several biological processes, including cell migration. Thus, we characterized human neural stem/progenitor cells derived from the olfactory epithelium (hNS/PCs-OE) and studied their in vitro migratory response to BDNF. In the present study, we determined that hNS/PCs-OE express the protein markers Nestin, Sox2, Ki67 and βIII-tubulin. Moreover, the doubling time of hNS/PCs-OE was approximately 38 h. Additionally, we found that hNS/PCs-OE express the BDNF receptor TrkB, and pharmacological approaches showed that the BDNF-induced (40 ng/ml) migration of differentiated hNS/PCs-OE was affected by the compound K252a, which prevents TrkB activation. This observation was accompanied by changes in the number of vinculin adhesion contacts. Our results suggest that hNS/PCs-OE exhibit a migratory response to BDNF, accompanied by the turnover of adhesion contacts.

AB  - Abstract
In this study we tested whether a selective reward could affect the adaptation of saccadic eye movements in monkeys. We induced the adaptation of saccades by displacing the target of a horizontal saccade vertically as the eye moved toward it, thereby creating an apparent vertical dysmetria. The repeated upward target displacement caused the originally horizontal saccade to gradually deviate upward over the course of several hundred trials. We induced this directional adaptation in both right- and leftward saccades in every experiment (n = 20). In half of the experiments (n = 10), we rewarded monkeys only when they made leftward saccades and in the other half (n = 10) only for rightward saccades. The reaction time of saccades in the rewarded direction was shorter and we, like others, interpreted this change as a sign of the reward’s preferential effect in that direction. Saccades in the rewarded direction showed more rapid adaptation of their directions than did saccades in the non-rewarded direction, indicating that the selective reward increased the speed of saccade adaptation. The differences in adaptation speed were reflected in changes in saccade metrics, which were usually more noticeable in the deceleration phases of saccades than in their acceleration phases. Because previous studies have shown that the oculomotor cerebellum is involved with saccade deceleration and also participates in saccade adaptation, it is possible that selective reward could influence cerebellar plasticity.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic psychosocial stress modulates brain antioxidant systems and causes neuroinflammation that plays a role in the pathophysiology of depression. Although the antidepressant fluoxetine (FLX) represents the first-line treatment for depression and the atypical antipsychotic clozapine (CLZ) is considered as a second-line treatment for psychotic disorders, the downstream mechanisms of action of these treatments, beyond serotonergic or dopaminergic signaling, remain elusive. We examined behavioral changes, glutathione (GSH)-dependent defense and levels of proinflammatory mediators in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of adult male Wistar rats exposed to 21 days of chronic social isolation (CSIS). We also tested the ability of FLX (15 mg/kg/day) or CLZ (20 mg/kg/day), applied during CSIS, to prevent stress-induced changes. CSIS caused depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, compromised GSH-dependent defense, and induced nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation with a concomitant increase in cytosolic levels of proinflammatory mediators cyclooxigenase-2, interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the PFC. NF-κB activation and proinflammatory response in the PFC were not found in CSIS rats treated with FLX or CLZ. In contrast, only FLX preserved GSH content in CSIS rats. CLZ not only failed to protect against CSIS-induced GSH depletion, but it diminished its levels when applied to non-stressed rats. In conclusion, prefrontal cortical GSH depletion and the proinflammatory response underlying depressive- and anxiety-like states induced by CSIS were prevented by FLX. The protective effect of CLZ, which was equally effective as FLX on the behavioral level, was limited to proinflammatory components. Hence, different mechanisms underlie the protective effects of these two drugs in CSIS rats.

AB  - Abstract
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is based on neurovascular coupling, which allows inferring neuronal activity from hemodynamic changes. Spinal fMRI has been used to examine pain processes, although spinal neurovascular coupling has never been investigated. In addition, fluctuations in mean arterial pressure (MAP) occur during nociceptive stimulation and this may affect neurovascular coupling. The objective of this study was to examine neurovascular coupling in the rat spinal cord during nociceptive stimulation while MAP was manipulated by cervical spinal transection, which prevents nociception-related MAP increases. Six male Wistar rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (1.2–1.5%). Local field potentials (LFP) and spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) were recorded concurrently in the lumbar enlargement, where activity was evoked by electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve. In intact conditions, stimulation of graded intensity produced proportional changes in SCBF and LFP that were paralleled by similar changes in MAP. However, spinal transection almost abolished MAP changes (p &lt; 0.001), while SCBF and LFP responses were not significantly affected (p &gt; 0.3) and remained similarly coupled before and after spinal transection. This indicates that spinal hemodynamic changes reflect neuronal activity even when large fluctuations in MAP occur. This contrasts with results from previous studies on cerebral neurovascular coupling and suggests that spinal autoregulation might allow better adaptation to sudden MAP changes than cerebral autoregulation. Although assessment of the coupling between spinal neuronal activity and BOLD signal remains to be investigated, this study supports the use of spinal fMRI, based on the tight coupling between SCBF and LFP.

AB  - Abstract
Microglia are critical for developmental pruning and immune response to injury, and are implicated in facilitating neural plasticity. The rodent gustatory system is highly plastic, particularly during development, and outcomes following nerve injury are more severe in developing animals. The mechanisms underlying developmental plasticity in the taste system are largely unknown, making microglia an attractive candidate. To better elucidate microglia’s role in the taste system, we examined these cells in the rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (rNTS) during normal development and following transection of the chorda tympani taste nerve (CTX). Rats aged 5, 10, 25, or 50 days received unilateral CTX or no surgery and were sacrificed four days later. Brain tissue was stained for Iba1 or CD68, and both the density and morphology of microglia were assessed on the intact and transected sides of the rNTS. We found that the intact rNTS of neonatal rats (9–14 days) shows a high density of microglia, most of which appear reactive. By 29 days of age, microglia density significantly decreased to levels not significantly different from adults and microglia morphology had matured, with most cells appearing ramified. CD68-negative microglia density increased following CTX and was most pronounced for juvenile and adult rats. Our results show that microglia density is highest during times of normal gustatory afferent pruning. Furthermore, the quantity of the microglia response is higher in the mature system than in neonates. These findings link increased microglia presence with instances of normal developmental and injury induced alterations in the rNTS.

AB  - Abstract
The subthalamic nucleus (STN) shapes motor behavior and is important for the initiation and termination of movements. Here we ask whether the STN takes aggregated sensory information into account, in order to exert this function. To this end, local field potentials (LFP) were recorded in eight patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease and receiving deep-brain stimulation of the STN bilaterally. Bipolar recordings were obtained postoperatively from the externalized electrode leads. Patients were passively exposed to trains of auditory stimuli containing global deviants, local deviants or combined global/local deviants. The surface event-related potentials of the Parkinson’s patients as well as those of 19 age-matched healthy controls were characterized by a mismatch negativity (MMN) that was most pronounced for the global/local double deviants and less prominent for the other deviant conditions. The left and right STN LFPs similarly were modulated by stimulus deviance starting at about 100 ms post-stimulus onset. The MMN has been viewed as an index of an automatic auditory change detection system, more recently phrased in terms of predictive coding theory, which prepares the organism for attention shifts and for action. The LFP-data from the STN clearly demonstrate that the STN receives information on stimulus deviance, possibly as a means to bias the system to interrupt ongoing and to allow alternative actions.

AB  - Abstract
Chess involves the capacity to reason iteratively about potential intentional choices of an opponent and therefore involves high levels of explicit theory of mind [ToM] (i.e. ability to infer mental states of others) alongside clear, strategic rule-based decision-making. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used on 12 healthy male novice chess players to identify cortical regions associated with chess, ToM and empathizing. The blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) response for chess and empathizing tasks was extracted from each ToM region. Results showed neural overlap between ToM, chess and empathizing tasks in right-hemisphere temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) [BA40], left-hemisphere superior temporal gyrus [BA22] and posterior cingulate gyrus [BA23/31]. TPJ is suggested to underlie the capacity to reason iteratively about another’s internal state in a range of tasks. Areas activated by ToM and empathy included right-hemisphere orbitofrontal cortex and bilateral middle temporal gyrus: areas that become active when there is need to inhibit one’s own experience when considering the internal state of another and for visual evaluation of action rationality. Results support previous findings, that ToM recruits a neural network with each region sub-serving a supporting role depending on the nature of the task itself. In contrast, a network of cortical regions primarily located within right- and left-hemisphere medial-frontal and parietal cortex, outside the internal representational network, was selectively recruited during the chess task. We hypothesize that in our cohort of novice chess players the strategy was to employ an iterative thinking pattern which in part involved mentalizing processes and recruited core ToM-related regions.

Chitinase activity is increased in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the role of chitinase1 in AD is unknown. We investigated the effects of chitinase1 on Alzheimer’s pathology and microglia function. Artificial chitinase1 and chitinase inhibitor (chitinase-IN-2) were used to determine the effects of chitinase1 on inflammatory factors and β-amyloid (Aβ) oligomers deposition in D-galactose/AlCl3-induced rat model with cognitive impairments. Aβ-treated N9 microglia cells were analyzed to further verify whether the changes in inflammatory factors following chitinase1 treatment were associated with microglia alternative activation. Our data displayed that the activity of chitinase1 was both improved in D-galactose/AlCl3-injected rats and Aβ-pretreated microglia. Moreover, there was an improvement in cognitive function in chitinase1-treated AD rats. Furthermore, anti-inflammation factors (Arginase 1, Arg-1, mannose receptor type C 1, MRC1/CD206) were increased and pro-inflammation factors (tumor necrosis factor alpha, TNFα, interleukin 1 beta, IL-1β) were decreased in D-galactose/AlCl3-induced AD rats with chitinase1 treatment. A higher level of M2 markers (Arg-1, MRC1/CD206) and a lower level of classic M1 markers (TNFa, IL-1β) were obtained in Aβ-pretreated N9 cells with chitinase1, suggesting that chitinase1 polarized the microglia into an anti-AD M2 phenotype. We also detected that chitnase1 could weaken the deposition of Aβ oligomers in the brain of D-galactose/ AlCl3-induced AD rats. In conclusion, Chitinase1 might exert protective effects against AD by polarizing microglia to an M2 phenotype and resisting Aβ oligomer deposition.

Neuroinflammation is proposed to be an important component in the development of several central nervous system (CNS) disorders including depression, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and traumatic brain injury. However, exactly how neuroinflammation leads to, or contributes to, these central disorders is unclear. The objective of the study was to examine and compare the expression of mRNAs for interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-7, IL-10 and the receptors for IL-6 (IL-6R) and IL-7 (IL-7R) using in situ hybridization in discrete brain regions and in the spleen after multiple injections of 3 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a model of neuroinflammation. In the spleen, LPS significantly elevated IL-6 mRNA expression, then IL-10 mRNA, with no effect on IL-7 or IL-7R mRNA, while significantly decreasing IL-6R mRNA expression. In the CNS, LPS administration had the greatest effect on IL-6 and IL-6R mRNA. LPS increased IL-6 mRNA expression only in non-neuronal cells throughout the brain, but significantly elevated IL-6R mRNA in neuronal populations, where observed, except the cerebellum. LPS resulted in variable effects on IL-10 mRNA, and had no effect on IL-7 or IL-7R mRNA expression. These studies indicate that LPS-induced neuroinflammation has substantial but variable effects on the regional and cellular patterns of CNS IL-6, IL-7 and IL-10, and for IL-6R and IL-7R mRNA expression. It is apparent that administration of LPS can affect non-neuronal and neuronal cells in the brain. Further research is required to determine how CNS inflammatory changes associated with IL-6, IL-10 and IL-6R could in turn contribute to the development of CNS neurological disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Diabetes comes with an additional burden of moderate to severe hyperlipidemia, but little is known about the effects of lipid-lowering therapy on diabetic complications such as diabetes-associated cognitive decline. Herein we investigated the effects of statins on memory impairment and neurotoxicity in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. Our data indicated that oral administration of simvastatin at 10 or 20 mg/kg for 4 weeks significantly ameliorated diabetes-associated memory impairment reflected by performance better in the Morris water maze and Y-maze tests. The further study showed that these treatments caused significant increase of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma and decrease of NF-κB p65 in nucleus of hippocampus and cortex, and ameliorated neuroinflammatory response as evidenced by less Iba-1-positive cells and lower inflammatory mediators including IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α as well as suppressed neuronal apoptosis as indicated by decreased TUNEL-positive cells, increased ratio of Bcl-2/Bax and decreased caspase-3 activity in the hippocampus and cortex. Moreover, simvastatin pronouncedly attenuated amyloidogenesis by decreasing amyloid-β, amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta-site APP cleaving enzyme-1. As expected, treated with simvastatin, the diabetic mice exhibited significant improvement of hyperlipidemia rather than hyperglycemia. Our findings disclosed novel therapeutic potential of simvastatin for the diabetes-associated cognitive impairment.

AB  - Abstract
It is still unclear if muscle synergies reflect neural strategies or mirror the underlying mechanical constraints. Therefore, this study aimed to verify the consistency of muscle groupings between the synergies based on the linear envelope (LE) of muscle activities and those incorporating the time–frequency (TF) features of the electromyographic (EMG) signals. Twelve healthy participants performed six 20-m walking trials at a comfort and fast self-selected speed, while the activity of eleven lower limb muscles was recorded by means of surface EMG. Wavelet-transformed EMG was used to obtain the TF pattern and muscle synergies were extracted by non-negative matrix factorization. When five muscle synergies were extracted, both methods defined similar muscle groupings whatever the walking speed. When accounting the reconstruction level of the initial dataset, a new TF synergy emerged. This new synergy dissociated the activity of the rectus femoris from those of the vastii muscles (synergy #1) and from the one of the tensor fascia latae (synergy #5). Overall, extracting TF muscle synergies supports the neural origin of muscle synergies and provides an opportunity to distinguish between prescriptive and descriptive muscle synergies.

AB  - Abstract
Dopamine (DA), an important neurotransmitter and neuromodulator, plays important roles in neuronal physiological functions by activating G-protein-coupled DA D1 and/or D2 receptors. Previous studies have demonstrated that D1 receptors are functionally expressed in retinal neurons and glial cells, including ganglion cells. In this study, we explored the effects of D1 receptor activation on retinal ganglion cell (RGC) temporal summation and excitability in rat retinal slices using electrophysiological techniques. Bath application of the selective D1 receptor agonist SKF81297 increased the ratio of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) (EPSP5/EPSP1) within an EPSP train evoked by a train stimulation (five current pulses at 40 Hz), which was blocked by co-application of SCH23390, a specific D1 receptor antagonist. Ba2+, an inwardly rectifying K+ channel (Kir) blocker, significantly suppressed the SKF81297-induced effect, whereas ZD7288, a specific hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) blocker, showed a moderate inhibitory effect. The cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway, but not phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), mediated the SKF81297-induced modulation of EPSP temporal summation. Further experiments showed that SKF81297 suppressed Ba2+-sensitive Kir currents in RGCs. Additionally, SKF81297 increased the spontaneous firing frequency of RGCs, and caused depolarization of the cells with or without the presence of synaptic receptor blockers. In contrast, SKF81297 did not significantly change the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) recorded in RGCs. Our results indicate that D1 receptor activation enhances the temporal summation of RGCs mainly by suppressing Kir currents through the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway, thus increasing the excitability of rat RGCs.

AB  - Abstract
We evaluated whether a c-fos-enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) transgenic rat line, which expresses the c-fos and eGFP fusion gene, can be useful for the study of nociceptive pathways and processing. Capsaicin solution (15%) or formalin (5%) was subcutaneously injected bilaterally into the hind paws (100 μL per each paw) of adult male c-fos-eGFP transgenic or wild-type rats. Control rats were injected with ethanol or physiological saline respectively. Transgenic and wild-type rats were perfused at 1.5, 3 and 6 h post injection, with some transgenic rats being perfused 24 h post injection. A comparison of eGFP in transgenic rats and Fos-like immunoreactivity (LI) in wild-type rats was made in the dorsal spinal cord, paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON). Oxytocin-LI (OXT-LI) was carried out to examine the activation of OXT neurons in the PVN and SON. Following capsaicin or formalin treatment, eGFP was maximally expressed at 6 h in the spinal cord and 3 h in the PVN and SON, whereas, Fos-LI was maximally expressed at 1.5 h in all the regions we analyzed. Induction of eGFP in the OXT neurons was observed after capsaicin or formalin treatment, while Fos-LI in the OXT neurons was observed only after formalin treatment. These results demonstrate that the peak induction of c-fos-eGFP following exposure to acute nociceptive stimuli was delayed by around 1.5–4.5 h, but more sensitive than endogenous Fos, suggesting that the c-fos-eGFP rat line can be useful for the study of nociceptive pathways and processing.

AB  - Abstract
Cerebral ischemia leads to astrocyte’s activation and glial scar formation. Glial scar can inhibit axonal regeneration during the recovery phase. It has demonstrated that sevoflurane has neuroprotective effects against ischemic stroke, but its effects on ischemia-induced formation of astrogliosis and glial scar are unknown. This study was designed to investigate the effect of sevoflurane postconditioning on astrogliosis and glial scar formation in ischemic stroke model both in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that 2.5% of sevoflurane postconditioning could significantly reduce infarction volume and improve neurologic deficits. And it could also decrease the expression of the glial scar marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurocan and phosphacan in the peri-infarct region and markedly reduce the thickness of glial scar after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Consistent with the in vivo data, in the oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/Re) model, sevoflurane postconditioning could protect astrocyte against OGD/Re-induced injury, decrease the expression of GFAP, neurocan and phosphacan. Further studies demonstrated that sevoflurane postconditioning could down-regulate the expression of Lamp1 and active cathepsin B, and block I/R or OGD/Re-induced release of cathepsin B from the lysosomes into cytoplasm. In order to confirm whether inhibition of cathepsin B could attenuate the formation of glial scar, we used cathepsin B inhibitor CA-074Me as a positive control. The results showed that inhibition of cathepsin B could decrease the expression of GFAP, neurocan and phosphacan. Taken together, sevoflurane postconditioning can attenuate astrogliosis and glial scar formation after ischemic stroke, associating with inhibition of the activation and release of lysosomal cathepsin B.

AB  - Abstract
During the last few years, rich-club (RC) organization has been studied as a possible brain-connectivity organization model for large-scale brain networks. At the same time, empirical and simulated data of neurophysiological models have demonstrated the significant role of intra-frequency and inter-frequency coupling among distinct brain areas. The current study investigates further the importance of these couplings using recordings of resting-state magnetoencephalographic activity obtained from 30 mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) subjects and 50 healthy controls. Intra-frequency and inter-frequency coupling modes are incorporated in a single graph to detect group differences within individual rich-club subnetworks (type I networks) and networks connecting RC nodes with the rest of the nodes (type II networks). Our results show a higher probability of inter-frequency coupling for (δ–γ1), (δ–γ2), (θ–β), (θ–γ2), (α–γ2), (γ1–γ2) and intra-frequency coupling for (γ1–γ1) and (δ–δ) for both type I and type II networks in the mTBI group. Additionally, mTBI and control subjects can be correctly classified with high accuracy (98.6%), whereas a general linear regression model can effectively predict the subject group using the ratio of type I and type II coupling in the (δ, θ), (δ, β), (δ, γ1), and (δ, γ2) frequency pairs. These findings support the presence of an RC organization simultaneously with dominant frequency interactions within a single functional graph. Our results demonstrate a hyperactivation of intrinsic RC networks in mTBI subjects compared to controls, which can be seen as a plausible compensatory mechanism for alternative frequency-dependent routes of information flow in mTBI subjects.

AB  - Abstract
Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are axon growth inhibitors in the glial scar, and restrict axon regeneration following damage to the adult mammalian central nervous system. CSPGs have recently been identified as functional ligands for Nogo receptor-1 (NgR1), which is the common receptor for Nogo proteins, myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein (OMgp) and B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS). We have previously reported that through its binding to NgR1, lateral olfactory tract usher substance (LOTUS) suppresses Nogo, MAG, OMgp, and BLyS-induced axon growth inhibition. However, it remains unknown whether LOTUS also exerts this suppressive action on CSPG-induced axon growth inhibition. LOTUS overexpression rescued CSPG-induced growth cone collapse and neurite outgrowth inhibition in cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons, which only weakly express endogenous LOTUS. In cultured olfactory bulb neurons, which endogenously express LOTUS, the growth cone was insensitive to CSPG-induced collapse, but was sensitive to collapse induced by CSPGs in lotus-deficient mice. Our data demonstrate that LOTUS suppresses CSPG-induced axon growth inhibition, suggesting that LOTUS may represent a promising therapeutic agent for promoting axon regeneration.

The aim of the present study was to examine the modification of postural symmetry during quiet standing using a sensorimotor adaptation paradigm. A group of neurologically typical adult participants performed a visually guided mediolateral (left–right) weight shifting task requiring precise adjustments in body orientation. During one phase of the task, the visual feedback of center of pressure (COP) was systematically biased toward the left or the right, requiring an adjustment in posture to compensate. COP during quiet standing without visual feedback was examined prior to and immediately following the sensorimotor adaptation procedure, in order to observe whether compensatory adjustments in postural control resulting from the visual-feedback manipulation would transfer to the control of whole-body COP during quiet standing. Results showed that the sensorimotor adaptation procedure induced a small but reliable compensatory change in the stance of participants, resulting in a change in postural symmetry and control that was found to persist even after normal visual feedback was restored.

The thalamus is one of the most commonly affected brain regions in preterm infants, particularly in infants with white matter lesions (WML). The aim of this paper is to explore the development and alterations of the functional thalamocortical connectivity in preterm infants with and without punctate white matter lesions (PWMLs) during the period before term equivalent age (TEA). In this study, twenty-two normal preterm infants (NP), twenty-two preterm infants with PWMLs and thirty-one full-term control infants (FT) were enrolled. Thalamus parcellation was performed based on partial correlation between the thalamus and seven well-recognized infant networks obtained from independent component analysis (ICA), and thalamocortical connectivity was further reconstructed between the defined thalamus clusters and the whole brain. Thalamo-salience (SA) and thalamo-sensorimotor (SM) connectivity were predominantly identified, while other types of thalamocortical connectivity remained largely limited during the neonatal period. Both preterm groups exhibited prominent development in thalamo-SA and thalamo-SM connectivity during this period. Compared with NP infants, PWML infants demonstrated increased connectivity in the parietal area in thalamo-SA connectivity but no significant differences in thalamo-SM connectivity. Our results reveal that compared with NP infants, PWML infants exhibit slightly altered thalamo-SA connectivity, and this alteration is deduced to be functional compensations for inefficient thalamocortical processing due to PWMLs.

AB  - Abstract
A non-invasive, auricular percutaneous electrical nerve field stimulation (PENFS) has been suggested to modulate central pain pathways. We investigated the effects of BRIDGE® device on the responses of amygdala and lumbar spinal neurons and the development of post-colitis hyperalgesia. Male Sprague–Dawley rats received intracolonic trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) and PENFS on the same day. Control rats had sham devices. The visceromotor response (VMR) to colon distension and paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) was recorded after 7 days. A different group of rats had VMR and PWT at baseline, after TNBS and following PENFS. Extracellular recordings were made from neurons in central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) or lumbar spinal cord. Baseline firing and responses to compression of the paw were recorded before and after PENFS. Sham-treated rats exhibited a much higher VMR (&gt;30 mmHg) and lower PWT compared to PENFS-treated rats (p &lt; 0.05). PENFS decreased the VMR to colon distension and increased the PWT compared to pre-stimulation (p &lt; 0.05). PENFS resulted in a 57% decrease in spontaneous firing of the CeA neurons (0.59 ± 0.16 vs control: 1.71 ± 0.32 imp/s). Similarly, the response to somatic stimulation was decreased by 56% (3.6 ± 0.52 vs control: 1.71 ± 0.32 imps/s, p &lt; 0.05). Spinal neurons showed a 47% decrease in mean spontaneous firing (4.05 ± 0.65 vs control: 7.7 ± 0.87 imp/s) and response to somatic stimulation (7.62 ± 1.7 vs control: 14.8 ± 2.28 imp/s, p &lt; 0.05). PENFS attenuated baseline firing of CeA and spinal neurons which may account for the modulation of pain responses in this model of post-inflammatory visceral and somatic hyperalgesia.

AB  - Abstract
Activation of the serotonin type 4 (5-HT4) receptors has been reported to improve abdominal pain in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders and reduce visceral nociception in animal models. Earlier studies have proposed that 5-HT4 agonist can produce visceral analgesia by acting at the supraspinal level, but the underlying neuronal mechanisms remain unclear. The caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM) is the first site for processing of visceral nociceptive signals ascending via spinal pathways and an important component of the endogenous pain modulatory system. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to examine whether activation of 5-HT4 receptors can affect the visceral pain-related neurons in the CVLM. In urethane-anesthetized adult male Wistar rats, we evaluated the effects of a 5-HT4 receptor agonist, BIMU8 on ongoing firing of the CVLM neurons and their excitatory responses to noxious colorectal distension (CRD, 80 mmHg). The drug’s effect was also tested on blood pressure reactions induced by CRD–a general physiological measure of visceral nociception. Intravenous administration of BIMU8 (0.5, 1 or 2 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent suppression of both the ongoing and CRD-evoked activities of the CVLM neurons and simultaneously attenuated the depressor hemodynamic reaction to CRD. The compound’s inhibitory effect was almost completely eliminated by intracerebroventricular pretreatment with GR113808, a selective 5-HT4 antagonist, indicating the preferential involvement of supraspinal 5-HT4 receptors. Results indicate that visceral nociceptive transmission through the caudal medulla is negatively modulated by descending 5-HT4-dependent mechanisms. These findings can contribute to a deeper understanding of supraspinal processing of pain signals from the abdomen.

AB  - Abstract
Deep hypothermia therapy (HT) is a standard method for neuroprotection during complex pediatric cardiac surgery involving extracorporeal circulation and deep hypothermic cardiac arrest. The procedure, however, can provoke systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), one of the most severe side effects associated with pediatric cardiac surgery. To date, the cellular inflammatory mechanisms induced by deep HT remain to be elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the effects of deep HT (17 °C) and rewarming on the inflammatory response in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated BV-2 murine microglia. Additionally, we also investigated the application of Stattic, a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation inhibitor, as an alternative to physical cooling to attenuate the LPS-induced inflammatory response.

Deep HT had no cytotoxic effect but attenuated microglia migration. IκBα degradation was delayed by deep HT resulting in the attenuation of pNF-κB p65 migration into the nucleus and significant decreases in pro-inflammatory IL-6, TNF-α, and MCP-1 expressions and secretions, as well as decreased anti-inflammatory IL-10 and SOCS3 expressions. Additionally, pStat3 was significantly down regulated under deep hypothermic conditions, also corresponding with the significant reduction in IL-6 and TNF-α expressions. Similar to the effects of HT, the application of Stattic under normothermic conditions resulted in significantly reduced IL-6 and TNF-α expressions. Moreover, attenuation of the inflammatory response resulted in decreased apoptosis in a direct co-culture of microglia and neurons.

HT reduces the inflammatory response in LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells, alluding to a possible mechanism of therapeutic hypothermia-induced neuroprotection. In the future, attenuating the phospho-STAT3 pathway may lead to the development of a neuroprotectant with greater clinical efficacy.

Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurological conditions worldwide. The current poor understanding and lack of reliable biomarkers of the epileptogenic process are the major limitations in the development of anti-epileptic drugs that are able to prevent or modify the underlying disease. The rapid progress in advanced imaging technologies has expanded our opportunities to study the disease in animal models of epilepsy by means of non-invasive research tools.

Here we review the advances of different in vivo imaging techniques, including magnetic resonance-based and nuclear imaging-based modalities, in animal models of epilepsy. Together these techniques can be applied to visualize and quantify structural, metabolic, functional and molecular changes in longitudinal study designs to provide unique information about early pathophysiological changes and their interplay involved in epileptogenesis, monitoring the disease progression, assessing the effectiveness of possible therapies, and potentially identify translatable biomarkers for clinical use.

AB  - Abstract
The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-contacting nucleus is implicated in the descending inhibitory pathway in pain processing, whereas the cellular and molecular mechanisms underpinning CSF-contacting nucleus regulating pain signals remains largely elusive. ATP is evidenced to inhibit pain transmission at supraspinal level by the mediation of the receptor P2X, wherein its subtype P2X3 is identified as the most potent. Our present experiment investigated the functionality of P2X3 receptors in CSF-contacting nucleus in the formalin-evoked inflammatory pain. Immunofluorescence and western blot revealed the expression of P2X3 receptors in the CSF-contacting nucleus and their upregulated expression subsequent to administration of formalin in rat model. ATP (a P2X3 receptor agonist, 100 nmol/5 µl) by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration ameliorated pain behaviors and enhanced c-Fos immunoreactivity in the neurons of the periaqueductal gray (PAG), both of which were discounted by pre-administration of A-317491 (a selective P2X3 receptor antagonist, 25 nmol/5 µl). After the CSF-contacting nucleus was ablated by cholera toxin subunit B-saporin, ATP failed to induce analgesia, with the c-Fos immunoreactivity in the PAG neurons remaining intact. Our results validated that P2X3 receptors in the CSF-contacting nucleus are pivotal in inflammatory pain processing via the activation of PAG neurons.

AB  - Abstract
An intriguing feature of nervous system development in most animal species is that the initial number of generated neurons is higher than the number of neurons incorporated into mature circuits. A substantial portion of neurons is indeed eliminated via apoptosis during a short time window – in rodents the first two postnatal weeks. While it is well established that neurotrophic factors play a central role in controlling neuronal survival and apoptosis in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), the situation is less clear in the central nervous system (CNS). In postnatal rodent neocortex, the peak of apoptosis coincides with the occurrence of spontaneous, synchronous activity patterns. In this article, we review recent results that demonstrate the important role of electrical activity for neuronal survival in the neocortex, describe the role of Ca2+ and neurotrophic factors in translating electrical activity into pro-survival signals, and finally discuss the clinical impact of the tight relation between electrical activity and neuronal survival versus apoptosis.

AB  - Abstract
Several brain structures including the brainstem, the cerebellum and the frontal cortico-basal ganglia network, with the primary and premotor areas have been shown to participate in the functional organization of gait initiation and postural control in humans, but their respective roles remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to better understand the role of the supplementary motor area (SMA) and posterior cerebellum in the gait initiation process. Gait initiation parameters were recorded in 22 controls both before and after continuous theta burst transcranial stimulation (cTBS) of the SMA and cerebellum, and were compared to sham stimulation, using a randomized double-blind design study. The two phases of gait initiation process were analyzed: anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) and execution, with recordings of soleus and tibialis anterior muscles. Functional inhibition of the SMA led to a shortened APA phase duration with advanced and increased muscle activity; during execution, it also advanced muscle co-activation and decreased the duration of stance soleus activity. Cerebellar functional inhibition did not influence the APA phase duration and amplitude but increased muscle co-activation, it decreased execution duration and showed a trend to increase velocity, with increased swing soleus muscle duration and activity. The results suggest that the SMA contributes to both the timing and amplitude of the APAs with no influence on step execution and the posterior cerebellum in the coupling between the APAs and execution phases and leg muscle activity pattern during gait initiation.

AB  - Abstract
Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are pathological pain-associated voltage-gated ion channels. They are widely expressed in central nervous system including spinal lamina II (also named the substantia gelatinosa, SG). Here, we examined the distribution of HCN channels in glutamatergic synaptic terminals as well as their role in the modulation of synaptic transmission in SG neurons from SD rats and glutamic acid decarboxylase-67 (GAD67)-GFP mice. We found that the expression of the HCN channel isoforms was varied in SG. The HCN4 isoform showed the highest level of co-localization with VGLUT2 (23 ± 3%). In 53% (n = 21/40 neurons) of the SG neurons examined in SD rats, application of HCN channel blocker, ZD7288 (10 μM), decreased the frequency of spontaneous (s) and miniature (m) excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) by 37 ± 4% and 33 ± 4%, respectively. Consistently, forskolin (FSK) (an activator of adenylate cyclase) significantly increased the frequency of mEPSCs by 225 ± 34%, which could be partially inhibited by ZD7288. Interestingly, the effects of ZD7288 and FSK on sEPSC frequency were replicated in non-GFP-expressing neurons, but not in GFP-expressing GABAergic SG neurons, in GAD67-GFP transgenic C57/BL6 mice. In summary, our results represent a previously unknown cellular mechanism by which presynaptic HCN channels, especially HCN4, regulate the glutamate release from presynaptic terminals that target excitatory, but not inhibitory SG interneurons.

AB  - Abstract
Heat Stress (HS) induces diverse pathophysiological changes, which include brain ischemia, oxidative stress and neuronal damage. The present study was undertaken with the objective to ascertain whether neuroinflammation in Hypothalamus (HTH) caused under HS affects monoamine levels and hence, its physiological role in thermoregulation. Rats were exposed to HS in a heat simulation environmental chamber (Ambient temperature, Ta = 45 ± 0.5 °C and Relative Humidity, RH = 30 ± 10%) with real-time measurement of core temperature (Tc) and skin temperature (Ts). Animals were divided into two subgroups: Moderate HS (MHS) (Tc = 40 °C) and Severe HS (SHS)/Heat stroke (Tc = 42 °C). Rats with MHS showed an increase in Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) and Heart Rate (HR) while fall in MAP and rise in HR was observed in rats with SHS. In addition, oxidative stress and an increase in pyknotic neurons were observed in HTH. High levels of Adrenocorticotropic-hormone (ACTH), Epinephrine (EPI), Norepinephrine (NE) and Dopamine (DA) in the systemic circulation and progressive increase in EPI and DA levels in HTH were recorded after the thermal insult. Moreover, a substantial increase in Glutamate (Glu) level was observed in HTH as well as in systemic circulation of heat stroke rats. We found a rise in NE whereas a fall in Serotonin (5-HT) level in HTH at MHS, without perturbing inflammatory mediators. However, rats with SHS exhibited significant elevations in NF-kB, IL-1β, COX2, GFAP and Iba1 protein expression in HTH. In conclusion, the data suggest that SHS induces neuroinflammation in HTH, which is associated with monoamines and Glu imbalances, leading to thermoregulatory disruption.

AB  - Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the formation of Lewy bodies (LBs) in dopaminergic neurons. α-Synuclein (α-syn), a major protein component of LBs, is known to regulate synaptic plasticity, with a crucial role in memory and motor function in the central nervous system. Levodopa (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine; also known as L-DOPA) is considered the most effective medication for controlling the symptoms of PD. However, it is unclear whether L-DOPA improves the neuropathology of PD. In the present study, we investigated the effect of L-DOPA on SH-SY5Y neuronal cells under α-syn-induced toxicity. We assessed the protein and mRNA levels of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and cell death markers using western blot analysis and reverse transcription–PCR. Our data showed that L-DOPA could attenuate ER stress markers, including the levels of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), C/EBP homologous protein expression (CHOP), immunoglobulin-heavy-chain-binding protein (BiP), sliced X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP-1), and reduce nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling through dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) in SH-SY5Y neuronal cells under α-syn-induced toxicity. In conclusion, we suggest that L-DOPA may attenuate the neuropathology of PD by regulating signaling related to DRD2 in neuronal cells under α-syn-induced toxicity. Our study, therefore, indicates an additional role for L-DOPA in the treatment of PD.

AB  - Abstract
Previous studies have shown that Event-related potentials (ERPs) are sensitive to violations of gender-based stereotypes. In the present investigation, we used ERPs to measure the detection of a discrepancy between gender-based occupational stereotypes and written material presented to fifteen Italian viewers in a completely implicit task. No awareness or judgment about stereotypes was required, no decision had to be made on sentence acceptability or congruence, and no prime words related to gender were presented (which might reveal the matter of the investigation). EEG was recorded while participants engaged in a task that consisted of pressing a key in response to animal words, while ignoring the overall study’s purpose. Two hundred forty sentences that did or did not violate gender stereotypes were presented randomly with 32 other sentences ending with an animal word. Terminal words violating gender stereotypes (such as “The notary is BREASTFEEDING” or “Here is the commissioner with HER HUSBAND”) elicited a greater anterior N400 response and left anterior negativity (LAN) than words conforming to the gender stereotype (e.g., “The chemist put on a nice TIE”). LAN modulation suggests that gender stereotypes are processed automatically (as if they were morpho-syntactic errors) and hints at how they are deeply rooted in our linguistic brain. According to the inverse solution, the neural representation of gender-based stereotypes mostly involved the middle frontal gyrus (MFG). The temporo/parietal junction (TPJ) supporting theory of mind (TOM) processes was also engaged, along with the superior and middle temporal gyri representing person information.

AB  - Abstract
To study the development of orthographic sensitivity during elementary school, we recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) from 2nd and 4th grade children who were exposed to line drawing of object or animals upon which the correctly or incorrectly spelled name was superimposed. Stimulus-locked ERPs showed a modulation of a frontocentral negativity between 200 and 500 ms which was larger for the 4th grade children but did not show an effect of correctness of spelling. This effect was followed by a pronounced positive shift which was only seen in the 4th grade children and which showed a modulation of spelling correctness. This effect can be seen as an electrophysiological correlate of orthographic sensitivity and replicates earlier findings in adults. Moreover, response-locked ERPs triggered to the children’s button presses indicating orthographic (in)-correctness showed a succession of waves including the frontocentral error-related negativity and a subsequent negativity with a more posterior distribution. This latter negativity was generally larger for the 4th grade children. Only for the 4th grade children, this negativity was smaller for the false alarm trials suggesting a conscious registration of the error in these children.

AB  - Abstract
Muscle pain is an important health issue and frequently related to static force exertion. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether peripheral inflammatory mechanisms are involved with static contraction-induced muscle pain in rats. To this end, we developed a model of muscle pain induced by static contraction performed by applying electrical pulses through electrodes inserted into muscle. We also evaluated the involvement of neutrophil migration, bradykinin, sympathetic amines and prostanoids. A single session of sustained static contraction of gastrocnemius muscle induced acute mechanical muscle hyperalgesia without affecting locomotor activity and with no evidence of structural damage in muscle tissue. Static contraction increased levels of creatine kinase but not lactate dehydrogenase, and induced neutrophil migration. Dexamethasone (glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory agent), DALBK (bradykinin B1 antagonist), Atenolol (β1 adrenoceptor antagonist), ICI 118,551 (β2 adrenoceptor antagonist), indomethacin (cyclooxygenase inhibitor), and fucoidan (non-specific selectin inhibitor) all reduced static contraction-induced muscle hyperalgesia; however, the bradykinin B2 antagonist, bradyzide, did not have an effect on static contraction-induced muscle hyperalgesia. Furthermore, an increased hyperalgesic response was observed when the selective bradykinin B1 agonist des-Arg9-bradykinin was injected into the previously stimulated muscle. Together, these findings demonstrate that static contraction induced mechanical muscle hyperalgesia in gastrocnemius muscle of rats is modulated through peripheral inflammatory mechanisms that are dependent on neutrophil migration, bradykinin, sympathetic amines and prostanoids. Considering the clinical relevance of muscle pain, we propose the present model of static contraction-induced mechanical muscle hyperalgesia as a useful tool for the study of mechanisms underlying static contraction-induced muscle pain.

AB  - Abstract
Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurological disorder characterized by motor and cognitive impairment, autonomic dysfunction and a loss of purposeful hand skills. In the majority of cases, typical RTT is caused by de novo mutations in the X-linked gene, MECP2. Alterations in the structure and function of neurons within the central nervous system of RTT patients and Mecp2-null mouse models are well established. In contrast, few studies have investigated the effects of MeCP2-deficiency on peripheral nerves. In this study, we conducted detailed morphometric as well as functional analysis of the sciatic nerves of symptomatic adult female Mecp2+/− mice. We observed a significant reduction in the mean diameter of myelinated nerve fibers in Mecp2+/− mice. In myelinated fibers, mitochondrial densities per unit area of axoplasm were significantly altered in Mecp2+/− mice. However, conduction properties of the sciatic nerve of Mecp2 knockout mice were not different from control. These subtle changes in myelinated peripheral nerve fibers in heterozygous Mecp2 knockout mice could potentially explain some RTT phenotypes.

AB  - Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of memory. The neurodegeneration induced by AD has been linked to oxidative damage. However, little is known about the involvement of NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2), a multisubunit enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species, in the pathogenesis of AD. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the involvement of Nox2 in memory, in AD-related brain abnormalities, oxidative damage, inflammation and neuronal death in the hippocampus in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced AD-like state by comparing the effects of that drug on mice lacking gp91phox−/− and wild-type (Wt) mice. Nox2 gene expression was found increased in Wt mice after STZ injection. In object recognition test, Wt mice injected with STZ presented impairment in short- and long-term memory, which was not observed following Nox2 deletion. STZ treatment induced increased phosphorylation of Tau and increased amyloid-β, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and astrocyte and microglial markers expression in Wt mice but not in gp91phox−/−. STZ treatment increased oxidative damage and pro-inflammatory cytokines’ release in Wt mice, which was not observed in gp91phox−/− mice. Nox2 deletion had a positive effect on the IL-10 baseline production, suggesting that this cytokine might contribute to the neuroprotection mechanism against STZ-induced neurodegeneration. In summary, our data suggest that the Nox2-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation contributes to the STZ-induced AD-like state.

Recent evidence suggests that ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in an organ may have distance effect on the brain. In this study, the effects of renal I/R, limb I/R or both together on the structural and function of hippocampus were evaluated and compared. Hence, rats were subjected to 2-h bilateral lower limb ischemia, 45-min bilateral renal ischemia, or combined limb and renal ischemia followed by 1-day reperfusion. At 22-h reperfusion, each rat was fixed on a stereotaxic apparatus for performing electrophysiological study on the hippocampus. The long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced by high-frequency stimulation (HFS), and paired-pulse ratio (PPR) was also monitored before and after HFS delivery. After taking blood sample and sacrificing animal, its brain was removed and preserved for stereological study. The limb I/R reduced plasma osmolality that led to synaptic excitement in the hippocampus, where there was a considerable loss of pyramidal cells and markedly impaired short- and long-term synaptic plasticity. The renal I/R largely increased plasma creatinine that might excite basal synaptic transmission. In the rats with combined limb and renal I/R, the hippocampal neuronal loss and impaired synaptic plasticity were the same as those with limb I/R, but basal synaptic transmission was lowered. In conclusion, the 2-h lower limb ischemia compared to 45-min renal ischemia induced more injurious distant effects on the hippocampus after 1-day reperfusion. The combination of renal and limb I/R did not add or potentiate hippocampal neuronal loss and synaptic plasticity impairment, whereas it decreased the basal synaptic transmission with respect to each one alone.

AB  - Abstract
The periodontal ligament (PDL) includes several types of nerve endings, such as Aβ-, Aδ-, and C-fibers, which play critical roles in detecting the strength and direction of occlusal force. Previous studies have demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the PDL activates the somatosensory and insular cortices. However, the profile of cortical excitation in response to mechanical PDL stimulation mostly remains unknown. To investigate the differences in cortical responses to electrical and mechanical stimulation of the maxillary first molar, we performed optical imaging to determine the responding cortical regions in combination with a pharmacological approach. The molar was mechanically stimulated by pulling in the rostral direction, and electrical stimulation was applied via bipolar electrodes inserted into the mesial PDL. Mechanical stimulation initially excited the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), whereas electrical stimulation evoked an initial response between the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and insular oral region (IOR). The characteristic feature responding to mechanical stimulation was the rebound response evoked at the end of mechanical stimulation. A longer mechanical stimulation evoked a larger amplitude of the rebound response. A paired-pulse protocol of mechanical stimulation revealed that the amplitude of the second response was smaller than the first response, in accordance with the shorter interstimulus interval. Systemic application of morphine, a potent blocker of nociception, reduced the amplitude of the maximum excitation, particularly in S2/IOR compared to S1. These results suggest that S1 and S2/IOR are principally excited by mechanical and electrical stimulation, respectively, and that S2/IOR is involved in nociception processing.

AB  - Abstract
The current decerebration procedures discard the role of the thalamus in the motor control and decortication only rules out the brain cortex part, leaving a gap between the brain cortex and the subthalamic motor regions. In here we define a new preparation denominated Brain Cortex-Ablated Cat (BCAC), in which the frontal and parietal brain cortices as well as the central white matter beneath them were removed, this decerebration process may be considered as suprathalamic, since the thalamus remained intact. To characterize this preparation cat hindlimb electromyograms (EMG), kinematics and cutaneous reflexes (CR) produced by electrical stimulation of sural (SU) or saphenous (SAPH) nerves were analyzed during locomotion in intact and in BCAC. In cortex-ablated cats compared to intact cats, the hindlimb EMG amplitude was increased in the flexors, whereas in most extensors the amplitude was decreased. Bifunctional muscle EMGs presented complex and speed-dependent amplitude changes. In intact cats CR produced an inhibition of extensors, as well as excitation and inhibition of flexors, and a complex pattern of withdrawal responses in bifunctional muscles. The same stimuli applied to BCAC produced no detectable responses, but in some cats cutaneous reflexes produced by electrical stimulation of saphenous nerve reappeared when the locomotion speed increased. In BCAC, EMG and kinematic changes, as well as the absence of CR, imply that for this cat preparation there is a partial compensation due to the subcortical locomotor apparatus generating close to normal locomotion.

AB  - Abstract
The NMDA receptor (NMDAr) hypofunction theory of schizophrenia suggests that aberrant signaling through NMDAr underlies the pathophysiology of this disease. This is commonly modeled in rodents via treatment with NMDAr antagonists, which causes a range of behavioral effects that represent endophenotypes related to schizophrenia. These drugs also disrupt high-frequency neural oscillations within the brain, also potentially relevant to disease. We studied the effect of localized NMDAr hypofunction on the generation of neural oscillations occurring both locally and in distant brain regions, and on behaviors routinely used as endophenotypes to model psychosis in rodents. Wistar rats were implanted with local field potential recording electrodes in the prefrontal cortex, dorsal hippocampus and nucleus accumbens, as well as cannulae in these regions to facilitate drug infusion. Rats received bilateral infusions of MK801 (0, 5 μg, 20 μg, 50 μg) into one of the three target regions and their behavior measured in an open field. We also assessed the effects of systemic MK801 injection (0.16 mg/kg sc). Electrophysiological signals were recorded continuously, allowing assessment of gamma oscillations (30–80 Hz) and high-frequency oscillations (HFO: 130–180 Hz) occurring as a result of infusions. Regardless of MK801 infusion location, gamma oscillations and HFOs significantly and consistently increased in all three regions studied, similar to that observed following systemic injection. Locomotor activity, stereotypies and ataxia were also observed following infusion into all regions. We conclude that localized regions exhibiting NMDAr hypofunction are sufficient to disrupt local as well as diffuse neural circuits and global brain function, and concomitantly cause psychosis-related behavioral effects.

AB  - Abstract
Phox2b encodes a paired-like homeodomain-containing transcription factor essential for development of the autonomic nervous system. Phox2b-expressing (Phox2b+) neurons are present in the reticular formation dorsal to the trigeminal motor nucleus (RdV) as well as the nucleus of the solitary tract and parafacial respiratory group. However, the nature of Phox2b+ RdV neurons is still unclear. We investigated the physiological and morphological properties of Phox2b+ RdV neurons using postnatal day 2–7 transgenic rats expressing yellow fluorescent protein under the control of Phox2b. Almost all of Phox2b+ RdV neurons were glutamatergic, whereas Phox2b-negative (Phox2b−) RdV neurons consisted of a few glutamatergic, many GABAergic, and many glycinergic neurons. The majority (48/56) of Phox2b+ neurons showed low-frequency firing (LF), while most of Phox2b− neurons (35/42) exhibited high-frequency firing (HF) in response to intracellularly injected currents. All, but one, Phox2b+ neurons (55/56) did not fire spontaneously, whereas three-fourths of the Phox2b− neurons (31/42) were spontaneously active. K+ channel and persistent Na+ current blockers affected the firing of LF and HF neurons. The majority of Phox2b+ (35/46) and half of the Phox2b− neurons (19/40) did not respond to stimulations of the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus, the trigeminal tract, and the principal sensory trigeminal nucleus. Biocytin labeling revealed that about half of the Phox2b+ (5/12) and Phox2b− RdV neurons (5/10) send their axons to the trigeminal motor nucleus. These results suggest that Phox2b+ RdV neurons have distinct neurotransmitter phenotypes and firing properties from Phox2b− RdV neurons and might play important roles in feeding-related functions including suckling and possibly mastication.

AB  - Abstract
The vast majority of functional studies investigating mirror neurons (MNs) explored their properties in relation to hand actions, and very few investigated how MNs respond to mouth actions or communicative gestures. Since hand and mouth MNs were recorded in two partially overlapping sectors of the ventral precentral cortex of the macaque monkey, there is a general assumption that they share a same neuroanatomical network, with the parietal cortex as a main source of visual information. In the current review, we challenge this perspective and describe the connectivity pattern of mouth MN sector. The mouth MNs F5/opercular region is connected with premotor, parietal areas mostly related to the somatosensory and motor representation of the face/mouth, and with area PrCO, involved in processing gustatory and somatosensory intraoral input. Unlike hand MNs, mouth MNs do not receive their visual input from parietal regions. Such information related to face/communicative behaviors could come from the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Further strong connections derive from limbic structures involved in encoding emotional facial expressions and motivational/reward processing. These brain structures include the anterior cingulate cortex, the anterior and mid-dorsal insula, orbitofrontal cortex and the basolateral amygdala. The mirror mechanism is therefore composed and supported by at least two different anatomical pathways: one is concerned with sensorimotor transformation in relation to reaching and hand grasping within the traditional parietal-premotor circuits; the second one is linked to the mouth/face motor control and is connected with limbic structures, involved in communication/emotions and reward processing.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic musculoskeletal pain is one of the main symptoms found in Fibromyalgia with unclear etiology and limited pharmacological treatment. The aim of this study was to complex LIM in β-cyclodextrin (LIM-βCD) and then evaluate its antihyperalgesic effect in an animal model of chronic musculoskeletal pain. Differential scanning calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy was used for the characterization of the inclusion complex. Male Swiss mice were used for experimental procedures where mechanical hyperalgesia, thermal hyperalgesia, muscular strength, Fos immunofluorescence was studied after induction of hyperalgesia. Mechanism of action was also investigated through tail flick test and capsaicin-induced nociception. Endothermic events and morphological changes showed that the slurry complex method was the best method for the complexation. After induction of hyperalgesia, the oral administration of LIM-βCD (50 mg/kg) significantly increased the paw withdrawal threshold compared to uncomplexed limonene. Fos immunofluorescence showed that both compounds significantly decreased the number of Fos-positive cells in the dorsal horn. In nociceptive tests, FLU was able to reverse the antinociceptive effect of LIM-βCD. After intraplantar administration of capsaicin, LIM was able to significantly decrease time to lick. LIM-βCD has antihyperalgesic action superior to its uncomplexed form, with possible action in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. These results suggest the possible applicability of LIM, uncomplexed or complexed with βCD, in conditions such as FM and neuropathic pain, for which there are currently only limited pharmacological options.

AB  - Abstract
We investigated role of capsaicin-sensitive afferents within and without the areas of Zusanli (ST36)/Shangjuxu (ST37) acupoints along the stomach (ST) meridian in the perception and modulation of pain assessed by visual analog scale of pain and its distribution rated by subjects, pressure pain threshold (PPT), and heat pain threshold (HPT) in humans. Compared with the treatment of non-acupoint area, capsaicin (100 µg/50 µl) administered into either ST36 or ST37 acupoint caused the strongest pain intensity and the most extensive pain distribution, followed by rapid onset, bilateral, long-lasting secondary mechanical hyperalgesia and slower onset secondary heat hypoalgesia (1 day after the capsaicin treatment). Between treatments of different acupoints, capsaicin administrated into the ST36 acupoint exhibited the stronger pain intensity and more widespread pain distribution compared with the treatment of ST37 acupoint. A period of 30- to 45-min, but not 15-min, 43 °C heating-needle stimulation applied to the ST36 acupoint significantly enhanced the HPT, and had no effect on PPT. Upon trapezius muscle pain elicited by the i.m. injection of 5.8% saline, pre-emptive treatment of the contralateral ST36 acupoint with 43 °C heating-needle stimulation alleviated the ongoing muscle pain, reduced painful area, and reversed the decrease in HPT. It is suggested that (1) pain elicited from the acupoint and non-acupoint areas differs significantly, which are supposed to be dependent on the different distributions and contributions of capsaicin-sensitive afferents. (2) Non-painful heat stimulation is a valid approach in prevention of ongoing muscle pain with associated post-effects of peripheral and central sensitization.

AB  - Abstract
The application of subsensory noise stimulation over the lower limbs has been shown to improve proprioception and postural control under certain conditions. Whereas the effect specificity seems to depend on several factors, studies are still needed to determine the appropriate method for training and rehabilitation purposes. In the current study, we investigated whether the application of subsensory electrical noise over the legs improves proprioceptive function in young and older adults. We aimed to provide evidence that stronger and age-related differential effects occur in more demanding tasks. Proprioceptive function was initially assessed by testing the detection of passive ankle movement (kinesthetic perception) in twenty-eight subjects (14 young and 14 older adults). Thereafter, postural control was assessed during tasks with different sensory challenges: i) by removing visual information (eyes closed) and; ii) by moving the visual scene (moving room paradigm). Tests performed with the application of electrical noise stimulation were compared to those performed without noise. The results showed that electrical noise applied over the legs led to a reduction in the response time to kinesthetic perception in both young and older adults. On the other hand, the magnitude of postural sway was reduced by noise stimulation only during a more challenging task, namely, when the optical flow was changing in an unpredictable (nonperiodic) manner. No differential effects of stimulation between groups were observed. These findings suggest that the relevance of proprioceptive inputs in tasks with different challenges, but not the subjects’ age, is a determining factor for sensorimotor improvements due to electrical noise stimulation.

AB  - Abstract
Cholecystokinin (CCK)-expressing neurons within the nucleus of the solitary tract (CCKNTS) of the mouse are responsive to satiety signals and their chemogenetic activation suppresses appetite. Optogenetic activation of CCKNTS axon terminals within either the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) or the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) is sufficient to suppress feeding. An interesting dichotomy has been revealed when assessing the motivational valence of these two circuits. Activating CCKNTS cell bodies is aversive as demonstrated by conditioned taste aversion and place-preference assays. Activation of the CCKNTS → PBN pathway is also aversive; however, stimulating the CCKNTS → PVH pathway is appetitive when assayed using a real-time, place-preference task. Thus, these two projections from CCKNTS neurons reduce food intake through opposite motivational states; one pathway signals positive valence (CCKNTS → PVH) and the other signals negative valence (CCKNTS → PBN).

AB  - Abstract
The antinociceptive action of botulinum toxin type A (BoNT/A) has been demonstrated in behavioral animal studies and clinical settings. It was shown that this effect is associated with toxin activity in CNS, however, the mechanism is not fully understood. Substance P (SP) is one of the dominant neurotransmitters in primary afferent neurons transmitting pain and itch. Thus, here we examined association of SP-mediated transmission and BoNT/A antinociceptive action by employing gene knockouts.

Antinociceptive activity of intraplantarly (i.pl.) injected BoNT/A was examined in mice lacking the gene encoding for SP/neurokinin A (tac1−/−) or SP-preferred receptor neurokinin 1 (tac1r−/−), compared to control C57Bl/6 J wild type animals. BoNT/A action was assessed in inflammatory pain induced by formalin and CFA, and neuropathic pain induced by partial sciatic nerve ligation. BoNT/A activity in CNS was examined by c-Fos and BoNT/A-cleaved SNAP-25 immunohistochemistry.

In wild type mice, acute (formalin-evoked) and chronic pain (neuropathic and inflammatory) was reduced by peripherally injected BoNT/A. In tac1−/− and tac1r−/− knockout mice, BoNT/A exerted no analgesic effect. In control animals BoNT/A reduced the formalin-evoked c-Fos expression in lumbar dorsal horn, while in knockout mice the c-Fos expression was not reduced. After peripheral toxin injection, cleaved SNAP-25 occurred in lumbar dorsal horn in all animal genotypes.

BoNT/A antinociceptive activity is absent in animals lacking the SP and neurokinin 1 receptor encoding genes, in spite of presence of toxin’s enzymatic activity in central sensory regions. Thus, we conclude that the integrity of SP-ergic system is necessary for the antinociceptive activity of BoNT/A.

AB  - Abstract
GPR37 is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor that is predominantly expressed in the brain and found at particularly high levels in oligodendrocytes. GPR37 has been shown to exert effects on oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination during development, but the molecular basis of these actions is incompletely understood and moreover nothing is known about the potential role(s) of this receptor under demyelinating conditions. To shed light on the fundamental biology of GPR37, we performed proteomic studies comparing protein expression levels in the brains of mice lacking GPR37 and its close relative GPR37-like 1 (GPR37L1). These studies revealed that one of the proteins most sharply decreased in the brains of Gpr37/Gpr37L1 double knockout mice is the myelin-associated glycoprotein MAG. Follow-up Western blot studies confirmed this finding and demonstrated that genetic deletion of Gpr37, but not Gpr37L1, results in strikingly decreased brain expression of MAG. Further in vitro studies demonstrated that GPR37 and MAG form a complex when expressed together in cells. As loss of MAG has previously been shown to result in increased susceptibility to brain insults, we additionally assessed Gpr37-knockout (Gpr37−/−) vs. wild-type mice in the cuprizone model of demyelination. These studies revealed that Gpr37−/− mice exhibit dramatically increased loss of myelin in response to cuprizone, yet do not show any increased loss of oligodendrocyte precursor cells or mature oligodendrocytes. These findings reveal that loss of GPR37 alters oligodendrocyte physiology and increases susceptibility to demyelination, indicating that GPR37 could be a potential drug target for the treatment of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.

AB  - Abstract
Numerous experimental and clinical studies have suggested that the interaction between the immune system and the brain plays an important role in the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The NLRP3 inflammasome is an important part of the innate immune system. This complex regulates proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) maturation, which triggers different kinds of immune-inflammatory reactions. We employed repeated forced swims to establish a model of CFS in mice. NLRP3 knockout (KO) mice were also used to explore NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the mechanisms of CFS, using the same treatment. After completing repeated swim tests, the mice displayed fatigue-like behaviors, including locomotor activity and reduced fall-off time on the rota-rod test, which was accompanied by significantly higher mature IL-1β level in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) level in serum. We also found increased NLRP3 protein expression, NLRP3 inflammasome formation and increased mature IL-1β production in the PFC, relative to untreated mice. The NLRP3 KO mice displayed significantly moderated fatigue behaviors along with decreased PFC and serum IL-1β levels under the same treatment. These findings demonstrated the involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the mechanism of swimming-induced fatigue. Future therapies targeting the NLRP3/IL-1β pathway may have significant potential for fatigue prevention and treatment.

AB  - Abstract
The insular cortex is a critical brain region involved in nicotine addiction. However, its specific cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying nicotine addiction remains largely unknown. In the present study, we examined how nicotine modulates synaptic transmission and plasticity in layer V pyramidal neurons of the mouse insular cortex. We also examined which type of neurons express functional nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in layer V of the insular cortex. We found that nicotine suppresses synaptic potentiation induced by combination of presynaptic stimulation with postsynaptic depolarization (paired training). An application of nicotine significantly enhanced both spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs): the former effect was mediated by activation of β2-containing nAChRs while the latter one was mediated largely by activation of β2-containing nAChRs and to a minor extent by activation of α7-containing nAChRs. The application of nicotine significantly enhanced evoked IPSCs but had no effect on evoked EPSCs. We also found that in layer V of the mouse insular cortex, majority of non-fast-spiking (non-FS) interneurons have β2-containing nAChRs while about half of pyramidal neurons and FS interneurons have functional nAChRs. Blockade of GABAA receptors or β2-containing nAChRs prevented the effects of nicotine on synaptic potentiation. Taken together, these results suggest that in layer V pyramidal neurons of the insular cortex, activation of β2-containing nAChRs expressed in non-FS interneurons suppresses synaptic potentiation through enhancing GABAergic synaptic transmission. These findings provide important insights into the cellular and synaptic mechanisms of insular cortical changes in nicotine addiction.

AB  - Abstract
Previous studies have shown that aging modifies taste sensitivity. However, the factors affecting the changes in taste sensitivity remain unclear. To investigate the cause of the age-related changes in taste sensitivity, we compared the peripheral taste detection systems in young and old mice. First, we examined whether taste sensitivity varied according to age using behavioral assays. We confirmed that the taste sensitivities to salty and bitter tastes decreased with aging. In other assays, the gustatory nerve responses to salty and sweet tastes increased significantly with aging, while those to bitter taste did not change. Thus, the profile of the gustatory nerve responses was inconsistent with the profile of the behavioral responses. Next, we evaluated the expressions of taste-related molecules in the taste buds. Although no apparent differences in the expressions of representative taste receptors were observed between the two age groups, the mRNA expressions of signaling effectors were slightly, but significantly, decreased in old mice. No significant differences in the turnover rates of taste bud cells were observed between the two age groups. Thus, we did not observe any large decreases in the expressions of taste-related molecules and turnover rates of taste bud cells with aging. Based on these findings, we conclude that changes in taste sensitivity with aging were not caused by aging-related degradation of peripheral taste organs. Meanwhile, the concentrations of several serum components that modify taste responses changed with age. Thus, taste signal-modifying factors such as serum components may have a contributing role in aging-related changes in taste sensitivity.

AB  - Abstract
Sinomenium acutum has been used in traditional medicine to treat a painful disease such as rheumatic arthritis and neuralgia. Sinomenine, which is a main bioactive ingredient in Sinomenium acutum, has been reported to have an analgesic effect in diverse pain animal models. However little is known about the detailed mechanisms underlying peripheral analgesic effect of sinomenine. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate its cellular mechanism by using formalin-induced acute inflammatory pain model in mice. We found that intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of sinomenine (50 mg/kg) suppressed formalin-induced paw licking behavior in both the first and the second phase. Formalin-induced c-Fos protein expression was also suppressed by sinomenine (50 mg/kg i.p.) in the superficial dorsal horn of spinal cord. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from small-sized dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons revealed that sinomenine reversibly increased the spike threshold and the threshold current intensity for evoking a single spike and decreased firing frequency of action potentials evoked in response to a long current pulse. Voltage-gated sodium currents (INa) were also significantly reduced by sinomenine in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 = 2.3 ± 0.2 mM). Finally, we confirmed that intraplantar application of sinomenine suppressed formalin-induced pain behavior only in the first phase, but not the second phase. Taken together, our results suggest that sinomenine has a peripheral analgesic effect by inhibiting INa.

AB  - Abstract
Few researchers have investigated the direction of commissural axon projections on the contralateral side of the vertebrate embryonic spinal cord, especially for comparison between its different regions. In this study, pCAGGS-GFP plasmid expression was limited to different regions of the chicken embryonic spinal cord (cervical, anterior limb, anterior thorax, posterior thorax and posterior limb) at E3 using in ovo electroporation with modified electrodes and optimal electroporation conditions. Then open-book technique was performed at E6 to analyze the direction of axon projections in different spinal cord regions. The results show that in the five investigated regions, most axons projected rostrally after crossing the floor plate while a minority projected caudally. And there was a significant difference between the rostral and caudal projection quantities (P &lt; 0.01). The ratio of rostral and caudal projections was significantly different between the five investigated regions (P &lt; 0.05), except between the cervical region and the anterior limb (P &gt; 0.05). The projections were most likely to be rostral for the posterior limb followed by the posterior thorax, cervical region, anterior limb and anterior thorax. Our data for the direction of the commissural axon projections will be helpful in the future analyses of axon projection mechanisms and spinal cord-brain circuit formation.

AB  - Abstract
Functional imaging studies have implicated the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus in cue-guided spatial navigation, but also many other regions. Furthermore, little is known about de-activations that take place during performance of navigation tasks, something that is of interest given that the hippocampus is a component of the default mode network, which de-activates during attention-demanding tasks. In this study 22 healthy subjects underwent whole-brain functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) while they navigated toward a previously learned goal in a virtual reality environment. At a threshold of p &lt; 0.05 corrected, the subjects showed a pattern of widespread cortical activations, including the parahippocampal and retrosplenial cortex and also parts of the frontal, temporal and occipital cortex. Hippocampal activation, however, was restricted to the posterior portion of the structure bilaterally. De-activations were seen in the medial frontal cortex and other regions of the default mode network, but not in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus. The findings support the involvement of the hippocampus in cue-guided navigation, but suggest that its posterior regions are particularly important. Cue-guided spatial navigation is associated with de-activation in some but not all parts of the default mode network.

AB  - Abstract
Cholinergic interneurons provide rich local innervation of the striatum and play an important role in controlling behavior, as evidenced by the variety of movement and psychiatric disorders linked to disrupted striatal cholinergic transmission. Much progress has been made in recent years regarding our understanding of how these interneurons contribute to the processing of information in the striatum. In particular, investigation of the activity of presumed striatal cholinergic interneurons, identified as tonically active neurons or TANs in behaving animals, has pointed to their role in the signaling and learning of the motivational relevance of environmental stimuli. Although the bulk of this work has been conducted in monkeys, several studies have also been carried out in behaving rats, but information remains rather disparate across studies and it is still questionable whether rodent TANs correspond to TANs described in monkeys. Consequently, our current understanding of the function of cholinergic transmission in the striatum is challenged by the rapidly growing, but often confusing literature on the relationship between TAN activity and specific behaviors. As regards the precise nature of the information conveyed by the cholinergic TANs, a recent influential view emphasized that these local circuit neurons may play a special role in the processing of contextual information that is important for reinforcement learning and selection of appropriate actions. This review provides a summary of recent progress in TAN physiology from which it is proposed that striatal cholinergic interneurons are crucial elements for flexible switching of behaviors under changing environmental conditions.

AB  - Abstract
The tyrosine kinases of the Syk family are essential components of the well-characterized immunoreceptor ITAM-based signaling pathway. However, ITAM-based signaling typically does not function in isolation. Instead, it is enmeshed in the molecular network controlling cellular adhesion and chemotaxis. Consistent with the increasing number of data involving ITAM-bearing molecules in neuronal functions, we previously depicted a role for Syk kinases in the establishment of neuronal connectivity. In the developing cerebellum, we found that Syk is essentially expressed in the granule cells (GC) and more importantly, phosphorylated on tyrosine residues representative of an active form of the kinase in tangentially migrating GC. In light of these findings, experiments were performed to establish the implication of Syk in this process. We showed that Syk state of phosphorylation is spatiotemporally regulated during GC ontogeny. Moreover, the analysis of external granular layer microexplants treated with a Syk pharmacological inhibitor together with the quantification of ectopic GC in Syk+/−; ZAP-70−/− mutant mice brought evidence of a requirement of Syk in GC tangential migration. Syk phosphorylation was induced by EphB2 engagement and locally turned down by a not yet identified factor that could in part explain the restricted pattern of Syk phosphorylation observed along GC migratory route. Whereas Syk kinase activity appeared not essential for ephrin/Eph-mediated axon extension, it might provide polarization signals required for proper nucleus translocation during GC migration. In conclusion, Syk kinase acts downstream of receptors controlling GC tangential migration.

AB  - Abstract
Global cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury (GCI/R) can lead to neuronal apoptosis and contributes to permanent neurological sequelae. However, the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the effects of GCI/R on the tribbles homolog 3 (TRB3) and to explore the role of TRB3 in GCI/R. The GCI/R model was developed in Sprague–Dawley male rats by four-vessel occlusion. Subsequently, the expressions of TRB3, endoplasmic reticulum stress markers, and apoptosis-associated proteins were examined by western blot at 1 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 72 h after GCI/R. TRB3 short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentivirus was constructed and used to investigate the role of TRB3 in GCI/R-induced neuronal apoptosis. GCI/R increased the level of TRB3, endoplasmic reticulum stress markers, and pro-apoptotic proteins. The level of protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation was reduced during GCI/R. Administration of TRB3 shRNA lentivirus attenuated GCI/R-induced up-regulation of TRB3, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, TRB3 shRNA lentivirus reversed the reduced level of Akt phosphorylation induced by GCI/R. These data implied that TRB3 participated in the GCI/R-induced neuronal apoptosis. Knocking down TRB3 attenuated endoplasmic reticulum stress, enhanced Akt phosphorylation, and protected neurons from apoptosis in response to GCI/R. These results demonstrated that the downregulation of TRB3 may be a promising approach for treating GCI/R.

AB  - Abstract
Tissue engineering protocols, such as regenerative endodontic procedures (REPs), comprise biologically based procedures designed to restore normal physiologic function. For REPs, the goal is reconstitution of the pulp-dentin complex by delivering mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), including the stem cells of the apical papilla (SCAP) into a root canal system. Many patients regain cold sensitivity after REPs, but the mechanism is not understood. We hypothesized that SCAP modulate nociceptive function through a paracrine mechanism that activates cold-sensitive ion channels in neurons. We established a co-culture system with human SCAP and rat trigeminal (TG) sensory neurons in order to determine the effect of SCAP co-culture on neuronal responses using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. TG neurons co-cultured with SCAP demonstrated increased TRPA1-mediated (p &lt; 0.01) and TRPM8-mediated inward current densities (p &lt; 0.01) at 24 h in co-culture. Cold stimulation to SCAP significantly increased ATP release (p &lt; 0.01), and supernatant collected after cold stimulation to SCAP was able to activate cultured TG neurons. Co-culture with SCAP significantly increased sustained ATP-evoked inward current density (p &lt; 0.05). These data suggest that SCAP release trophic factors that act on afferent neurons to enhance cold-sensitive ion channel activity.

AB  - Abstract
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) plays an important role in hearing function; however, the underlying mechanism remains indistinct. PVM/Ms from the stria vascularis of lateral wall of cochlea in young and aged mice were isolated, and the mRNA and protein expression levels were detected. MIF was knocked down or overexpresssed in vitro, and transfection was performed in vivo. Cell viability and apoptosis were determined by MTT assay and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. The hearing ability was tested by the auditory brain stem response. The results showed that MIF expression was significantly downregulated in aged mice. In aged mice, the viability of PVM/Ms significantly decreased, but the apoptotic number markedly increased. MIF knockdown in PVM/Ms in vitro significantly inhibited cell viability and induced cell apoptosis, but MIF overexpression showed contrasting results. Further studies showed that MIF knockdown in young mice resulted in serious hearing loss, but MIF overexpression in aged mice restored the hearing. Si-MIF inhibited the viability and induced apoptosis of PVM/Ms from young mice, whereas Ad-MIF induced the viability and inhibited apoptosis of PVM/Ms from aged mice. Moreover, MIF effectively altered the expression levels of CDK1, BRAF, p-ERK1/2, p-PI3K, and p-Akt. Furthermore, ERK inhibitor PD98059 or PI3K inhibitor LY294002 significantly reversed the effects of Si-MIF on PVM/Ms from young mice, whereas ERK activator EGF or PI3K activator IGF significantly reversed the effects of Ad-MIF on PVM/Ms from aged mice. Taken together, MIF mediates the viability and apoptosis of PVM/Ms, at least partially, through MAPK and/or PI3K/Akt pathway.

AB  - Abstract
Excessive inflammatory response produced after cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR) is one of major causes of cerebral injury. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine and its role in brain injury after CA/CPR is unclear. Herein we investigated whether blocking HMGB1 signaling could ease brain injury after CA/CPR. Male Sprague–Dawley rats (n = 181) were subjected to 8-min Asphyxia CA model or Sham operation. The ELISA data revealed both resuscitated patients and animals had elevated HMGB1 level in sera, compared with the healthy volunteers or Sham operative rats, respectively (P &lt; 0.01). Rats successfully resuscitated from CA were then randomly treated with either membrane permeable (TAT-fused) HMGB1 binding heptamer peptide (HBHP) or Scramble peptide. Results showed that HBHP treatment markedly improved 7-day survival rate, reduced neurological deficit scores, and prevented neuronal and dendrite loss in hippocampal CA1 region. Moreover, HBHP inhibited the activation of microglia and astrocytes and downregulated the mRNA and protein expressions of proinflammatory factors. We finally blocked toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4, one of HMGB1 receptors) with a specific antagonist TAK-242 before CA induction to confirm the detrimental effect of HMGB1 signaling and found blocking TLR4 could also attenuate the neuronal degeneration, as well as reduce NF-κB-mediated inflammatory signaling. Our findings indicate that CA/CPR can induce HMGB1 release to serum, while blocking HMGB1 signaling with peptide may improve the survival and attenuate post-resuscitation brain injury in the rat model of CA/CPR. TLR4 antagonist may also offer neuroprotective effects through weakening HMGB1-mediated proinflammatory reactions.

AB  - Abstract
Impaired olfaction is associated with a volume decrease in the olfactory bulb as well as in the gray matter of cortical olfactory areas. On the other hand, restitution of an impaired olfaction results in a regain of volume in these regions. Studies investigating similar changes in the cerebral white matter are virtually not existent. The aim of this prospective study therefore was to investigate cerebral white matter using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). 31 patients (54 ± 13 years) with olfactory impairment (chronic rhinosinusitis) and planned functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) were included. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data sets were acquired pre-operatively and 3 months after surgery. Pre- and postoperative olfactory testing was performed to assess the olfactory threshold, discrimination, and identification (TDI) score. A significant postoperative TDI improvement by 9.06 ± 8.81 points was observed. Two groups were subsequently formed – one with relevant postoperative olfactory gain (ΔTDI ≥ 10 points, 12 patients) and one without gain (ΔTDI &lt; 10 points, 19 patients). DTI parameter showed a significant correlation with the TDI score in the left anterior cingulate cortex and the right amygdala. In the group with relevant olfactory improvement higher values of fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient were found in the right parahippocampal area and in the white matter below the left inferior temporal sulcus. Tract-specific diffusion property analysis revealed significant group differences in the cingulate cortex in spatial relationship to the perisplenial cortex. Overall, this prospective study indicates structural changes in white matter after postoperative restoration of olfaction.

AB  - Abstract
The use of botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) for various clinical therapeutic applications is increasing. It is widely believed that peripheral therapeutic or toxic effects of BTX-A are exclusively mediated by SNAP-25 cleavage. There is growing evidence of long-distance retrograde axonal transport of BTX-A on entering the central nervous system, subsequent to a local injection of the toxin. However, the prevalence of central antinociceptive effects after BTX-A peripheral application and its underlying mechanisms are unclear. Our results show that (1) BTX-A can undergo retrograde axonal transport to the dorsal horn after peripheral application; (2) Peripheral pretreatment with BTX-A decreases the expression and function of AMPA receptors in the spinal cord dorsal horn neurons; (3) Peripheral pretreatment with BTX-A does not change basal glutamate release, but decreases the effect of formalin-evoked release of glutamate in spinal cord dorsal horn neurons. These results suggest that peripheral application of BTX-A can change AMPA receptor expression in, and glutamate release from, spinal dorsal horn neurons, which may have significance in its central antinociceptive effects.

AB  - Abstract
Structural connections among the hubs of the revised Papez circuit remain to be elucidated in the human brain. As the original Papez circuit failed to explain functional imaging findings, a more detailed investigation is needed to delineate connections among the circuit’s key hubs. Here we acquired diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) from eight normal subjects and used data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) to elucidate connections among hubs in the retrosplenial gyrus, hippocampus, mammillary bodies, and anterior thalamic nuclei. Our results show that the ventral hippocampal commissure (VHC) was visualized in all eight individual DSI datasets, as well as in the DSI and HCP group datasets, but a strictly defined VHC was only visualized in one individual dataset. Thalamic fibers were observed to connect with both the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC). The RSC was mainly responsible for direct hippocampal connections, while the PCC was not. This indicates that the RSC and PCC represent separate functional hubs in humans, as also shown by previous primate axonal tracing studies and functional magnetic resonance imaging observations.

AB  - Abstract
Elevated levels of oxidative stress and neuronal inflammation in the hypothalamus or ventral midbrain, respectively, represent common denominators for obesity and Parkinson’s Disease (PD). However, little is known about defense mechanisms that protect neurons in these regions from oxidative damage. Here, we aimed to assess whether murine Gpx4, a crucial antioxidant enzyme that protects neurons from membrane damage and ferroptosis, is critical for the protection from neuronal inflammation in two distinct pathophysiologic diseases, namely metabolic dysfunction in diet-induced obesity or PD. Gpx4 was deleted from either AgRP or POMC neurons in the hypothalamus, essential for metabolic homeostasis, or from dopaminergic neurons in the ventral midbrain, governing behaviors such as anxiety or voluntary movement. To induce a pro-inflammatory environment, AgRP and POMC neuron-specific Gpx4 knockout mice were subjected to high-fat high-sucrose (HFHS) diet. To exacerbate oxidative stress in dopaminergic neurons of the ventral midbrain, we systemically co-deleted the PD-related gene DJ-1. Gpx4 was dispensable for the maintenance of cellular health and function of POMC neurons, even in mice exposed to obesogenic conditions. In contrast, HFHS-fed mice with Gpx4 deletion from AgRP neurons displayed increased body adiposity. Gpx4 expression and activity were diminished in the hypothalamus of HFHS-fed mice compared to standard diet-fed controls. Gpx4 deletion from dopaminergic neurons induced anxiety behavior, and diminished spontaneous locomotor activity when DJ-1 was co-deleted. Overall, these data suggest a physiological role for Gpx4 in balancing metabolic control signals and inflammation in AgRP but not POMC neurons. Moreover, Gpx4 appears to constitute an important rheostat against neuronal dysfunction and PD-like symptoms in dopaminergic circuitry within the ventral midbrain.

AB  - Abstract
The central command for breathing arises mainly from two interconnected rhythmogenic hindbrain networks, the parafacial respiratory group (pFRG or epF at embryonic stages) and the preBötzinger complex (preBötC), which are comprised of a limited number of neurons located in confined regions of the ventral medulla. In rodents, both networks become active toward the end of gestation but little is known about the signaling pathways involved in their anatomical and functional establishment during embryogenesis. During embryonic development, epF and preBötC neurons migrate from their territories of origin to their final positions in ventral brainstem areas. Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling, including the molecule Scrib, is known to control the developmental migration of several hindbrain neuronal groups. Accordingly, a homozygous mutation of Scrib leads to severe disruption of hindbrain anatomy and function. Here, we aimed to determine whether Scrib is also involved in the prenatal development of the hindbrain nuclei controlling breathing. We combined immunostaining, calcium imaging and electrophysiological recordings of neuronal activity in isolated in vitro preparations. In the Scrib mutant, despite severe neural tube defects, epF and preBötC neurons settled at their expected hindbrain positions. Furthermore, both networks remained capable of generating rhythmically organized, respiratory-related activities and exhibited normal sensitivity to pharmacological agents known to modify respiratory circuit function. Thus Scrib is not required for the proper migration of epF and preBötC neurons during mouse embryogenesis. Our findings thus further illustrate the robustness and specificity of the developmental processes involved in the establishment of hindbrain respiratory circuits.

AB  - Abstract
Resveratrol (3,5,4′-stilbenetriol), a natural polyphenol produced by various plants, has attracted attention over the past decade because of its multiple beneficial properties, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and chemopreventive, yet, there is limited information about its antiepileptic effects. Moreover, its poor solubility in water and low bioavailability are the challenging issues. In the present study, we aimed to investigate effects of free resveratrol and resveratrol delivered in amphipathic liposomal delivery system, which has a high blood–brain barrier crossing potential, on penicillin-induced epileptic seizure model. For this purpose, adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into four groups as saline (Control), liposome (LIP), free resveratrol (RES) and resveratrol + liposome (RES + LIP). Penicillin-induced epileptic activity was recorded for 120 min by electrocorticography. Glutathione S-transferase (GST), Glutathione (GSH), Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Malondialdehyde (MDA) assays were performed in brain tissues collected. Our results showed that RES + LIP was the most effective anticonvulsant treatment on penicillin-induced epileptic seizures when compared to control, as RES + LIP immediately decreased the number of spikes per minute. GST and SOD activity, as well as the GSH levels, were significantly increased in the RES + LIP group as compared with the control group. Also, the MDA levels were significantly higher in the RES + LIP compared to RES and control groups. In conclusion, RES + LIP treatment was more effective on the decrease in spike frequency and spike amplitudes than other treatments. Our results suggest that the RES + LIP is more effective than RES on penicillin-induced epileptiform activity.

AB  - Abstract
The ε4 allelic variant of the Apolipoprotein E gene (APOE ε4) is the best-established genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD). White matter (WM) microstructural damages measured with Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) represent an early sign of fiber tract disconnection in AD. We examined the impact of APOE ε4 on WM microstructure in elderly individuals from the multicenter European DTI Study on Dementia. Voxelwise statistical analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity, radial and axial diffusivity (MD, radD and axD respectively) was carried out using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics. Seventy-four healthy elderly individuals – 31 APOE ε4 carriers (APOE ε4+) and 43 APOE ε4 non-carriers (APOE ε4−) –were considered for data analysis. All the results were corrected for scanner acquisition protocols, age, gender and for multiple comparisons. APOE ε4+ and APOE ε4− subjects were comparable regarding sociodemographic features and global cognition. A significant reduction of FA and increased radD was found in the APOE ε4+ compared to the APOE ε4− in the cingulum, in the corpus callosum, in the inferior fronto-occipital and in the inferior longitudinal fasciculi, internal and external capsule. APOE ε4+, compared to APOE ε4− showed higher MD in the genu, right internal capsule, superior longitudinal fasciculus and corona radiate. Comparisons stratified by center supported the results obtained on the whole sample. These findings support previous evidence in monocentric studies indicating a modulatory role of APOE ɛ4 allele on WM microstructure in elderly individuals at risk for AD suggesting early vulnerability and/or reduced resilience of WM tracts involved in AD.

AB  - Abstract
It has been suggested that the brain adopts a simplified strategy to coordinate a large number of degrees of freedom in motor control. Synergies have been proposed as a strategy to produce movements by recruitment of a small number of fixed modular patterns. However, there is no direct support for a synergistic organization of the brain itself. In this study, we recorded neural activities from the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) of monkeys trained to reach and grasp differently shaped objects (grasping task) or the same object in different positions (reaching task). Non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) was applied to the neural data to extract neural synergies, whose functional roles were verified in several ways. We found that motor cortex used similar neural synergies for grasping different objects; combining only a few of the synergies accounted for most of the variance in the original data. When used for single-trial task decoding, the synergy coefficients performed as well and robustly as the original data in both tasks. The synergy amplitudes for each unit were significantly correlated with the corresponding neuron’s firing rate. In addition, we also observed synergies shared between tasks and task-specific synergies, as shown before for muscle synergies. Altogether, we demonstrated that neural synergies are effective in describing neural population activity during reach to grasp movements and provide a new tool for interpreting neural data for movement control.

The molecular mechanism of individual response of susceptibility and resilience under psychological stress remains controversial and unclear. The present study aimed to explore the relationship of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) with glucocorticoid receptor (GR) or cannabinoid receptor (CB1) and further indicate the molecular mechanism of susceptibility and resilience to acute stress (AS) and chronic mild stress (CMS). Sucrose preference test and open field test were used to evaluate the response of susceptibility and resilience under stress in rats. The mRNA levels and protein expressions of mGluR5, GR, and CB1 were detected. AS induced a 35% reduction in the sucrose intake of rats, and these rats were considered as susceptible to stress; 21% of the rats showed resilience to the stress. Thirty-three percent of rats in the CMS group showed reduced sucrose water intake and were considered susceptible, while 20% of rats were considered resilient. Hippocampal mGluR5 mRNA and protein levels were increased in the susceptible rats. Pharmacological testing showed that GR was positively associated with mGluR5 in susceptible rats in the CMS group, while CB1 was negatively related to mGluR5 in susceptible rats in the AS group. The results suggested that GR and CB1 in the hippocampus might regulate mGluR5 protein and mRNA levels, which might be related to individual responses of susceptibility and resilience under AS and CMS.

AB  - Abstract
In mammals, the master circadian clock resides in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN is characterized by robust circadian oscillations of clock gene expression and neuronal firing. The synchronization of circadian oscillations among individual cells in the SCN is attributed to intercellular coupling. Previous studies have shown that gap junctions, specifically those composed of connexin-36 (Cx36) subunits, are required for coupling of electrical firing among SCN neurons at a time scale of milliseconds. However, it remains unknown whether Cx36 gap junctions also contribute to coupling of circadian (∼24 h) rhythms of clock gene expression. Here, we investigated circadian expression patterns of the clock gene Period 2 (Per2) in the SCN of Cx36-deficient mice using luminometry and single-cell bioluminescence imaging. Surprisingly, we found that synchronization of circadian PER2 expression rhythms is maintained in SCN explants from Cx36-deficient mice. Since Cx36 expression levels change with age, we also tested circadian running-wheel behavior of juvenile (3–4 weeks old) and adult (9–30 weeks old) Cx36-deficient mice. We found that impact of connexin-36 expression on circadian behavior changes greatly during postnatal development. However, consistent with the intact synchrony among SCN cells in cultured explants, Cx36-deficient mice had intact locomotor circadian rhythms, although adults displayed a lengthened period in constant darkness. Our data indicate that even though Cx36 may be required for electrical coupling of SCN cells, it does not affect coupling of molecular clock gene rhythms. Thus, electrical coupling of neurons and coupling of circadian clock gene oscillations can be regulated independently in the SCN.

AB  - Abstract
The Aristaless-related homeobox gene (ARX) is indispensable for interneuron development. Patients with ARX polyalanine expansion mutations of the first two tracts (namely PA1 and PA2) suffer from intellectual disability of varying severity, with seizures a frequent comorbidity. The impact of PA1 and PA2 mutations on the brain development is unknown, hindering the search for therapeutic interventions. Here, we characterized the disturbances to cortical interneuron development in mice modeling the two most common ARX polyalanine expansion mutations in human. We found a consistent ∼40–50% reduction of calbindin-positive interneurons, but not Stt+ or Cr+ interneurons, within the cortex of newborn hemizygous mice (p = 0.024) for both mutant strains compared to wildtype (p = 0.011). We demonstrate that this was a consequence of calbindin precursor cells being arrested or delayed at the ventral subpallium en route of tangential migration. Ex-vivo assay validated this migration deficit in PA1 cells (p = 0.0002) suggesting that the defect is contributed by intrinsic loss of Arx function within migrating cells. Both humans and mice with PA1 mutations present with severe clinical features, including intellectual disability and infantile spasms. Our data further demonstrated the pathogenic mechanism was robustly shared between PA1 and PA2 mutations, as previously reported including Arx protein reduction and overlapping transcriptome profiles within the developing mouse brains. Data from our study demonstrated that cortical calbindin interneuron development and migration is negatively affected by ARX polyalanine expansion mutations. Understanding the cellular pathogenesis contributing to disease manifestation is necessary to screen efficacy of potential therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Abstract
Dysfunction of thalamo-cortical networks involving particularly the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is implicated in schizophrenia. In the neonatal ventral hippocampal lesion (NVHL), a heuristic animal model of schizophrenia, brain oscillation changes similar to those of schizophrenic patients have been reported. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of short-term deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the thalamic reticular nucleus on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in the NVHL. Male and female Sprague–Dawley rats were used and the model was prepared by excitotoxicity damage of the ventral hippocampus on postnatal day 7 (PD-7). Chronic bilateral stainless steel electrodes were implanted in the TRN, thalamic dorsomedial nucleus and prelimbic area at PD-90. Rats were classified as follows: sham and NVHL groups, both groups received bilateral DBS in the TRN for one hour (100 Hz, 100 µs pulses, 200 µA). All animals showed a sudden behavioral arrest accompanied by widespread symmetric bilateral spike–wave discharges, this activity was affected by DBS-TRN. Additionally, the power spectra of 0.5–100 Hz and the coherence of 0.5–4.5 and 35–55 Hz frequencies were modified by DBS-TRN. Our results suggest that DBS in the TRN may modify functional connectivity between different parts of the thalamo-cortical network. Additionally, our findings may suggest a beneficial effect of DBS-TRN on some preclinical aberrant oscillatory activities in a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia.

Stimulation as well as inhibition of GABAB (Gamma amino butyric acid) receptors has been reported to show beneficial effects in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Experimental evidences suggest that the use of GABAergic agents could influence learning and memory. The present study was designed to investigate the possible role of GABAB receptors in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced behavioral and biochemical abnormalities in rats. Herein STZ was infused (3 mg/kg) bilaterally on alternate days (day 1 and day 3) to produce experimental dementia in rats. STZ-infused rats were then treated with baclofen (GABABR agonist) 5 and 10 mg/kg i.p. and CGP35348 (GABABR antagonist) 25 and 50 mg/kg i.p. one week following STZ infusion for 15 days. Cognitive functions were assessed by using Morris water maze (MWM) and object recognition task (ORT). Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA.), reduced glutathione (GSH), andacetylcholinesterase (AChE) were determined to evaluate oxidative stress and cholinergic function. STZ-infused rats showed decreased memory retention, elevated levels of MDA, increased AChE activity, reduced GSH levels. The combination of STZ with increasing doses of Baclofen further induced a higher decrease in memory retention and increase in oxidative stress. CGP35348 restored cognitive functions and AChE activity in STZ-infused rats. The cognitive enhancement following CGP35348 may be due to its ability to restore cholinergic, serotonergic and dopaminergic function, and its antioxidant activity. Therefore, it would be safe to conclude that the pharmacological blockade of GABAB receptors would be therapeutic in the management of cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.

AB  - Abstract
Objective: In experimental models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), brain neurons manifest multiple changes in intrinsic excitability that contribute to neuronal network hyperexcitability. We have investigated whether the intrinsic firing response gain, quantified by the slope of the function relating the number of evoked spikes (Ns) to input excitatory current intensity (I), is modified in principal rat hippocampal neurons in the pilocarpine-status epilepticus (SE) model of TLE. Methods: Intracellular recordings were made in CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs) and dentate granule cells (GCs) in acute hippocampal slices obtained 7–36 days after pilocarpine-SE. Firing response gains were determined empirically from Ns/I relationships and compared to other measured neuronal properties. Results: The firing response gain in all three types of principal neurons, particularly in CA3 PCs, was markedly multiplied following pilocarpine-SE. Analyses of persistent changes in active and passive properties of CA3 PCs suggested that this increase is multifactorial in origin, the major factors being a reduction in amplitude of the slow afterhyperpolarization and an increase in the fraction of bursting neurons. Significance: Here we show that pilocarpine-SE causes multiplication of the firing response gain in the three principal neurons in the hippocampal trisynaptic pathway. This alteration undoubtedly would contribute to hippocampal hyperexcitability in SE-induced TLE.

Recent studies have reported that there are individual differences in working memory (WM), and that WM may be affected by emotions. To date, it remains controversial whether emotions impair or facilitate WM and whether there are individual differences in their effect on WM. In this study, three emotions (negative, neutral, and positive) were induced by a video database that was established according to the emotional stimuli habit of Chinese people. A change detection paradigm was used to examine the effect of emotions on the visual WM. Participants were divided into high- and low-capacity groups according to their WM capacity. The behavioral results revealed that both negative and positive emotions may enhance WM capacity in the high-capacity group compared with the neutral emotion. In contrast, an opposite effect was observed in the low-capacity group. Analysis of the contralateral delay activity and P300 components demonstrated significantly higher amplitudes in the high-capacity group following positive and negative emotions; the effects were opposite in the low-capacity group. The event-related spectral perturbation results demonstrated a more powerful event-related synchronization in the alpha-band (300–400 ms) in the low-capacity group in positive and negative emotions; opposite results were observed in the high-capacity group. The consistence of the behavioral and electrophysiological results suggests interindividual differences in the impact of emotions on the WM capacity. Moreover, both positive and negative emotions can facilitate WM capacity in the high-capacity group, while they impair WM capacity in the low-capacity group.

AB  - Abstract
The performance of a cochlear implant depends on the defined interaction between afferent neurons of the spiral ganglion and the inserted electrode. Neurite outgrowth can be induced by neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) via tropomyosin kinase receptor B (TrkB). However, neurotrophin signaling through the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75) inhibits neurite outgrowth in the presence of myelin.

Organotypic cultures derived from postnatal (P3-5) mice were used to study myelin-induced inhibition in the cochlear spiral ganglion. Neurite outgrowth was analyzed and quantified utilizing an adapted Sholl analysis. Stimulation of neurite outgrowth was quantified after application of BDNF, the selective TrkB agonist 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) and a selective inhibitor of the Rho-associated kinase (Y27632), which inhibits the p75 pathway. Myelin-induced inhibition was assessed by application of myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG-Fc) to stimulate the inhibitory p75 pathway. Inhibition of neurite outgrowth was achieved by the selective TrkB inhibitor K252a.

Stimulation of neurite outgrowth was observed after treatment with BDNF, 7,8 DHF and a combination of BDNF and Y27632. The 7,8-DHF-induced growth effects could be inhibited by K252a. Furthermore, inhibition of neurite outgrowth was observed after supplementation with MAG-Fc. Myelin-induced inhibition could be overcome by 7,8-DHF and the combination of BDNF and Y27632.

In this study, myelin-induced inhibition of neurite outgrowth was established in a spiral ganglion model. We reveal that 7,8-DHF is a viable novel compound for the stimulation of neurite outgrowth in a myelin-induced inhibitory environment. The combination of TrkB stimulation and ROCK inhibition can be used to overcome myelin inhibition.

AB  - Abstract
Somatosensory input induced by passive movement activates primary motor cortex (M1). We applied repetitive passive movement (RPM) of different frequencies to test if modulation of M1 excitability depends on RPM frequency. Twenty-seven healthy subjects participated in this study. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to left M1 were recorded from the right first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) to assess corticospinal excitability (experiment 1: n = 15), and F-waves were measured from the right FDI as an index of spinal motoneuron excitability (experiment 2: n = 15). Passive abduction/adduction of the right index finger was applied for 10 min at 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 Hz. Both 0.5 Hz-RPM and 1.0 Hz-RPM decreased MEPs for 2 min (p &lt; 0.05), and 5.0 Hz-RPM decreased MEPs for 15 min compared with baseline (p &lt; 0.05); however, there was no difference in MEPs after 3.0 Hz-RPM. No F-wave changes were observed following any RPM intervention. Based on the results of experiments 1 and 2, we investigated whether RPM modulates cortical inhibitory circuit using the paired-pulse TMS technique (experiment 3: n = 12). Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) was measured using paired-pulse TMS (inter-stimulus interval of 3 ms) before and after 1.0, 3.0, and 5.0 Hz-RPM. Both 1.0 and 5.0 Hz-RPM increased SICI compared with baseline (p &lt; 0.05). These experiments suggest that M1 excitability decreases after RPM depending on movement frequency, possibly through frequency-dependent enhancement of cortical inhibitory circuit in M1.

AB  - Abstract
Zinc-α2-glycoprotein (ZAG) is a 42-kDa protein encoded by the AZGP1 gene that is known as a lipid mobilizing factor and is highly homologous to major histocompatibility complex class I family molecules. Recently, transcriptomic research has shown that AZGP1 expression is reduced in the brain tissue of epilepsy patients. However, the cellular distribution and biological role of ZAG in the brain and epilepsy are unclear. Patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and brain trauma were included in this study, and pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-kindled rats were also used. The existence and level of ZAG in the brain were identified using immunohistochemistry, double-labeled immunofluorescence and western blot, and the expression level of AZGP1 mRNA was determined with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qrt-PCR). To explore the potential biological role of ZAG in the brain, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) of phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK), TGF-β1 and ZAG was also performed. ZAG was found in the cytoplasm of neurons in brain tissue from both patients and rats. The levels of AZGP1 mRNA and ZAG were lower in refractory TLE patients and PTZ-kindled rats than in controls. In addition, the ZAG level decreased as PTZ kindling continued. Co-IP identified direct binding between p-ERK, TGF-β1 and ZAG. ZAG was found to be synthesized in neurons, and both the AZGP1 mRNA and ZAG protein levels were decreased in epilepsy patients and rat models. The reduction in ZAG may participate in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of epilepsy by interacting with p-ERK and TGF-β1, promoting inflammation, regulating the metabolism of ketone bodies, or affecting other epilepsy-related molecules.

AB  - Abstract
Striatal cholinergic dysfunction has been suggested to play a critical role in the pathophysiology of dystonia. In the dtsz hamster, a phenotypic model of paroxysmal dystonia, M1 antagonists exerted moderate antidystonic efficacy after acute systemic administration. In the present study, we examined the effects of the M4 preferring antagonist tropicamid and whether long-term systemic or acute intrastriatal injections of the M1 preferring antagonist trihexyphenidyl are more effective in mutant hamsters. Furthermore, M1 and M4 receptors were analyzed by autoradiography and immunohistochemistry. Tropicamide retarded the onset of dystonic attacks, as previously observed after acute systemic administration of trihexyphenidyl. Combined systemic administration of trihexyphenidyl (30 mg/kg) and tropicamide (15 mg/kg) reduced the severity in acute trials and delayed the onset of dystonia during long-term treatment. In contrast, acute striatal microinjections of trihexyphenidyl, tropicamid or the positive allosteric M4 receptor modulator VU0152100 did not exert significant effects. Receptor analyses revealed changes of M1 receptors in the dorsomedial striatum, suggesting that the cholinergic system is involved in abnormal striatal plasticity in dtsz hamsters, but the pharmacological data argue against a crucial role on the phenotype in this animal model. However, antidystonic effects of tropicamide after systemic administration point to a novel therapeutic potential of M4 preferring anticholinergics for the treatment of dystonia.

AB  - Abstract
The post-transductional elaboration of sensory input at the frog semicircular canal has been studied by correlating the effects of drugs that interfere with phosphorylation processes on: (i) potassium conductances in isolated hair cell and (ii) transmitter release at the cytoneural junction in the intact labyrinth. At hair cells, delayed potassium currents (IKD) undergo voltage- and time-dependent inactivation; inactivation removal requires ATP, is sensitive to kinase blockade, but is unaffected by exogenous application of cyclic nucleotides. We report here that forskolin, an activator of endogenous adenylyl cyclase, enhances IKD inactivation removal in isolated hair cells, but produces an overall decrease in IKD amplitude consistent with the direct blocking action of the drug on several families of K channels. In the intact labyrinth, forskolin enhances transmitter release, consistent with such depression of K conductances. Kinase blockers – H-89 and KT5823 – have been shown to reduce IKD inactivation removal and IKD amplitude at isolated hair cells. In the labyrinth, the effects of these drugs on junctional activity are quite variable, with predominant inhibition of transmitter release, rather than the enhancement expected from the impairment of K currents. The overall action of forskolin and kinase inhibitors on K conductances is similar (depression), but they have opposite effects on transmitter release: this indicates that some intermediate steps between the bioelectric control of hair cell membrane potential and transmitter release are affected in opposite ways and therefore are presumably regulated by protein phosphorylation.

AB  - Abstract
Neuroscientists have often described the adult brain in similar terms to an electronic circuit board– dependent on fixed, precise connectivity. However, with the advent of technologies allowing chronic measurements of neural structure and function, the emerging picture is that neural networks undergo significant remodeling over multiple timescales, even in the absence of experimenter-induced learning or sensory perturbation. Here, we attempt to reconcile the parallel observations that critical brain functions are stably maintained, while synapse- and single-cell properties appear to be reformatted regularly throughout adult life. In this review, we discuss experimental evidence at multiple levels ranging from synapses to neuronal ensembles, suggesting that many parameters are maintained in a dynamic equilibrium. We highlight emerging hypotheses that could explain how stable brain functions may be generated from dynamic elements. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of dynamic circuit elements on neural computations, and how they could provide living neural circuits with computational abilities a fixed structure cannot offer. Taken together, recent evidence indicates that continuous dynamics are a fundamental property of neural circuits compatible with macroscopically stable behaviors. In addition, they may be a unique advantage imparting robustness and flexibility throughout life.

AB  - Abstract
Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which impaired decision-making and goal-directed behaviors are core features. One of the genes associated with schizophrenia is the Close Homolog of L1 (CHL1); CHL1-deficient mice are considered a model of schizophrenia-like deficits, including sensorimotor gating, interval timing and spatial memory impairments. Here we investigated temporal discounting in CHL1-deficient (KO) mice and their wild-type littermates. Although no discounting differences were found under baseline conditions, CHL1-KO mice showed increased impulsive choice following chronic unpredictable stress (fewer % larger-later choices, and reduced area under the discounting curve). Stressed CHL1-KO mice also showed decreased neuronal activation (number of cFos positive neurons) in the discounting task in the prelimbic cortex and dorsal striatum, areas thought to be part of executive and temporal processing circuits. Impulsive choice alterations were reversed by the 5-HT2C agonist Ro 60-0175. Our results provide evidence for a gene x environment, double-hit model of stress-related decision-making impairments, and identify CHL1-deficient mice as a mouse model for these deficits in regard to schizophrenia-like phenotypes.

AB  - Abstract
Executive control requires behavioral adaptation to environmental contingencies. In the stop signal task (SST), participants exhibit slower go trial reaction time (RT) following a stop trial, whether or not they successfully interrupt the motor response. In previous fMRI studies, we demonstrated activation of the right-hemispheric ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, in the area of inferior frontal gyrus, pars opercularis (IFGpo) and anterior insula (AI), during post-error slowing (PES). However, in similar analyses we were not able to identify regional activities during post-success slowing (PSS). Here, we revisited this issue in a larger sample of participants (n = 100) each performing the SST for 40 min during fMRI. We replicated IFGpo/AI activation to PES (p ≤ 0.05, FWE corrected). Further, PSS engages decreased activation in a number of cortical regions including the left inferior frontal cortex (IFC; p ≤ 0.05, FWE corrected). We employed Granger causality mapping to identify areas that provide inputs each to the right IFGpo/AI and left IFC, and computed single-trial amplitude (STA) of stop trials of these input regions as well as the STA of post-stop trials of the right IFGpo/AI and left IFC. The STAs of the right inferior precentral sulcus and supplementary motor area (SMA) and right IFGpo/AI were positively correlated and the STAs of the left SMA and left IFC were positively correlated (slope &gt; 0, p’s ≤ 0.01, one-sample t test), linking regional responses during stop success and error trials to those during PSS and PES. These findings suggest distinct neural mechanisms to support PSS and PES.

AB  - AbstractObjective
The cortico–thalamo–cortical network plays a key role in childhood absence epilepsy (CAE). However, the exact interaction between the cortex and the thalamus remains incompletely understood. This study aimed to investigate the dynamic changes of frequency-dependent neural networks during the initialization of absence seizures.
Methods
Magnetoencephalography data from 14 patients with CAE were recorded during and between seizures at a sampling rate of 6000 Hz and analyzed in seven frequency bands. Neuromagnetic sources were volumetrically scanned with accumulated source imaging. Effective connectivity networks of the entire brain, including the cortico–thalamo–cortical network, were evaluated at the source level through Granger causality analysis.
Results
The low-frequency (1–80 Hz) activities showed significant frontal cortical and parieto–occipito–temporal junction source localization around seizures. The high-frequency (80–250 Hz) oscillations showed predominant activities consistently localized in deep brain areas and medial frontal cortex. The increased cortico–thalamic effective connectivity was observed around seizures in both low- and high-frequency ranges. The direction was predominantly from the cortex to the thalamus at the early time, although the cortex that drove connectivity varied among subjects.
Conclusions
The cerebral cortex plays a key role in driving the cortico–thalamic connections at the early portion of the initialization of absence seizures. The oscillatory activities in the thalamus could be triggered by networks from various regions in the cortex.
Significance
The dynamic changes of neural network provide evidences that absence seizures are probably resulted from cortical initialized cortico–thalamic network.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic stress produces differential dendritic remodeling of pyramidal neurons in medial prefrontal cortex of male and female rats. In males, this dendritic remodeling is reversible. However, the timeline of recovery, as well as the potential for reversibility in females, is unknown. Here, we examined dendritic recovery of pyramidal neurons in layer II-II of prelimbic cortex in male and female rats following chronic restraint stress (3 h/day for 10 days). Dendritic morphology and spine density were analyzed immediately following the cessation of stress, or following a 7- or 10-day recovery period. Chronic stress produced apical dendritic retraction in males, which was coupled with a decrease in the density of stubby spine on apical dendrites. Further, following a 10-day recovery period, the morphology of neurons from stressed rats resembled that of unstressed rats. Male rats given a 7-day recovery period had apical dendritic outgrowth compared to unstressed rats. Immediately after cessation of stress, females showed only minimal dendritic remodeling. The morphology of neurons in stressed females resembled those of unstressed rats following only 7 days of recovery, at which time there was also a significant increase in stubby spine density. Males and females also showed different changes in baseline corticosterone concentrations during recovery. These findings not only indicate that dendritic remodeling in prelimbic cortex following chronic stress is different between males and females, but also suggest chronic stress induces differential hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis dysregulation in males and females. These differences may have important implications for responses to subsequent stressors.

AB  - Abstract
Human musical ability is proposed to play a key phylogenetical role in the evolution of language, and the similarity of hierarchical structure in music and language has led to considerable speculation about their shared mechanisms. While behavioral and electrophysioglocial studies have revealed associations between music and linguistic abilities, results from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies on their relations are contradictory, possibly because these studies usually treat music or language as single entities without breaking down to their components. Here, we examined the relations between different components of music (i.e., melodic and rhythmic analysis) and language (i.e., semantic and phonological processing) using both behavioral tests and resting-state fMRI. Behaviorally, we found that individuals with music training experiences were better at semantic processing, but not at phonological processing, than those without training. Further correlation analyses showed that semantic processing of language was related to melodic, but not rhythmic, analysis of music. Neurally, we found that performances in both semantic processing and melodic analysis were correlated with spontaneous brain activities in the bilateral precentral gyrus (PCG) and superior temporal plane at the regional level, and with the resting-state functional connectivity of the left PCG with the left supramarginal gyrus and left superior temporal gyrus at the network level. Together, our study revealed the shared spontaneous neural basis of music and language based on the behavioral link between melodic analysis and semantic processing, which possibly relied on a common mechanism of automatic auditory-motor integration.

AB  - Abstract
It is not known whether, during the course of aging, changes occur in the motor strategies used by the CNS for lifting objects of different weights. Here, we analyzed the kinematics of object-lifting in two different healthy groups (young and elderly people) plus one well-known deafferented patient (GL). The task was to reach and lift onto a shelf an opaque cylindrical object with changing weight. The movements of the hand and object were recorded with electromagnetic sensors. In an ecological context (i.e. no instruction was given about movement speed), we found that younger participants, elderly people and GL did not all move at the same speed and that, surprisingly, elder people are faster. We also observed that the lifting trajectories were constant for both the elderly and the deafferented patient while younger participants raised their hand higher when the object weighed more. It appears that, depending on age and on available proprioceptive information, the CNS uses different strategies of lifting. We suggest that elder people tend to optimize their feedforward control in order to compensate for less functional afferent feedback, perhaps to optimize movement time and energy expenditure at the expense of high precision. In the case of complete loss of proprioceptive input, however, compensation follows a different strategy as suggested by GL’s behavior who moved more slowly compared to both our younger and older participants.

AB  - Abstract
Since the discovery of intrinsic photosensitive retinal ganglion cell (ipRGC) was reported in 2002, many features specific to this cell type have been described. However, scare information is available on the retinographic components directly reflecting ipRGC activity. In this study, we identified the electroretinogram (microERG) that reflects the photoresponses by ipRGCs in ex vivo preparations of the mouse retina, in which classical photoreceptors (cones and rods) were ablated mechanically and photochemically. MicroERG consisted of three components: a large transient ON response, a small and lazy hump 19 s after the onset of the light, and a large transient OFF response. A complete microERG recording required at least 30 s of light exposure. MicroERG showed the highest spectral photosensitivity at 478 nm. This wavelength corresponds to the peak wavelength in the ipRGCs’ photosensitive curve. The psychophysical test using a blue light-emitting diode (LED) light (470 nm) revealed that the absolute threshold illuminance for microERG was greater than 12.26 log photons/s/cm2 in both ON and OFF responses, whereas microERG was not adapted for dark. The amplitude of microERG increased linearly with irradiance. The sensitivity of temporal frequency was high in microERG (at least 100 Hz), as suggested by the study on melatonin suppression by flickering light in human subjects (Zelter et al., 2014). Melatonin secretion was suppressed by light via ipRGCs and the suprachiasmatic nucleus. These properties of the photoresponse indicate that microERG may reflect the functions of ipRGC as a luminance detector in the mouse retina.

AB  - Abstract
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor and cognitive domains of the CNS. Mutations in the Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) cause 20% of familial ALS and provoke formation of intracellular aggregates and copper and zinc unbinding, leading to glial activation and neurodegeneration. Therefore, we investigated glial cell morphology, intracellular SOD1 distribution, and elemental composition in the brainstem and hippocampus of the hSOD1G93A transgenic rat model of ALS. Immunostaining for astrocytes, microglia and SOD1 revealed glial proliferation and progressive tissue accumulation of SOD1 in both brain regions of ALS rats starting already at the presymptomatic stage. Glial cell morphology analysis in the brainstem of ALS rats revealed astrocyte activation occurring before disease symptoms onset, followed by activation of microglia. Hippocampal ALS astrocytes exhibited an identical reactive profile, while microglial morphology was unchanged. Additionally, ALS brainstem astrocytes demonstrated progressive SOD1 accumulation in the cell body and processes, while microglial SOD1 levels were reduced and its distribution limited to distal cell processes. In the hippocampus both glial cell types exhibited SOD1 accumulation in the cell body. X-ray fluorescence imaging revealed decreased P and increased Ca, Cl, K, Ni, Cu and Zn in the brainstem, and higher levels of Cl, Ni and Cu, but lower levels of Zn in the hippocampus of symptomatic ALS rats. These results bring new insights into the glial response during disease development and progression in motor as well as in non-motor CNS structures, and indicate disturbed tissue elemental homeostasis as a prominent hallmark of disease pathology.

AB  - Abstract
The sensorimotor cortical system undergoes structural and functional changes across its lifespan. Some of these changes are physiological and parallel the normal aging process, while others might represent pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative disorders. In the last years, the study of possible age-related modifications in brain sensorimotor functional characteristics has been the focus of several research projects. Here we have used the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-electroencephalography (EEG) navigated co-registration to investigate the influence of physiological aging on the excitability and connectivity of the human sensorimotor cortical system. To this end, we compared the TMS-evoked EEG potentials (TEPs) collected after stimulating the dominant primary motor cortex (M1) in healthy young subjects (mean age 24.5 years) with those collected in healthy older adults (mean age 67.6 years). We have shown that, after stimulation of the left motor cortex, TEPs are significantly affected by physiological aging. This phenomenon has a clear spatio-temporal specificity and we speculate that normal aging per se leads to some changes in the excitability of specific cortical neural assemblies whereas other alterations could reflect compensatory mechanisms to such changes.

AB  - Abstract
During postnatal development, neural circuits are extremely dynamic and develop precise connection patterns that emerge as a result of the elimination of synaptic terminals, a process instructed by molecular cues and patterns of electrical activity. In the rodent visual system, this process begins during the first postnatal week and proceeds during the second and third postnatal weeks as spontaneous retinal activity and finally use-dependent fine tuning takes place. Reelin is a large extracellular matrix glycoprotein able to affect several steps of brain development, from neuronal migration to the maturation of dendritic spines and use-dependent synaptic development. In the present study, we investigated the role of reelin on the topographical refinement of primary sensory connections studying the development of retinal ganglion cell axon terminals in the rat superior colliculus. We found that reelin levels in the visual layers of the superior colliculus are the highest between the second and third postnatal weeks. Blocking reelin signaling with a neutralizing antibody (CR-50) from PND 7 to PND 14 induced a non-specific sprouting of ipsilateral retinocollicular axons outside their typical distribution of discrete patches of axon terminals. Also we found that reelin blockade resulted in reduced levels of phospho-GAP43, increased GluN1 and GluN2B-NMDA subunits and decreased levels of GAD65 content in the visual layers of the superior colliculus. The results suggest that reelin signaling is associated with the maturation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic machinery influencing the development and fine tuning of topographically organized neural circuits during postnatal development.

AB  - Abstract
The basolateral amygdala receives a very dense cholinergic innervation from the basal forebrain that is important for memory consolidation. Although behavioral studies have shown that both M1 and M2 muscarinic receptors are critical for these mnemonic functions, there have been very few neuroanatomical and electrophysiological investigations of the localization and function of different types of muscarinic receptors in the amygdala. In the present study we investigated the subcellular localization of M2 muscarinic receptors (M2Rs) in the anterior basolateral nucleus (BLa) of the mouse, including the localization of M2Rs in parvalbumin (PV) immunoreactive interneurons, using double-labeling immunoelectron microscopy. Little if any M2R-immunoreactivity (M2R-ir) was observed in neuronal somata, but the neuropil was densely labeled. Ultrastructural analysis using a pre-embedding immunogold-silver technique (IGS) demonstrated M2R-ir in dendritic shafts, spines, and axon terminals forming asymmetrical (excitatory) or symmetrical (mostly inhibitory) synapses. In addition, about one-quarter of PV+ axon terminals and half of PV+ dendrites, localized using immunoperoxidase, were M2R+ when observed in single thin sections. In all M2R+ neuropilar structures, including those that were PV+, about one-quarter to two-thirds of M2R+ immunoparticles were plasma-membrane-associated, depending on the structure. The expression of M2Rs in PV+ and PV-negative terminals forming symmetrical synapses indicates M2R modulation of inhibitory transmission. Electrophysiological studies in mouse and rat brain slices, including paired recordings from interneurons and pyramidal projection neurons, demonstrated M2R-mediated suppression of GABA release. These findings suggest cell-type-specific functions of M2Rs and shed light on organizing principles of cholinergic modulation in the BLa.

AB  - Abstract
The response to a traumatic experience may be rapid recovery or development of psychopathology such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Impaired extinction of fear memories is thought to contribute to the development of the persistent trauma memories and avoidance.

The Wnt/β-catenin pathway and the endocannabinoid system appear to play significant roles in anxiety and depressive symptoms. Here we examined the involvement of β-catenin in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in extinction in rats exposed to the shock and reminders model of PTSD.

We found that increased β-catenin levels in the NAc were correlated with facilitated extinction kinetics in rats exposed to shock and reminders, suggesting that increased levels of NAc β-catenin are associated with a resilient response to the stressor. Furthermore, downregulating β-catenin expression in the NAc in shocked rats using sulindac (0.0178, 0.178 mg/side) impaired extinction whereas upregulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway using LiCl (2 µg/side) facilitated extinction. Exposure to shock and reminders resulted in attenuated levels of the endocannabinoid N-arachidonylethanolamine (AEA) in the NAc; the cannabinoid CB1/2 receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 (5 µg/side) microinjected into the NAc facilitated extinction in shocked rats. Importantly, the facilitating effect of WIN55,212-2 on extinction was blocked by co-administration of sulindac in doses that downregulated β-catenin levels.

Taken together, the results suggest that β-catenin in the NAc may serve as a protective buffer against the effects of severe stress, and that inhibiting this system in the NAc may prevent the therapeutic effects of cannabinoids against stress-related disorders.

AB  - Abstract
From a case study, we describe the impact of unilateral lesion of the hand area in the primary motor cortex (M1) on manual dexterity and the role of the intact contralesional M1 in long-term functional recovery. An adult macaque monkey performed two manual dexterity tasks: (i) “modified Brinkman board” task, assessed simple precision grip versus complex precision grip, the latter involved a hand postural adjustment; (ii) “modified Klüver board” task, assessed movements ranging from power grip to precision grip, pre-shaping and grasping. Two consecutive unilateral M1 lesions targeted the hand area of each hemisphere, the second lesion was performed after stable, though incomplete, functional recovery from the primary lesion. Following each lesion, the manual dexterity of the contralesional hand was affected in a comparable manner, effects being progressively more deleterious from power grip to simple and then complex precision grips. Both tasks yielded consistent data, namely that the secondary M1 lesion did not have a significant impact on the recovered performance from the primary M1 lesion, which took place 5 months earlier. In conclusion, the intact contralesional M1 did not play a major role in the long-term functional recovery from a primary M1 lesion targeted to the hand area.

AB  - Abstract
Newly formed ectopic hair-cell-like cells (EHCLCs) induced by overexpression of atonal homolog 1 (Atoh1) in vitro were found to possess features of endogenous hair cells (HCs) in previous reports and in the present study. However, limited information is available regarding whether EHCLCs and native spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) form afferent synapses, which are important for the restoration of hearing. In the current study, we focused on the afferent synaptogenesis between EHCLCs and SGN-derived dendrites. Cochlear explants of auditory epithelia with native SGNs retained were cultured in vitro, and human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) vectors encoding Atoh1 were used to overexpress Atoh1 and induce EHCLCs. We observed that the neurites of the original SGNs extended toward the lesser epithelial ridge (LER) and innervated the EHCLCs. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed the expression of presynaptic ribbon C-terminal-binding protein 2 (CtBP2) and postsynaptic density protein (PSD)-95 in the nerve endings of SGN-derived neurons adjacent to EHCLCs. PSD-95 was located directly opposite CtBP2-positive puncta in the terminals of branches of SGNs, demonstrating that the neurites of SGNs formed afferent-like synaptic connections with EHCLCs. However, the expression of glutamate receptor type 2 (GluR2) could not be detected in the terminals of branches of SGNs surrounding EHCLCs. In addition, we found that the presynaptic ribbon (CtBP2) formation in EHCLCs preceded neural innervation. Furthermore, CtBP2-positive puncta increased and then decreased in EHCLCs, similar to the changes observed in endogenous HCs in terms of their number and distribution. Our finding of the generation of cochlear afferent synapses between EHCLCs and original SGNs will lay the foundation for regenerative approaches to restoring hearing after hair cell loss.

AB  - Abstract
DiGeorge/22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11DS) is a common genetic microdeletion syndrome that underlies several neurodevelopmental disorders including autism, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia. In addition to cognitive impairments, those with 22q11DS have disrupted feeding and swallowing from birth onward. This perinatal dysphagia significantly compromises nutritional status, impairs appropriate weight gain, and can lead to life threatening aspiration-based infections. Appropriately timed excitation and inhibition of brainstem hypoglossal motor neurons, which innervate tongue muscles, is essential for proper feeding and swallowing. In this study we have examined changes in hypoglossal motor neuron function in the LgDel mouse model of 22q11DS. Hypoglossal motor neurons from LgDel mouse pups have action potentials with afterhyperpolarizations, mediated by a large conductance charybdotoxin-sensitive Ca-activated K current, that are significantly shorter in duration and greater in magnitude than those in wild-type pups. In addition, the amplitude, but not frequency, of glutamatergic excitatory glutamatergic postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) is diminished, and GABAergic, but not glycinergic, neurotransmission to hypoglossal motor neurons was reduced in LgDel animals. These observations provide a foundation for understanding the neurological changes in hypoglossal motor neuron function and their contribution to swallowing abnormalities that occur in DiGeorge/22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome.

AB  - Abstract
Diffuse traumatic brain injury (TBI) initiates secondary pathology, including inflammation and reduced myelination. Considering these injury-related pathologies, the many states of activated microglia as demonstrated by differing morphologies would form, migrate, and function in and through fields of growth-inhibitory myelin byproduct, specifically Nogo. Here we evaluate the relationship between inflammation and reduced myelin antigenicity in the wake of diffuse TBI and present the hypothesis that the Nogo-66 receptor antagonist peptide NEP(1–40) would reverse the injury-induced shift in distribution of microglia morphologies by limiting myelin-based inhibition. Adult male rats were subjected to midline fluid percussion sham or brain injury. At 2 h, 6 h, 1 d, 2 d, 7 d, and 21 d post-injury, immunohistochemical staining was analyzed in sensory cortex (S1BF) for myelin antigens (myelin basic protein; MBP and CNPase), microglia morphology (ionized calcium-binding adapter protein; Iba1), Nogo receptor and Nogo. Pronounced reduction in myelin antigenicity was evident transiently at 1 d post-injury, as evidenced by decreased MBP and CNPase staining, as well as loss of white matter organization, compared to sham and later injury time points. Concomitant with reduced myelin antigenicity, injury shifted microglia morphology from the predominantly ramified morphology observed in sham-injured cortex to hyper-ramified, activated, fully activated, or rod. Changes in microglial morphology were evident as early as 2 h post-injury, and remained at least until day 21. Additional cohorts of uninjured and brain-injured animals received vehicle or drug (NEP(1–40), i.p., 15 min and 19 h post-injury) and brains were collected at 2 h, 6 h, 1 d, 2 d, or 7 d post-injury. NEP(1–40) administration further shifted distributions of microglia away from an injury-induced activated morphology toward greater proportions of rod and macrophage-like morphologies compared to vehicle-treated. By 7 d post-injury, no differences in the distributions of microglia were noted between vehicle and NEP(1–40). This study begins to link secondary pathologies of white matter damage and inflammation after diffuse TBI. In the injured brain, secondary pathologies co-occur and likely interact, with consequences for neuronal circuit disruption leading to neurological symptoms.

AB  - Abstract
Many neuropsychiatric disorders show localized dysfunction in specific cortical regions. The mechanisms underlying such region-specific vulnerabilities are unknown. Post-mortem analyses have demonstrated a selective reduction in the expression of parvalbumin (PV) in GABAergic interneurons in the frontal rather than the sensory cortex of patients with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and bipolar disorders. PV neurons are surrounded by perineuronal nets (PNNs), and are protected from oxidative stress. Previous studies have shown that the characteristics of PNNs are brain region-specific. Therefore, we hypothesized that PV neurons and PNNs may be targeted in region-specific lesions in the brain. Oxidative stress was induced in mice by rearing them in socially isolated conditions. We systemically examined the distribution of PV neurons and PNNs in the brains of these mice as well as a control group. Our results show that the regions frequently affected in neuropsychiatric disorders show significantly lower PV expression and a lower percentage of PV neurons surrounded by PNNs in the brains of socially isolated mice. These results indicate that PV neurons and PNNs exhibit region-specific vulnerabilities. Our findings may be useful for elucidating the mechanisms underlying region-specific disruption of the brain in neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Abstract
The nucleus accumbens (NAcc) is a forebrain region that may significantly contribute to the integration of taste and visceral signals during food consumption. Changes in dopamine release in the NAcc have been observed during consumption of a sweet taste and during compulsive consumption of dietary sugars, suggesting that NAcc dopaminergic transmission is strongly correlated with taste familiarity and the hedonic value content. NAcc core and shell nuclei are differentially involved during and after sugar exposure and, particularly, previous evidence suggests that dopamine D2 receptors could be related with the strength of the latent inhibition (LI) of conditioned taste aversion (CTA), which depends on the length of the taste stimulus pre-exposure. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate, after long-term exposure to sugar, the function of dopaminergic D2 receptors in the NAcc core during taste memory retrieval preference test, and during CTA. Adult rats were exposed during 14 days to 10% sugar solution as a single liquid ad libitum. NAcc core bilateral injections of D2 dopamine receptor antagonist, haloperidol (1 μg/μL), were made before third preference test and CTA acquisition. We found that sugar was similarly preferred after 3 acute presentations or 14 days of continued sugar consumption and that haloperidol did not disrupt this appetitive memory retrieval. Nevertheless, D2 receptors antagonism differentially affects aversive memory formation after acute or long-term sugar consumption. These results demonstrate that NAcc dopamine D2 receptors have a differential function during CTA depending on the degree of sugar familiarity.

AB  - Abstract
The injection of safe doses of botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) have been reported to be useful for the treatment of neuropathic pain, but it is still unknown how functional recovery is induced after peripheral nerve injury. We evaluated the effects of intranerve application of BoNT/A, on regeneration and sensorimotor functional recovery in partial and complete peripheral nerve injuries in the mouse. After sciatic nerve crush (SNC) and intranerve delivery of BoNT/A (15 pg), axonal regeneration was measured by nerve pinch test at different days. Regeneration of myelinated and unmyelinated fibers was assessed by immunohistochemical double labeling for NF200/GAP43 and CGRP/GAP43. S100 was used as Schwann cells marker. Medial footpad skin reinnervation was assessed by PGP staining. Motor functions were assessed by means of nerve conduction tests. In other mice groups, nerve conduction tests were performed also after chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve and intraplantar injection of BoNT/A (15 pg). In SNC mice, BoNT/A increased the rate of axonal regeneration. The advantage of regrowing myelinated axons after BoNT/A injection was evidenced by longer NF200+ nerve profiles and confirmed by nerve histology. We observed also a higher expression of S100 in the distal portion of BoNT/A-injected regenerated nerves. In CCI mice, BoNT/A induced an increase in reinnervation of gastrocnemius and plantar muscles. These results show that a low dose of BoNT/A, insufficient to produce muscular dysfunction, conversely speeds up sensorimotor recovery by stimulating myelinated axonal regeneration, and points out its application as a multipotent treatment for peripheral neuropathies.

AB  - Abstract
Neuro-anatomical evidence supports the potential for threat-related factors, such as fear, anxiety and vigilance, to influence brainstem motor nuclei controlling eye movements, as well as the vestibular nuclei. However, little is known about how threat influences human ocular responses, such as eye saccades (ES), smooth pursuit eye tracking (SP), and optokinetic nystagmus (OKN), and whether these responses can be facilitated above normal baseline levels with a natural source of threat. This study was designed to examine the effects of height-induced postural threat on the gain of ES, SP and OKN responses in humans. Twenty participants stood at two different surface heights while performing ES (ranging from 8° to 45° from center), SP (15, 20, 30°/s) and OKN (15, 30, 60°/s) responses in the horizontal plane. Height did not significantly increase the slope of the relationship between ES peak velocity and initial amplitude, or the gain of ES amplitude. In contrast height significantly increased SP and OKN gain. Significant correlations were found between changes in physiological arousal and OKN gain. Observations of changes with height in OKN and SP support neuro-anatomical evidence of threat-related mechanisms influencing both oculo-motor nuclei and vestibular reflex pathways. Although further study is warranted, the findings suggest that potential influences of fear, anxiety and arousal/alertness should be accounted for, or controlled, during clinical vestibular and oculo-motor testing.

AB  - Abstract
Despite the numerous benefits of microwave applications in our daily life, microwaves were associated with diverse neurological complaints such as headaches and impaired sleep patterns, and changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG). To which extent microwaves influence the brain function remains unclear. This exploratory study assessed the behavior and neurochemistry in mice immediately or 4 weeks after a 6-day exposure to low-intensity 10-GHz microwaves with an amplitude modulation (AM) of 2 or 8 Hz. These modulation frequencies of 2 and 8 Hz are situated within the delta and theta-alpha frequency bands in the EEG spectrum and are associated with sleep and active behavior, respectively. During these experiments, the specific absorbance rate was 0.3 W/kg increasing the brain temperature with 0.23 °C. For the first time, exposing mice to 8-Hz AM significantly reduced locomotor activity in an open field immediately after exposure which normalized after 4 weeks. This in contrast to 2-Hz AM which didn’t induce significant changes in locomotor activity immediately and 4 weeks after exposure. Despite this difference in motor behavior, no significant changes in striatal dopamine (DA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels and DOPAC/DA turnover nor in cortical glutamate (GLU) concentrations were detected. In all cases, no effects on motor coordination on a rotarod, spatial working memory, anxiety nor depressive-like behavior were observed. The outcome of this study indicates that exposing mice to low-intensity 8-Hz AM microwaves can alter the locomotor activity in contrast to 2-Hz AM which did not affect the tested behaviors.

AB  - Abstract
New therapeutics to manage post-surgical pain are needed to mitigate the liabilities of opioid and other analgesics. Our previous work shows that key modulators of excitability in peripheral nociceptors, such as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) are inhibited by activation of adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK). We hypothesized that AMPK activation would attenuate acute incision-evoked mechanical hypersensitivity and the development of hyperalgesic priming caused by surgery in mice. Here we have used a variety of administration routes and combinations of AMPK activators to test this hypothesis. Topical administration of a resveratrol-based cream inhibited acute mechanical hypersensitivity evoked by incision and blocked the development of hyperalgesic priming. We also observed that systemic administration of metformin dose-dependently inhibited incision-evoked mechanical hypersensitivity and hyperalgesic priming. Interestingly, low doses of systemic metformin and local resveratrol that had no acute effect were able to mitigate development of hyperalgesic priming. Combined treatment with doses of systemic metformin and local resveratrol that were not effective on their own enhanced the acute efficacy of the individual AMPK activators for post-surgical mechanical pain alleviation and blocked the development of hyperalgesic priming. Finally, we used dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in culture to show that resveratrol and metformin given in combination shift the concentration–response curve for AMPK activation to the left and increase the magnitude of AMPK activation. Therefore, we find that topical administration is an effective treatment route of administration and combining systemic and local treatments led to anti-nociceptive efficacy in acute mechanical hypersensitivity at doses that were not effective alone. Collectively our work demonstrates a specific effect of AMPK activators on post-surgical pain and points to novel therapeutic opportunities with potential immediate impact in the clinical setting.

AB  - Abstract
Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is the predominant water channel in mammalian CNS where it is localized at the perivascular astrocytic foot processes abutting brain microvessels. Several lines of evidence suggest that AQP4 is involved in important homeostatic functions and that mislocalization of the perivascular pool of AQP4 is implicated in several different brain disorders. A recent study suggests that the differential susceptibility of midbrain dopaminergic neurons to the parkinsonogenic toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) depends on the expression of AQP4. Further, MRI studies of patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) point to an excessive water accumulation in the substantia nigra (SN). This prompted us to investigate the cellular and subcellular distribution of AQP4 in mouse SN using immunofluorescence and quantitative immunogold cytochemistry. Compared with neocortex, SN exhibits a higher concentration of AQP4. Specifically, judged by electron microscopic immunogold analysis, the perivascular density of AQP4 in SN exceeds by 70% the perivascular density of AQP4 in the neocortex. An even larger difference in AQP4 labeling was found for astrocytic processes in the neuropil. Treatment with MPTP further increased (by &gt;30%) the perivascular AQP4 density in SN, but also increased AQP4 labeling in the neocortex. Our data indicate that the perivascular AQP4 pool in SN is high in normal animals and even higher after treatment with MPTP. This would leave the SN more prone to water accumulation and supports the idea that AQP4 could be involved in the pathogenesis of PD.

AB  - Abstract
One of the long-standing issues in neurolinguistic research is about the neural basis of word representation, concerning whether grammatical classification or semantic difference causes the neural dissociation of brain activity patterns when processing different word categories, especially nouns and verbs. To disentangle this puzzle, four orthogonalized word categories in Chinese: unambiguous nouns (UN), unambiguous verbs (UV), ambiguous words with noun-biased semantics (AN), and ambiguous words with verb-biased semantics (AV) were adopted in an auditory task for recording electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from 128 electrodes on the scalps of twenty-two subjects. With the advanced current density reconstruction (CDR) algorithm and the constraint of standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography, the spatiotemporal brain dynamics of word processing were explored with the results that in multiple time periods including P1 (60–90 ms), N1 (100–140 ms), P200 (150–250 ms) and N400 (350–450 ms), noun–verb dissociation over the parietal-occipital and frontal-central cortices appeared not only between the UN-UV grammatical classes but also between the grammatically identical but semantically different AN-AV pairs. The apparent semantic dissociation within one grammatical class strongly suggests that the semantic difference rather than grammatical classification could be interpreted as the origin of the noun–verb neural dissociation. Our results also revealed that semantic dissociation occurs from an early stage and repeats in multiple phases, thus supporting a functionally hierarchical word processing mechanism.

AB  - Abstract
Recently, alternative drug therapies for Parkinson’s disease (PD) have been investigated as there are many shortcomings of traditional dopamine-based therapies including difficulties in treating cognitive and attentional dysfunction. A promising therapeutic avenue is to target mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in PD. One option might be the use of methylene blue (MB), an antioxidant and metabolic enhancer. MB has been shown to improve cognitive function in both intact rodents and rodent disease models. Therefore, we investigated whether MB might treat attentional deficits in a rat model of PD induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). MB also has neuroprotective capabilities against neurotoxic insult, so we also assessed the ability of MB to provide neuroprotection in our PD model. The results show that MB could preserve some dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra par compacta when 6-OHDA was infused into the medial forebrain bundle. This neuroprotection did not yield a significant behavioral improvement when motor functions were measured. However, MB significantly improved attentional performance in the five-choice task designed to measure selective and sustained attention. In conclusion, MB might be useful in improving some attentional function and preserving dopaminergic cells in this model. Future work should continue to study and optimize the abilities of MB for the treatment of PD.

AB  - Abstract
The superior temporal gyrus (STG) is involved in speech recognition against informational masking under cocktail-party-listening conditions. Compared to healthy listeners, people with schizophrenia perform worse in speech recognition under informational speech-on-speech masking conditions. It is not clear whether the schizophrenia-related vulnerability to informational masking is associated with certain changes in FC of the STG with some critical brain regions. Using sparse-sampling fMRI design, this study investigated the differences between people with schizophrenia and healthy controls in FC of the STG for target-speech listening against informational speech-on-speech masking, when a listening condition with either perceived spatial separation (PSS, with a spatial release of informational masking) or perceived spatial co-location (PSC, without the spatial release) between target speech and masking speech was introduced. The results showed that in healthy participants, but not participants with schizophrenia, the contrast of either the PSS or PSC condition against the masker-only condition induced an enhancement of functional connectivity (FC) of the STG with the left superior parietal lobule and the right precuneus. Compared to healthy participants, participants with schizophrenia showed declined FC of the STG with the bilateral precuneus, right SPL, and right supplementary motor area. Thus, FC of the STG with the parietal areas is normally involved in speech listening against informational masking under either the PSS or PSC conditions, and declined FC of the STG in people with schizophrenia with the parietal areas may be associated with the increased vulnerability to informational masking.

AB  - Abstract
Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons receive peripheral somatosensory information and send orderly projections to second-order relay nuclei in the spinal cord and in the brainstem. Atypical cadherin Celsr3 is known to play a critical role in wiring of several central and peripheral axons. Although Celsr3 mRNA is heavily expressed in DRG neurons, its role in the development of somatosensory projections remains unexplored. Here we assessed the role of Celsr3 in DRG using conditional gene inactivation in crosses with Wnt1-Cre mice. Using Celsr3-GFP transgenic mice, we found that Celsr3 was highly expressed in different DRG cells, such as Pavalbumin-, TrkB-, and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-positive neurons. Wnt1-Cre;Celsr3f/− animals survived for a few weeks and looked smaller than littermate controls. DiI tracing showed that early DRG axons entered the spinal cord and reached spinal cord targets similarly in mutant and control mice. CGRP-positive fiber density was significantly decreased in lamina I in the mutant versus control spinal cord at postnatal day (P) 7 and P14. Furthermore, more Pavalbumin-positive fibers invaded the gray matter and made more contacts with spinal motor neurons in mutant than in control samples. Behavioral analysis showed that mutant animals were less sensitive to pain and more sensitive to mechanical stimulation than controls. In conclusion, Celsr3 is dispensable for the patterning of central DRG projections, but it regulates for the fine mapping of sensory fibers in the gray matter, which is important for somatosensory processing.

Skilled performance and acquisition is dependent upon afferent input to motor cortex. The present study used short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) to probe how manipulation of sensory afference by attention affects different circuits projecting to pyramidal tract neurons in motor cortex. SAI was assessed in the first dorsal interosseous muscle while participants performed a low or high attention-demanding visual detection task. SAI was evoked by preceding a suprathreshold transcranial magnetic stimulus with electrical stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist. To isolate different afferent intracortical circuits in motor cortex SAI was evoked using either posterior–anterior (PA) or anterior–posterior (PA) monophasic current. In an independent sample, somatosensory processing during the same attention-demanding visual detection tasks was assessed using somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEP) elicited by median nerve stimulation. SAI elicited by AP TMS was reduced under high compared to low visual attention demands. SAI elicited by PA TMS was not affected by visual attention demands. SEPs revealed that the high visual attention load reduced the fronto-central P20-N30 but not the contralateral parietal N20-P25 SEP component. P20-N30 reduction confirmed that the visual attention task altered sensory afference. The current results offer further support that PA and AP TMS recruit different neuronal circuits. AP circuits may be one substrate by which cognitive strategies shape sensorimotor processing during skilled movement by altering sensory processing in premotor areas.

AB  - Abstract
Aberrations in intracellular calcium (Ca2+) have been well established within amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a severe motor neuron disease. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration is controlled in part through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) mitochondria Ca2+ cycle (ERMCC). The ER supplies Ca2+ to the mitochondria at close contacts between the two organelles, i.e. the mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs). The Sigma 1 receptor (Sig1R) is enriched at MAMs, where it acts as an inter-organelle signaling modulator. However, its impact on intracellular Ca2+ at the cellular level remains to be thoroughly investigated.

Here, we used cultured embryonic mice spinal neurons to investigate the influence of Sig1R activation on intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis in the presence of G93AhSOD1 (G93A), an established ALS-causing mutation. Sig1R expression was increased in G93A motor neurons relative to non-transgenic (nontg) controls. Furthermore, we demonstrated significantly reduced bradykinin-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores in G93A spinal neurons, which were normalized by the Sig1R agonist SA4503. Moreover, SA4503 accelerated cytosolic Ca2+ clearance following a) AMPAR activation by kainate and b) IP3R–mediated ER Ca2+ release following bradykinin stimulation in both genotypes. PRE-084 (another Sig1R agonist) did not exert any significant effects on cytosolic Ca2+. Both Sig1R expression and functionality were altered by the G93A mutation, indicating the centrality of Sig1R in ALS pathology. Here, we showed that intracellular Ca2+ shuttling can be manipulated by Sig1R activation, thus demonstrating the value of using the pharmacological manipulation of Sig1R to understand Ca2+ homeostasis.

AB  - Abstract
Gut microbiota interventions, including probiotic and prebiotic use can alter behavior in adult animals and healthy volunteers. However, little is known about their effects in younger individuals. To investigate this, male Sprague–Dawley rats (post-natal day 21, PND21) received Lactobacillus casei 54-2-33 (104 cfu/ml), inulin as prebiotic (16 mg/ml), or both together (synbiotic) via drinking water for 14 days. Control rats received water alone. Open field (OF) and elevated plus maze (EPM) behaviors were evaluated at PND34 and 35, respectively. 30 min after EPM, brains and trunk blood were collected to evaluate hippocampal 5-HT1A (mRNA and protein) and plasma corticosterone (CORT). Lactobacillus, inulin and synbiotic-treated rats had fewer entries to the OF’s center and spent more time in its periphery than controls. Synbiotic-fed rats explored the EPM’s open arms longer than probiotic and inulin-fed rats. Synbiotic, but not Lactobacillus nor inulin-fed rats had lower levels of EPM-evoked CORT than controls. Basal CORT levels, evaluated in a naïve cohort, were higher in Lactobacillus- and inulin-fed rats than controls. In naïve synbiotic-fed rats, 5-HT1A mRNA levels were higher in dentate gyrus and cornus ammonis 1 layer (CA1), than in all other naïve groups, while hippocampal 5-HT1A protein levels were lower in bacteria-fed rats than controls. 5-HT1A mRNA changes suggest complex effects of gut microbes on hippocampal gene expression machinery, probably involving endogenous/exogenous bacteria and prebiotics interactions. Importantly, age might also influence their behavioral outcomes. Together, these data suggest that interventions in young rat microbiota evoke early behavioral changes upon stress, apparently in a hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis independent fashion.

AB  - Abstract
The plasticity of nervous systems allows animals to quickly adapt to a changing environment. In particular, seasonal plasticity of brain structure and behavior is often critical to survival or mating in seasonal climates. Songbirds provide striking examples of seasonal changes in neural circuits and vocal behavior and have emerged as a leading model for adult brain plasticity. While seasonal plasticity and the well-characterized process of juvenile song learning may share common neural mechanisms, the extent of their similarity remains unclear. Especially, it is unknown whether the basal ganglia (BG)–forebrain loop which implements song learning in juveniles by driving vocal exploration participates in seasonal plasticity. To address this issue, we performed bilateral lesions of the output structure of the song-related BG–forebrain circuit (the magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium) in canaries during the breeding season, when song is most stereotyped, and just after resuming singing in early fall, when canaries sing their most variable songs and may produce new syllable types. Lesions drastically reduced song acoustic variability, increased song and phrase duration, and decreased syntax variability in early fall, reverting at least partially seasonal changes observed between the breeding season and early fall. On the contrary, lesions did not affect singing behavior during the breeding season. Our results therefore indicate that the BG–forebrain pathway introduces acoustic and syntactic variability in song when canaries resume singing in early fall. We propose that BG–forebrain circuits actively participate in seasonal plasticity by injecting variability in behavior during non-breeding season.
Significance Statement
The study of seasonal plasticity in temperate songbirds has provided important insights into the mechanisms of structural and functional plasticity in the central nervous system. The precise function and mechanisms of seasonal song plasticity however remain poorly understood. We show here that a basal ganglia–forebrain circuit involved in the acquisition and maintenance of birdsong is actively inducing song variability outside the breeding season, when singing is most variable, while having little effect on the stereotyped singing during the breeding season. Our results suggest that seasonal plasticity reflects an active song-maintenance process akin to juvenile learning, and that basal ganglia–forebrain circuits can drive plasticity in a learned vocal behavior during the non–injury-induced degeneration and reconstruction of the neural circuit underlying its production.

AB  - Abstract
Locomotor networks after spinal cord injury (SCI) are shaped by training-activated proprioceptive and cutaneous inputs. Nociception from injured tissues may alter these changes but has largely been overlooked. The objective of the present study was to ascertain whether lumbar muscle inflammation hinders locomotion recovery in a mouse model of complete SCI. Lower limb kinematics during treadmill training was assessed before and after complete SCI at T8 (2, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days post-injury). Locomotor recovery was compared in 4 groups of CD1 mice: control spinal mice; spinal mice with daily locomotor training; spinal mice with lumbar muscle inflammation (Complete Freund’s Adjuvant (CFA) injection); and spinal mice with locomotor training and CFA. On day 28, H-reflex excitability and its inhibition at high-frequency stimulation (frequency-dependent depression: FDD) were compared between groups, all of which showed locomotor recovery. Recovery was enhanced by training, whereas lumbar muscle inflammation hindered these effects (knee angular excursion and paw drag: p’s &lt; 0.05). In addition, lumbar muscle inflammation impaired hind limb coupling during locomotion (p &lt; 0.05) throughout recovery. Also, H-reflex disinhibition was prevented by training, with or without CFA injection (p’s &lt; 0.05). Altogether, these results indicate that back muscle inflammation modulates spinally mediated locomotor recovery in mice with complete SCI, in part, by reducing adaptive changes induced by training.

AB  - Abstract
The loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons and the resulting dopamine (DA) depletion in the striatum (STR) lead to altered neuronal activity and enhanced beta activity in various regions of the basal ganglia (BG) motor loop in patients with Parkinson’s disease and in rodents in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rat model. Intrastriatal DA graft implantation has been shown to re-innervate the host brain and restore DA input.

Here, DA cell grafts were implanted into the STR of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats and the effect on neuronal activity under urethane anesthesia (1.4 g/kg, injected intraperitoneally) was tested in the entopeduncular nucleus (EPN, the equivalent to the human globus pallidus internus), the output nucleus of the BG, and the globus pallidus (GP, the equivalent to the human globus pallidus externus), a key region in the indirect pathway.

In animals, which were transplanted with cells derived from the ventral mesencephalon of embryonic day 12 rat embryos into the STR, the rotational behavior induced by DA agonists in 6-OHDA-lesioned rats was significantly improved. This was accompanied by alleviated EPN firing rate and reinstated patterns of neuronal activity in the GP and EPN. Analysis of oscillatory activity revealed enhanced beta activity in both regions, which was reduced after grafting.

In summary these data indicate restoration of BG motor loop toward normal activity by DA graft integration.

AB  - Abstract
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) promotes gonadotropin secretion by regulating the activity of neurons that release gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in the hypothalamus. However, the mechanisms of action of PGE2 at these neurons have yet to be fully explored. We examined the effects of PGE2 on the generation of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) at GnRH neurons as measured by whole-cell, patch-clamp recordings. GnRH neurons were identified in slices prepared from the preoptic areas of female GnRH-EGFP rats. Exposure to PGE2 significantly increased the frequency, but not the amplitude, of the mEPSCs generated on the day of proestrus, but neither frequency nor amplitude was altered on day 1 of diestrus. These data suggest that the action of PGE2 on mEPSC frequency varies depending on the stage of estrous. An estrogen-dependence of PGE2’s action was further supported by the increased frequency, but not amplitude, of mEPSCs generated at GnRH neurons prepared from estrogen-primed ovariectomized rats. Conversely, PGE2 had no effect on mEPSC frequency or amplitude at GnRH neurons in cholesterol-treated rats. Subsequent experiments to identify candidate receptors for PG2E’s action revealed that exposure to a PGE2 receptor 4 (EP4) agonist, but not EP1 or EP2 agonists, mimicked the effects achieved by PGE2 exposure. These effects of mEPSCs could be reversed using an EP4 antagonist, illustrating the specificity of the effect. Collectively, these data demonstrate that PGE2 can alter excitatory synaptic neurotransmission at GnRH neurons via EP4 signaling at presynaptic site(s) in an estrogen-dependent fashion during proestrus.

AB  - Abstract
Adolescence is accompanied by the maturation of several stress-responsive areas of the brain including the amygdala, a key region for the acquisition and expression of conditioned fear. These changes may contribute to the development of stress-related disorders in adolescence, such as anxiety and depression, and increase the susceptibility to these psychopathologies later in life. Here, we assessed the effects of acute restraint stress on fear learning and amygdala activation in pre-adolescent and adult male rats. Pre-adolescents exposed to stress prior to fear conditioning showed greater resistance to the extinction of fear memories than adults. At the cellular level, the combination of stress and fear conditioning resulted in a greater number of FOS-positive cells in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) than fear conditioning alone, and this increase was greater in pre-adolescents than in adults. Despite age-dependent differences, we found no changes in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) levels in the amygdala of either pre-adolescent or adult males. Overall, our data indicate that stress prior to fear conditioning leads to extinction-resistant fear responses in pre-adolescent animals, and that the BLA may be one neural locus mediating these age-dependent effects of stress on fear learning.

AB  - Abstract
Prenatal hypoxia induced by transient intrauterine ischemia is a serious clinical problem, and at present, effective treatments are lacking. Currently, it is unknown how prenatal hypoxia affects behaviors in adulthood. Therefore, we developed a mouse model that mimics prenatal hypoxia in humans using uterine artery occlusion in late gestation. We examined whether prenatal hypoxia induces behavioral changes in adult male and female offspring by conducting a series of behavioral tests. In adulthood, longer immobility was observed in the forced swim test in males, whereas females showed decreased inhibition in the prepulse inhibition test. We then investigated the effects of two different selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), fluoxetine (FLX) and escitalopram (ESC), on these behavioral changes. These drugs affect the neurodevelopmental process and have long-term neurological consequences. FLX treatment from postnatal day 3 (P3) to P21 ameliorated the behavioral changes in both male and female mice. In comparison, ESC treatment ameliorated the behavioral changes only in female mice. Neurochemical analysis revealed that dopamine was increased in the female hippocampus, but not in males. Thus, neonatal SSRI treatment decreases dopamine levels in the hippocampus in females selectively. Our findings suggest that prenatal hypoxia is a risk factor for behavioral abnormalities in adulthood, and that neonatal SSRI treatment might have clinical potential for alleviating these long-term behavioral deficits.

AB  - Abstract
Past research indicates that female meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) show decreased neurogenesis within the hippocampus during the breeding season relative to the non-breeding season, whereas male voles show no such seasonal changes. We expanded upon these results by quantifying a variety of endogenous cell proliferation and neurogenesis markers in wild-caught voles. Adult male and female voles were captured in the summer (breeding season) or fall (non-breeding season), and blood samples and brain tissue were collected. Four cellular markers (pHisH3, Ki67, DCX, and pyknosis) were labeled and then quantified using either fluorescent or light microscopy. The volume of the cell layers within the dentate gyrus (hilus and granule cell layer) was significantly larger in males than in females. In both sexes, all the cellular markers decreased significantly in the dentate gyrus during the breeding season relative to the non-breeding season, indicating decreased cell proliferation, neurogenesis, and pyknosis. Only the pHisH3 marker showed a sex difference, with females having a greater density of this cell proliferation marker than males. During the breeding season relative to the non-breeding season, males and females showed the predicted significant increases in testosterone and estradiol, respectively. Overall, these results suggest higher levels of neuronal turn-over during the non-breeding season relative to the breeding season, possibly due to seasonal changes in sex steroids.

AB  - Abstract
Although often examined in isolation, a single neuromodulator typically has multiple cellular and synaptic effects. Here, we have examined the interaction of the cellular and synaptic effects of 5-HT in the lamprey spinal cord.

5-HT reduces the amplitude of glutamatergic synaptic inputs and the slow post-spike afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) in motor neurons. We examined the interaction between these effects using ventral root activity evoked by stimulation of the spinal cord. While 5-HT reduced excitatory glutamatergic synaptic inputs in motor neurons to approximately 60% of control, ventral root activity was not significantly affected. The reduction of the sAHP by 5-HT increased motor neuron excitability by reducing spike frequency adaptation, an effect that could in principle have opposed the reduction of the excitatory synaptic input. Support for this was sought by reducing the amplitude of the sAHP by applying the toxin apamin before 5-HT application. In these experiments, 5-HT reduced the ventral root response, presumably because the reduction of the synaptic input now dominated. This was supported by computer simulations that showed that the motor output could be maintained over a wide range of synaptic input values if they were matched by changes in postsynaptic excitability. The effects of 5-HT on ventral root responses were altered by spinal cord lesions: 5-HT significantly increased ventral root responses in animals that recovered good locomotor function, consistent with a lesion-induced reduction in the synaptic effects of 5-HT, which thus biases its effects to the increase in motor neuron excitability.

AB  - Abstract
Procrastination is a prevalent problematic behavior that brings serious consequences, such as lower levels of health, wealth, and well-being. Previous research has verified that impulsivity is one of the traits most strongly correlated with procrastination. However, little is known about why there is a tight behavioral relationship between them. To address this question, we used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to explore the common neural substrates between procrastination and impulsivity. In line with previous findings, the behavioral results showed a strong behavioral correlation between procrastination and impulsivity. Neuroimaging results showed impulsivity and procrastination shared the common neurobiological underpinnings in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) based on the data from 85 participants (sample 1). Furthermore, the mediation analysis revealed that impulsivity mediated the impact of gray matter (GM) volumes of this overlapping region in the DLPFC on procrastination on another independent 84 participants’ data (sample 2). In conclusion, the overlapping brain region in the DLPFC would be responsible for the close relationship between procrastination and impulsivity. As a whole, the present study extends our knowledge on procrastination, and provides a novel perspective to explain the tight impulsivity – procrastination relationship.

AB  - Abstract
The mode of action of L-DOPA on excitatory synaptic transmission in second-order neurons of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) was studied using the rat brainstem slices. Superfusion of L-DOPA (10 μM) reduced the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) without any effect on the amplitude. A low concentration (1 μM) was ineffective on the mEPSCs, and the highest concentration (100 μM) exerted a stronger inhibitory effect. L-DOPA (10 μM) decreased the amplitude of EPSCs (eEPSCs) evoked by electrical stimulation of the tractus solitarius and increased the paired-pulse ratio. The inhibitory effects of L-DOPA on mEPSCs and eEPSCs were similar to those of dopamine (100 μM). The effects of L-DOPA were blocked by a competitive antagonist, L-DOPA methyl ester (100 μM) and also by a D2 receptor antagonist, sulpiride (10 μM), while those of dopamine were blocked by the latter but not by the former. In reserpine (5 mg/kg, s.c.)-treated rats, the effects of L-DOPA on both mEPSCs and eEPSCs were completely abolished, but those of dopamine remained unchanged. The present results suggest a possibility that L-DOPA may induce the release of dopamine from the axon terminals in the NTS and the released dopamine suppresses the glutamatergic transmission through activation of the presynaptic D2 receptors.

This study aimed to determine the effect of exercise on locomotion, anxiety-related behavior, learning, and memory in socially isolated post-weaning rats, as well as the correlation between exercise and the concentration of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in the hippocampus. Rats were randomly assigned to three groups: the control group; the social isolation group; the social isolation plus exercise (SIE) group. Social isolation conditions, with or without exercise were maintained for 90 d, and then multiple behavioral tests, including the open-field test, elevated plus maze test, and Morris water maze (MWM) test were administered. Following behavioral assessment, hippocampal tissue samples were obtained for measurement of BDNF and NGF. There wasn’t a significant difference in locomotor activity between the groups (P &gt; 0.05). Anxiety scores were higher in the socially isolated group (P &lt; 0.05) than in the SIE group (P &lt; 0.05). According to the probe trial session of the MWM test results, exercise training improved platform crossings’ number in the socially isolated rats (P &lt; 0.05). Exercise training ameliorated social isolation-induced reduction in hippocampal BDNF and NGF content (P &lt; 0.05). These findings suggest that exercise training improves cognitive functions via increasing hippocampal BDNF and NGF concentrations in socially isolated post-weaning rats.

AB  - Abstract
Amyloid β (Aβ) is a pathogenic peptide associated with many neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson's disease. The retinal inflammation in response to Aβ is implicated in the pathogenesis of several ocular diseases including age-related macular degeneration, Alzheimer's-related optic neuropathy and glaucoma. In the present study, we found that a single intravitreal injection of oligomeric Aβ1-40 in mouse activated the NLRP3 inflammasome and the NF-κB signaling, induced the production of inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α and IL-6. In addition, Aβ1-40 caused retinal function impairment while no noticeable morphological changes were observed under light microscope. Furthermore, immunohistochemical results showed that Aβ1-40 enhanced the number of Iba1-positive cells in the inner retina. The mRNA expressions of LXRα and LXRβ decreased in the neuroretina of the Aβ1-40-injected mice. No significant difference was found on the protein expressions of LXRs and ABCA1 in both neuroretina and RPE/choroid complex between the Aβ1-40-injected group and the control group. A synthetic LXR ligand, TO901317 (TO90), enhanced the expressions of LXRα and ABCA1 at both mRNA and protein levels in the Aβ1-40-injected mice, while the LXRβ expression was unchanged. TO90 preserved ERG a- and b-wave amplitudes and reduced the number of Iba1-positive cells in the Aβ1-40-treated retina. Furthermore, TO90 down-regulated the mRNA levels of TNF-α and IL-6, as well as the expressions of p-IκBα, NLRP3, caspase-1 and IL-1β in the Aβ1-40-injected animals. We suggest that activation of LXRα and its target gene ABCA1 exerts potent anti-inflammatory effect on the Aβ-treated retina.

AB  - Abstract
Following a Pavlovian pairing procedure, alcohol-paired cues come to elicit behavioral responses that lead to alcohol consumption. Here we used an optogenetic approach to activate basolateral amygdala (BLA) axonal terminals targeting the shell of nucleus accumbens (AcbSh) and investigated a possible influence over cue-conditioned alcohol seeking and alcohol drinking, based on the demonstrated roles of these areas in behavioral responding to Pavlovian cues and in feeding behavior. Rats were trained to anticipate alcohol or sucrose following the onset of a discrete conditioned stimulus (CS). Channelrhodopsin-mediated activation of the BLA-to-AcbSh pathway concurrent with each CS disrupted cued alcohol seeking. Activation of the same pathway caused rapid cessation of alcohol drinking from a sipper tube. Neither effect was accompanied by an overall change in locomotion. Finally, the suppressive effect of photoactivation on cued-triggered seeking was also evidenced in animals trained with sucrose. Together these findings suggest that photoactivation of BLA terminals in the AcbSh can override the conditioned motivational properties of reward-predictive cues as well as unconditioned consummatory responses necessary for alcohol drinking. The findings provide evidence for a limbic-striatal influence over motivated behavior for orally consumed rewards, including alcohol.

AB  - Abstract
In hippocampus, two guanylyl cyclases (NO-GC1 and NO-GC2) are involved in the transduction of the effects of nitric oxide (NO) on synaptic transmission. However, the respective roles of the NO-GC isoforms on synaptic transmission are less clear in other regions of the brain. In the present study, we used knock-out mice deficient for the NO-GC1 isoform (NO-GC1 KO) to analyze its role in the glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission at pyramidal neurons in layers II/III of somatosensory cortex. NO-GC1 KO slices revealed reduced frequencies of miniature excitatory- and inhibitory-postsynaptic currents, increased paired-pulse ratios and decreased input–output curves of evoked signals, which indicated the reduction of glutamate and GABA release in NO-GC1 KO mice. The functional changes in NO-GC1 KO mice were caused by the lack of cGMP as they were rescued to WT-like levels by the cGMP analog, 8-Br-PET-cGMP and conversely, mimicked by the NO-GC inhibitor, ODQ, in WT slices. In search of a cGMP target, two blockers of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels (ZD7288 and DK-AH269) reduced glutamate release in WT to the level of NO-GC1 KO mice suggesting HCN channels as possible effectors for presynaptic cGMP enhancing the glutamate release probability. By blocking postsynaptic NMDA receptors, the NMDA receptor-dependent NO signal was shown to be linked to the effect of NO-GC1 on presynaptic GABA release. Of note, the balance between glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs at individual synapses remained unaltered in the NO-GC1 KO mice. In sum, our results indicate a role for cGMP generated by presynaptic localized NO-GC1 to adjust inhibitory and excitatory inputs at individual synapses in the somatosensory cortex.

AB  - Abstract
Activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein (Arc) is implicated as a master regulator of long-term synaptic plasticity and memory formation in mammalian brain. Arc acts at synapses and within the nucleus, but the mechanisms controlling Arc localization and function are little known. As Arc transcription and translation are regulated by extracellularsignal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling, we asked whether Arc protein itself is phosphorylated by ERK. GST-fused Arc of rat origin was able to pull down endogenous ERK2 from rat hippocampal lysates. Using a peptide array, we show that ERK binds a non-canonical docking (D) motif in the C-terminal domain of Arc, and this interaction is abolished by phosphorylation of Tyr309. Activated ERK2 phosphorylated bacterially expressed Arc in vitro at all five predicted sites, as confirmed by phospho-specific protein staining and LC–MS/MS analysis. In neuroblastoma cells expressing epitope tagged-Arc, we demonstrate ERK-dependent phosphorylation of Arc in response to activation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors with carbachol. Using phosphosite-specific antibodies, this stimulus-evoked phosphorylation was shown to occur on Ser206 located within the central hinge region of Arc. In cultured hippocampal neurons expressing phosphomutant Arc under control of the activity-dependent promoter, we show that Ser206 phosphorylation regulates the nuclear:cytosolic localization of Arc. Thus, the neuronal activity-induced phosphomimic exhibits enhanced cytosolic localization relative to phosphodeficient and wild-type Arc. Furthermore, enhanced Ser206 phosphorylation of endogenous Arc was detected in the dentate gyrus cytoskeletal fraction after induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in live rats. Taken together, this work demonstrates stimulus-evoked ERK-dependent phosphorylation and regulation of Arc protein.

AB  - Abstract
Both playing a musical instrument and playing sport produce brain adaptations that might affect sensory-motor functions. While the benefits of sport practice have traditionally been attributed to aerobic fitness, it is still unknown whether playing an instrument might induce similar brain adaptations, or if a specific musical instrument like drums might be associated to specific benefits because of its high energy expenditure. Since the aerobic costs of playing drums was estimated to be comparable to those of average sport activities, we hypothesized that these two groups might show both behavioral and neurocognitive similarities. To test this hypothesis, we recruited 48 young adults and divided them into four age-matched groups: 12 drummers, 12 athletes, 12 no-drummer musicians and 12 non-athletes. Participants performed a visuo-motor discriminative response task, namely the Go/No-go, and their cortical activity was recorded by means of a 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG). Behavioral performance showed that athletes and drummers were faster than the other groups. Electrophysiological results showed that the pre-stimulus motor preparation (i.e. the Bereitschaftspotential or BP) and attentional control (i.e., the prefrontal negativity or pN), and specific post-stimulus components like the P3 and the pP2 (reflecting the stimulus categorization process) were enhanced in the athletes and drummers’ groups. Overall, these results suggest that playing sport and drums led to similar benefits at behavioral and cognitive level as detectable in a cognitive task. Explanations of these findings, such as on the difference between drummers and other musicians, are provided in terms of long-term neural adaptation mechanisms and increased visuo-spatial abilities.

AB  - Abstract
The assessment of mental workload can inform attentional resource allocation during task performance that is essential for understanding the underlying principles of human cognitive-motor behavior. While many studies have focused on mental workload in relation to human performance, a modest body of work has examined it in a motor practice/learning context without considering individual variability. Thus, this work aimed to examine mental workload by employing the NASA TLX as well as the changes in motor performance resulting from the practice of a novel reaching task. Two groups of participants practiced a reaching task at a high and low nominal difficulty during which a group-level analysis assessed the mental workload, motor performance and motor improvement dynamics. A secondary cluster analysis was also conducted to identify specific individual patterns of cognitive-motor responses. Overall, both group- and cluster-level analyses revealed that: (i) all participants improved their performance throughout motor practice, and (ii) an increase in mental workload was associated with a reduction of the quality of motor performance along with a slower rate of motor improvement. The results are discussed in the context of the optimal challenge point framework and in particular it is proposed that under the experimental conditions employed here, functional task difficulty: (i) would possibly depend on an individuals’ information processing capabilities, and (ii) could be indexed by the level of mental workload which, when excessively heightened can decrease the quality of performance and more generally result in delayed motor improvements.

AB  - Abstract
Neural populations produce complex oscillatory patterns thought to implement brain function. The dominant rhythm in the healthy adult human brain is formed by alpha oscillations with a typical power peak most commonly found between 8 and 12 Hz. This alpha peak frequency has been repeatedly discussed as a highly heritable and stable neurophysiological “trait” marker reflecting anatomical properties of the brain, and individuals’ general cognitive capacity. However, growing evidence suggests that the alpha peak frequency is highly volatile at shorter time scales, dependent on the individuals’ “state”. Based on the converging experimental and theoretical results from numerous recent studies, here we propose that alpha frequency variability forms the basis of an adaptive mechanism mirroring the activation level of neural populations which has important functional implications. We here integrate experimental and computational perspectives to shed new light on the potential role played by shifts in alpha peak frequency and discuss resulting implications. We further propose a potential mechanism by which alpha oscillations are regulated in a noisy network of spiking neurons in presence of delayed feedback.

AB  - Abstract
Traumatic stress patients showed significant improvement in behavior after a prolonged exposure to an unrelated stimulus. This treatment method attempts to promote extinction of the fear memory associated with the initial traumatic experience. However, the subsequent prolonged exposure to such stimulus creates an additional layer of neural stress. Although the mechanism remains unclear, prolonged exposure therapy (PET) likely involves changes in synaptic plasticity, neurotransmitter function and inflammation; especially in parts of the brain concerned with the formation and retrieval of fear memory (Hippocampus and Prefrontal Cortex: PFC). Since certain synaptic proteins are also involved in danger-associated molecular pattern signaling (DAMP), we identified the significance of IGF-1/IGF-1R/CaMKIIα expression as a potential link between the concurrent progression of synaptic and inflammatory changes in stress. Thus, a comparison between IGF-1/IGF-1R/CaMKIIα, synaptic and DAMP proteins in stress and PET may highlight the significance of PET on synaptic morphology and neuronal inflammatory response.

In behaviorally characterized Sprague–Dawley rats, there was a significant decline in neural IGF-1 (p &lt; 0.001), hippocampal (p &lt; 0.001) and cortical (p &lt; 0.05) IGF-1R expression. These animals showed a significant loss of presynaptic markers (synaptophysin; p &lt; 0.001), and changes in neurotransmitters (VGLUT2, Tyrosine hydroxylase, GABA, ChAT). Furthermore, naïve stressed rats recorded a significant decrease in post-synaptic marker (PSD-95; p &lt; 0.01) and synaptic regulator (CaMKIIα; p &lt; 0.001). As part of the synaptic response to a decrease in brain CaMKIIα, small ion conductance channel (KCa2.2) was upregulated in the brain of naïve stressed rats (p &lt; 0.01). After a PET, an increase in IGF-1 (p &lt; 0.05) and IGF-1R was recorded in the Stress-PET group (p &lt; 0.001). As such, hippocampal (p &lt; 0.001), but not cortical (ns) synaptophysin expression increased in Stress-PET. Although PSD-95 was relatively unchanged in the hippocampus and PFC, CaMKIIα (p &lt; 0.001) and KCa2.2 (p &lt; 0.01) were upregulated in Stress-PET, and may be involved in extinction of fear memory-related synaptic potentials. These changes were also associated with a normalized neurotransmitter function, and a significant reduction in open space avoidance; when the animals were assessed in elevated plus maze (EPM). In addition to a decrease in IGF-1/IGF-1R, an increase in activated hippocampal and cortical microglia was seen in stress (p &lt; 0.05) and after a PET (Stress-PET; p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, this was linked with a significant increase in HMGB1 (Hippocampus: p &lt; 0.001, PFC: p &lt; 0.05) and TLR4 expression (Hippocampus: p &lt; 0.01; PFC: ns) in the neurons.

Taken together, this study showed that traumatic stress and subsequent PET involves an event-dependent alteration of IGF1/IGF-1R/CaMKIIα. Firstly, we showed a direct relationship between IGF-1/IGF-1R expression, presynaptic function (synaptophysin) and neurotransmitter activity in stress and PET. Secondly, we identified the possible role of CaMKIIα in post-synaptic function and regulation of small ion conductance channels. Lastly, we highlighted some of the possible links between IGF1/IGF-1R/CaMKIIα, the expression of DAMP proteins, Microglia activation, and its implication on synaptic plasticity during stress and PET.

AB  - Abstract
Mutations in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway or in the upstream negative regulator Pten cause human brain overgrowth disorders, such as focal cortical dysplasia and megalencephaly, and are characterized by the presence of hypertrophic neurons. These disorders often have a pediatric onset and a high comorbidity with drug-resistant epilepsy; however, effective pharmacological treatments are lacking. We established forebrain excitatory neuron-specific Pten-deficient cultures as an in vitro model of brain overgrowth disorders, and investigated the effects of this Pten mutation on PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and neuronal growth. Mutant neurons exhibit excessive PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling activity, enlarged somas and increased dendritic arborization. To understand the contributions of Akt and mTORC1 kinases to the hypertrophy phenotype, we evaluated the effects of short-term treatment with the Akt inhibitor MK-2206, and the mTORC1 inhibitor RAD001, which have shown safety and efficacy in human cancer clinical trials. We found that RAD001 treatment only partially reversed the morphological abnormalities of Pten mutant neurons, whereas MK-2206 treatment completely rescued the phenotype. Interestingly, neither treatment altered the size or morphology of normal neurons. Our results suggest that Akt is a major determinant of neuronal growth, and that Akt inhibition may be an effective strategy for pharmacological intervention in brain overgrowth disorders.

AB  - Abstract
The olivary pretectal nucleus (OPT) is a midbrain structure that receives reciprocal bilateral retinal projections, is involved in the pupillary light reflex, and connects reciprocally with the intergeniculate leaflet (IGL), a retinorecipient brain region that mediates behavioral responses to light pulses (i.e., masking) in diurnal Nile grass rats. Here, we lesioned the OPT and evaluated behavioral responses in grass rats to various lighting conditions, as well as their anxiety-like responses to light exposure. While control grass rats remained diurnal, grass rats with OPT lesions exhibited a more night-active pattern under 12 h:12 h light–dark (LD) conditions. However, when placed in constant darkness, OPT-lesioned grass rats became more active during their subjective day, suggesting that an exaggerated masking response to light may be responsible for the effect of OPT lesions on locomotor activity in LD. To test this hypothesis, we presented dark and light pulses to controls and grass rats with OPT lesions; controls increased their activity in response to light, whereas those with OPT lesions significantly increased activity in response to darkness. Further, when placed in a 7-h ultradian LD cycle, animals with OPT lesions were more active during darkness than controls. OPT lesions also abolished the pupillary light reflex, but did not affect anxiety-like behaviors. Finally, in animals with OPT lesions, light did not induce Fos expression in the ventrolateral geniculate nucleus, as it did in controls. Altogether, these results suggest that masking responses to light and darkness are dependent upon nuclei within the subcortical visual shell in grass rats.

AB  - Abstract
Hot flushes are common in menopause. Norepinephrine (NE), primarily synthesized in the locus coeruleus (LC), plays a major role in central thermoregulation. Furthermore, we previously observed decreased dopamine beta hydroxylase (DβH), a key enzyme in NE synthesis, in LC neurons following ovariectomy. In this study, we explore the mechanisms underlying decreased NE levels in the LC (LC-NE) in ovariectomized (OVX) rats, and the modulating effects of estradiol valerate (E2) and black cohosh (ICR). We used high-performance liquid chromatography to detect LC-NE in SHAM, OVX, OVX-E2, and OVX-ICR groups. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to investigate the expression of NE metabolic enzymes, the NE reuptake transporter (NET), and estrogen receptors (ERs) in the LC. We observed significant LC-NE decreases in the OVX group. E2 and ICR enhanced LC-NE but did not restore them to SHAM levels. Ovariectomy affected NE synthesis, degradation, and reuptake. Levels of NE catabolic enzymes monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) decreased, while NET expression increased. E2 restored MAOA and COMT to SHAM levels but had no effect on NET. ICR restored COMT and NET to SHAM levels but had no effect on MAOA. Moreover, the OVX group also exhibited decreased expression of ERα and ERβ. E2 enhanced the expression of ERα and ERβ, while ICR only enhanced ERβexpression. Taken together, reduced NE in OVX rats resulted from reduced synthesis and increased degradation and reuptake. E2 and ICR may regulate these processes in different ways through various ERs.

AB  - Abstract
Glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH) is a mitochondrial enzyme that is involved in the degradation of tryptophan, lysine and hydroxylysine. Deficient enzyme activity leads to glutaric aciduria type-I (GA-I). This neurometabolic disease usually manifests with acute encephalopathic crises and striatal neuronal death in early childhood leading to an irreversible dystonic-dyskinetic movement disorder. Fronto-temporal atrophy and white matter changes are already present in the pre-symptomatic period. No detailed information on GCDH expression during embryonic development and in adulthood was available so far.

Using immunofluorescence microscopy and cell-type-specific markers to localize GCDH in different tissues, we describe the differential cellular localization of GCDH in adult rat brain and peripheral organs as well as its spatiotemporal expression pattern.

During embryonic development GCDH was predominantly expressed in neurons of the central and peripheral nervous system. Significant expression levels were found in epithelial cells (skin, intestinal and nasal mucosa) of rat embryos at different developmental stages. Besides the expected strong expression in liver, GCDH was found to be significantly expressed in neurons of different brain regions, renal proximal tubules, intestinal mucosa and peripheral nerves of adult rats.

GCDH was found widely expressed in embryonic and adult rat tissues. In rat embryos GCDH is predominantly expressed in brain implying an important role for brain development. Interestingly, GCDH was found to be significantly expressed in different other organs (e.g. kidney, gut) in adult rats probably explaining the evolving phenotype in GA-I patients.

AB  - Abstract
In this study, we reexamined the effect of Cocaine-and-Amphetamine-Regulated-Transcript (CART) peptide on psychostimulant (PS)-induced locomotor activity (LMA) in individual rats. The Methods utilized were as previously published. The PS-induced LMA was defined as the distance traveled after PS administration (intraperitoneal), and the CART peptide effect was defined as the change in the PS-induced activity after bilateral intra-NAc administration of CART peptide. The experiments included both male and female Sprague-Dawley rats, and varying the CART peptide dose and the PS dose. While the average effect of CART peptide was to inhibit PS-induced LMA, the effect of CART peptide on individual PS-treated animals was not always inhibitory and sometimes even produced an increase or no change in PS-induced LMA. Upon further analysis, we observed a linear correlation, reported for the first time, between the magnitude of PS-induced LMA and the CART peptide effect. Because CART peptide inhibits PS-induced LMA when it is large, and increases PS-induced LMA when it is small, the peptide can be considered a homeostatic regulator of dopamine-induced LMA, which supports our earlier homeostatic hypothesis.

AB  - Abstract
Cortico-cortical connectivity has become a major focus of neuroscience in the last decade but most of the connectivity studies focused on intrahemispheric circuits. Little has been reported about information acquired and processed in the premotor cortex and its functional connection with its homotopic counterpart in the opposite hemisphere via the corpus callosum. In non-human primates (macaques) lateralization is not well documented and its exact role is still unknown. The present study confirms in two macaques the existence of homotopic contralateral projections and completes the picture by further exploring heterotopic (non-motor) callosal projections. This was tested by injecting retrograde tracers in the premotor cortical areas PMv and PMd (targets). Our method consisted of identifying the connections with all the homo- and heterotopic cortical areas located in the contralateral hemisphere. The results showed that PMd and PMv receive multiple low-density labeled inputs from the opposite heterotopic prefrontal, parietal, motor, insular and temporal regions. Such unexpected collection of transcallosal inputs from heterotopic areas suggests that the premotor areas communicate with other modalities through long distance low-density networks which could have important implications in the understanding of sensorimotor and multimodal integration.

AB  - Abstract
Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients are three to six times more likely to develop epilepsy compared to the rest of the population. Seizures are more common in patients with early onset or progressive forms of the disease and prognosticate rapid progression to disability and death. Gray matter atrophy, hippocampal lesions, interneuron loss, and elevated juxtacortical lesion burden have been identified in MS patients with seizures; however, translational studies aimed at elucidating the pathophysiological processes underlying MS epileptogenesis are limited. Here, we report that cuprizone-mediated chronically demyelinated (9–12 weeks) mice exhibit marked changes to dorsal hippocampal electroencephalography (EEG) and evidence of overt seizure activity. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses within the hippocampal CA1 region revealed extensive demyelination, loss of parvalbumin (PV+) interneurons, widespread gliosis, and changes in aquaporin-4 (AQP4) expression. Our results suggest that chronically demyelinated mice are a valuable model with which we may begin to understand the mechanisms underlying demyelination-induced seizures.

AB  - Abstract
Irreversible vision loss due to disease or age is responsible for a reduced quality of life. The experiments in this study test the hypothesis that the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, PNU-282987, leads to the generation of retinal neurons in an adult mammalian retina in the absence of retinal injury or exogenous growth factors. Using antibodies against BrdU, retinal ganglion cells, progenitor cells and Müller glia, the results of this study demonstrate that multiple types of retinal cells and neurons are generated after eye drop application of PNU-282987 in adult Long Evans rats in a dose-dependent manner. The results of this study provide evidence that progenitor cells, derived from Müller glia after treatment with PNU-282987, differentiate and migrate to the photoreceptor and retinal ganglion cell layers. If retinas were treated with the alpha7 nAChR antagonist, methyllycaconitine, before agonist treatment, BrdU-positive cells were significantly reduced. As adult mammalian neurons do not typically regenerate or proliferate, these results have implications for reversing vision loss due to neurodegenerative disease or the aging process to improve the quality of life for millions of patients.

AB  - Abstract
The cerebellum is known to be involved in temporal information processing. However, the underlying neuronal mechanisms remain unclear. In our previous study, monkeys were trained to make a saccade in response to a single omission of periodically presented visual stimuli. To detect stimulus omission, animals had to predict the timing of each next stimulus. During this task, neurons in the cerebellar dentate nucleus exhibited a transient decrement of activity followed by a gradual increase in firing rate that peaked around the time of the next stimulus (Ohmae et al., 2013). In the present study, to address how these two components of neuronal activity contributed to omission detection, we applied electrical microstimulation to the recording site at different timing during the task. We found that electrical stimulation just before the stimulus omission shortened the latencies of both contraversive and ipsiversive saccades. Because the changes in saccade latency non-linearly depended on the timing of stimulation in each inter-stimulus interval, and electrical stimulation just before the early stimulus in the sequence failed to evoke saccades, the neuronal activity in the dentate nucleus might regulate temporal prediction rather than facilitating saccade execution. Our results support the hypothesis that the firing modulation in each inter-stimulus interval in the dentate nucleus represents neuronal code for the temporal prediction of next stimulus.

AB  - Abstract
The unsaturated fatty acid, oleate exhibits anorexigenic properties reducing food intake and hepatic glucose output. However, its mechanism of action in the hypothalamus has not been fully determined. This study investigated the effects of oleate and glucose on GT1-7 mouse hypothalamic cells (a model of glucose-excited (GE) neurons) and mouse arcuate nucleus (ARC) neurons. Whole-cell and perforated patch-clamp recordings, immunoblotting and cell energy status measures were used to investigate oleate- and glucose-sensing properties of mouse hypothalamic neurons. Oleate or lowered glucose concentration caused hyperpolarization and inhibition of firing of GT1-7 cells by the activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels (KATP). This effect of oleate was not dependent on fatty acid oxidation or raised AMP-activated protein kinase activity or prevented by the presence of the UCP2 inhibitor genipin. Oleate did not alter intracellular calcium, indicating that CD36/fatty acid translocase may not play a role. However, oleate activation of KATP may require ATP metabolism. The short-chain fatty acid octanoate was unable to replicate the actions of oleate on GT1-7 cells. Although oleate decreased GT1-7 cell mitochondrial membrane potential there was no change in total cellular ATP or ATP/ADP ratios. Perforated patch and whole-cell recordings from mouse hypothalamic slices demonstrated that oleate hyperpolarized a subpopulation of ARC GE neurons by KATP activation. Additionally, in a separate small population of ARC neurons, oleate application or lowered glucose concentration caused membrane depolarization. In conclusion, oleate induces KATP-dependent hyperpolarization and inhibition of firing of a subgroup of GE hypothalamic neurons without altering cellular energy charge.

AB  - Abstract
Genistein (GEN) is a natural xenoestrogen (isoflavonoid) that may interfere with the development of estrogen-sensitive neural circuits. Due to the large and increasing use of soy-based formulas for babies (characterized by a high content of GEN), there are some concerns that this could result in an impairment of some estrogen-sensitive neural circuits and behaviors. In a previous study, we demonstrated that its oral administration to female mice during late pregnancy and early lactation induced a significant decrease of nitric oxide synthase-positive cells in the amygdala of their male offspring. In the present study, we have used a different experimental protocol mimicking, in mice, the direct precocious exposure to GEN. Mice pups of both sexes were fed either with oil, estradiol or GEN from birth to postnatal day 8. Nitric oxide synthase and vasopressin neural systems were analyzed in adult mice. Interestingly, we observed that GEN effect was time specific (when compared to our previous study), sex specific, and not always comparable to the effects of estradiol. This last observation suggests that GEN may act through different intracellular pathways.

Present results indicate that the effect of natural xenoestrogens on the development of the brain may be highly variable: a plethora of neuronal circuits may be affected depending on sex, time of exposure, intracellular pathway involved, and target cells. This raises concern on the possible long-term effects of the use of soy-based formulas for babies, which may be currently underestimated.

AB  - Abstract
Brain dysfunction is a frequent complication of the systemic inflammatory response to bacterial infection or sepsis. In the present work, the effects of intravenous bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration on cerebral arterial blood flow were assessed with time-of-flight (TOF)-based magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in mice. Cerebral expression of the transcription factors nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) and c-Fos and that of enzymes synthesizing vasoactive mediators, such as prostaglandins and nitric oxide, known to be increased under inflammatory conditions, were studied in the same animals. Time-resolved TOF MRA revealed no differences in blood flow in the internal carotids upstream of the circle of Willis, but indicated lower flow in its lateral parts as well as in the middle and anterior cerebral arteries after intravenous LPS injection as compared to saline administration. Although LPS did not increase c-Fos expression in ventral forebrain structures of these animals, it did induce NF-κB in meningeal blood vessels. LPS also increased cerebral expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and prostaglandin E synthase mRNAs, but de novo expression occurred in veins rather than in arteries. In conclusion, our work indicates that LPS-induced systemic inflammation does not necessarily affect filling of the circle of the Willis from the periphery, but that circulating LPS alters outflow from the circle of Willis to the middle and anterior cerebral arteries. These modifications in arterial flow were not related to increased cerebral synthesis of prostaglandins, but may instead be the consequence of the action of circulating prostaglandins and other vasoactive mediators on brain-irrigating arteries during systemic inflammation.

AB  - Abstract
The somatostatin 4 receptor (sst4) is widely expressed in stress-related brain areas (e.g. hippocampus, amygdala) and regulates the emotional behavior in acute situations. Since its importance in chronic stress-induced complex pathophysiological alterations is unknown, we investigated the involvement of sst4 in the responsiveness to chronic variable stress (CVS). Sstr4 gene-deficient (Sstr4−/−) mice and their wildtype counterparts (Sstr4+/+) were used to examine the behavioral and neuroendocrine alterations as well as chronic neuronal activity (FosB expression) changes in response to CVS. In Sstr4+/+ mice, there was no behavioral response to the applied CVS paradigm. In contrast, immobility time in the tail suspension test increased after the CVS in the knockouts. In the forced swim test, Sstr4−/− animals showed increased baseline immobility and then it decreased after the CVS. Light–dark box and open field test behaviors and sucrose preference did not respond to the stress in the knockouts. Adrenal weights increased and thymus weights decreased in both Sstr4+/+ and Sstr4−/− mice demonstrating the effect of chronic stress. The relative adrenal weight of stressed knockouts increased to a greater extent, while relative thymus and body weights decreased only in the Sstr4−/− mice. Basal plasma corticosterone concentrations did not change after the CVS in either genotype. FosB immunopositivity in the central and basolateral amygdaloid nuclei was enhanced in stressed knockouts, but not in wild types. This is the first evidence that sst4 activation is involved in the behavioral and neuroendocrine alterations induced by chronic stress with a crucial role of plastic changes in the amygdala.

AB  - Abstract
Multiple sclerosis (MS), a neuroinflammatory disease, has few treatment options, none entirely adequate. We studied whether prolonged electrical microstimulation of a hindbrain region (the nucleus raphe magnus) can attenuate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a murine model of MS induced by MOG35-55 injection. Eight days after symptoms emerged, a wireless electrical stimulator with an attached microelectrode was implanted cranially, and daily intermittent stimulation was begun in awake, unrestrained mice. The thoracic spinal cord was analyzed for changes in histology (on day 29) and gene expression (on day 37), with a focus on myelination and cytokine production. Controls, with inactive implants, showed a phase of disease exacerbation on days 19–25 that stimulation for &gt;16 days eliminated. Prolonged stimulation also reduced numbers of infiltrating immune cells and increased numbers of myelinated axons. It additionally lowered genetic expression of some pro-inflammatory cytokines (interferon gamma and tumor necrosis factor) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha, a marker of oligodendrocyte precursors, while raising expression of myelin basic protein. Studies of restorative treatments for MS might profitably consider ways to stimulate the raphe magnus, directly or via its inputs, or to emulate its serotonergic and peptidergic output.

AB  - Abstract
Adolescence is a period during which the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) undergoes significant remodeling. The netrin-1 receptor, deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), controls the extent and organization of mPFC dopamine connectivity during adolescence and in turn directs mPFC functional and structural maturation. Dcc haploinsufficiency leads to increased mPFC dopamine input, which causes improved cognitive processing and resilience to behavioral effects of stimulant drugs of abuse. Here we examine the effects of Dcc haploinsufficiency on the dynamic expression of dopamine receptors in forebrain targets of C57BL6 mice. We conducted quantitative receptor autoradiography experiments with [3H]SCH-23390 or [3H]raclopride to characterize D1 and D2 receptor expression in mPFC and striatal regions in male Dcc haploinsufficient and wild-type mice. We generated autoradiograms at early adolescence (PND21 ± 1), mid-adolescence (PND35 ± 2), and adulthood (PND75 ± 15). C57BL6 mice exhibit overexpression and pruning of D1, but not D2, receptors in striatal regions, and a lack of dopamine receptor pruning in the mPFC. We observed age- and region-specific differences in D1 and D2 receptor density between Dcc haploinsufficient and wild-type mice. Notably, neither group shows the typical pattern of mPFC dopamine receptor pruning in adolescence, but adult haploinsufficient mice show increased D2 receptor density in the mPFC. These results show that DCC receptors contribute to the dynamic refinement of D1 and D2 receptor expression in striatal regions across adolescence. The age-dependent expression of dopamine receptor in C57BL6 mice shows marked differences from previous characterizations in rats.

AB  - Abstract
Peptidergic dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons transmit sensory and nociceptive information from the periphery to the central nervous system. Their synaptic activity is profoundly affected by neuromodulatory peptides stored and released from large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs). However, the mechanism of peptide secretion from DRG neurons is poorly understood. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), we visualized individual LDCVs loaded with fluorescent neuropeptide Y (NPY) and analyzed their stimulation-dependent release. We tested several protocols and found an overall low stimulation-secretion coupling that increased after raising intracellular Ca2+ concentration by applying a weak pre-stimulus. Interestingly, the stimulation protocol also influenced the mechanism of LDCV fusion. Depolarization of DRG neurons with a solution containing 60 mM KCl triggered full fusion, kiss-and-run, and kiss-and-stay exocytosis with equal frequency. In contrast, field electrode stimulation primarily induced full fusion exocytosis. Finally, our results indicate that NPY can promote LDCV secretion. These results shed new light on the mechanism of NPY action during modulation of DRG neuron activity, an important pathway in the treatment of chronic pain.

AB  - Abstract
Heightened concentrations of CO2 in inhaled air provoke temporary acidification of the brain, followed by compensatory hyperventilation and increased arousal/anxiety. These responses are likely to map a basic, latent general alarm/avoidance system that is largely shared across mammals, and are sources of individual differences. By showing paroxysmal respiratory and emotional responses to CO2 challenges, humans with panic and separation anxiety disorders lie at one extreme of the distribution for CO2 sensitivity. This is also a developmental trait, sensitive to interference with parental cares.

By sharing CO2 sensitivity with humans, rodents constitute a valuable resource to model panic and separation anxiety in the laboratory. Advantages of modeling CO2 sensitivity in rodents include non-inferential measurements (e.g. respiratory readouts) as proxies for human conditions, unbiased investigation of gene–environment interplays, and flexible availability of tissues for mechanistic studies.

Data in humans and animals such as those reported in this issue of Neuroscience begin to reveal that CO2-driven behavioral responses stem from anatomo-physiological systems that are relatively separated from those subserving general dispositions to anxiety. This supports the notion that sensitivity to suffocative stimuli and ensuing human panic are significantly independent from trait/cognitive anxiety, and corroborates newer conceptualizations that distinguish between fear and anxiety circuitries.

The current standard of care (SOC) for GBM is initial surgical resection followed by treatment with a combination of temozolomide (TMZ) and ionizing radiation (IR). However, GBM has a dismal prognosis, and survivors have compromised quality of life owing to the adverse effects of radiation. GBM is characterized by overt activity of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. GDC-0941 is a highly specific PI3K inhibitor with promising anti-tumor activity in human solid tumors. It is being evaluated in Phase II clinical trials for the treatment of breast and non-squamous cell lung cancer.

We hypothesized that GDC-0941 may act as an antitumor agent and potentiate the effects of TMZ and IR. In this study, GDC-0941 alone induced cytotoxicity and pro-apoptotic effects. Moreover, combined with the standard GBM therapy (TMZ and IR), it suppressed cell viability, showed enhanced pro-apoptotic effects, augmented autophagy response, and attenuated migratory/invasive capacity in three glioma cell lines. Protein microarray analyses showed that treatment with TMZ+GDC-0941+IR induced higher levels of p53 and glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3-β) expression in SHG44GBM cells than those induced by other treatments. This was verified in all cell lines by western blot analysis. Furthermore, the combination of TMZ and GDC-0941 with or without IR reduced the levels of p-AKT and O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) in T98G cells. The results of this study suggest that the combination of TMZ, IR, and GDC-0941 is a promising choice for future treatments of GBM.

AB  - Abstract
Language experience shapes encoding of pitch-relevant information at both brainstem and cortical levels of processing. Pitch height is a salient dimension that orders pitch from low to high. Herein we investigate the effects of language experience (Chinese, English) in the brainstem and cortex on (i) neural responses to variations in pitch height, (ii) presence of asymmetry in cortical pitch representation, and (iii) patterns of relative changes in magnitude of pitch height between these two levels of brain structure. Stimuli were three nonspeech homologs of Mandarin Tone 2 varying in pitch height only. The frequency-following response (FFR) and the cortical pitch-specific response (CPR) were recorded concurrently. At the Fz-linked T7/T8 site, peak latency of Na, Pb, and Nb decreased with increasing pitch height for both groups. Peak-to-peak amplitude of Na–Pb and Pb–Nb increased with increasing pitch height across groups. A language-dependent effect was restricted to Na–Pb; the Chinese had larger amplitude than the English group. At temporal sites (T7/T8), the Chinese group had larger amplitude, as compared to English, across stimuli, but also limited to the Na–Pb component and right temporal site. In the brainstem, F0 magnitude decreased with increasing pitch height; Chinese had larger magnitude across stimuli. A comparison of CPR and FFR responses revealed distinct patterns of relative changes in magnitude common to both groups. CPR amplitude increased and FFR amplitude decreased with increasing pitch height. Experience-dependent effects on CPR components vary as a function of neural sensitivity to pitch height within a particular temporal window (Na–Pb). Differences between the auditory brainstem and cortex imply distinct neural mechanisms for pitch extraction at both levels of brain structure.

AB  - Abstract
Hypoxic ischemic insults predispose to perinatal brain injury. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are important in the evolution of this injury. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a key mediator of inflammatory responses and elevated IL-1β levels in brain correlate with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes after brain injury. Impaired blood–brain barrier (BBB) function represents an important component of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in the fetus. In addition, ischemia–reperfusion increases cytokine transport across the BBB of the ovine fetus. Reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine entry into brain could represent a novel approach to attenuate ischemia-related brain injury. We hypothesized that infusions of neutralizing IL-1β monoclonal antibody (mAb) reduce IL-1β transport across the BBB after ischemia in the fetus. Fetal sheep were studied 24-h after 30-min of carotid artery occlusion. Fetuses were treated with placebo- or anti-IL-1β mAb intravenously 15-min and 4-h after ischemia. Ovine IL-1β protein expressed from IL-1β pGEX-2T vectors in Escherichia coli (E. coli) BL-21 cells was produced, purified, and radiolabeled with 125I. BBB permeability was quantified using the blood-to-brain transfer constant (Ki) with 125I-radiolabeled-IL-1β. Increases in anti-IL-1β mAb were observed in the brain of the mAb-treated group (P &lt; 0.001). Blood-to-brain transport of 125I-IL-1β was lower (P &lt; 0.04) across brain regions in the anti-IL-1β mAb-treated than placebo-treated ischemic fetuses. Plasma 125I-IL-1β counts were higher (P &lt; 0.001) in the anti-IL-1β mAb- than placebo-treated ischemic fetuses. Systemic infusions of anti-IL-1β mAb reduce IL-1β transport across the BBB after ischemia in the ovine fetus. Our findings suggest that conditions associated with increases in systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurodevelopmental impairment could benefit from an anti-cytokine therapeutic strategy.

AB  - Abstract
Imaging studies have described hemodynamic activity during fear conditioning protocols with stimulus trains in which a visual conditioned stimulus (CS+) is paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US, painful laser pulse) while another visual stimulus is unpaired (CS−). We now test the hypothesis that CS Event Related Spectral Perturbations (ERSPs) are related to ratings of CS Expectancy (likelihood of pairing with the US), Valence (unpleasantness) and Salience (ability to capture attention). ERSP windows in EEG were defined by both time after the CS and frequency, and showed increased oscillatory power (Event Related Synchronization, ERS) in the Delta/Theta Windows (0–8 Hz) and the Gamma Window (30–55 Hz). Decreased oscillatory power (Event Related Desynchronization – ERD) was found in Alpha (8–14 Hz) and Beta Windows (14–30 Hz). The Delta/Theta ERS showed a differential effect of CS+ versus CS− at Prefrontal, Frontal and Midline Channels, while Alpha and Beta ERD were greater at Parietal and Occipital Channels early in the stimulus train. The Gamma ERS Window increased from habituation to acquisition over a broad area from frontal and occipital electrodes. The CS Valence and Salience were greater for CS+ than CS−, and were correlated with each other and with the ERD at overlapping channels, particularly in the Alpha Window. Expectancy and CS Skin Conductance Response were greater for CS+ than CS− and were correlated with ERSP at fewer channels than Valence or Salience. These results suggest that Alpha ERSP activity during fear conditioning reflects Valence and Salience of the CSs more than conditioning per se.

AB  - Abstract
Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) have become powerful tools in neuroscience for both basic research and potential therapeutic use. They have become especially important tools for optogenetic experiments based on their ability to achieve transgene expression in postmitotic neurons with regional selectivity. With the use of appropriate promoter elements they can achieve cellular specificity as well. One population of neurons that plays a central role in human neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases are the dopamine neurons of the midbrain. To study these neurons in vivo with advanced techniques it would be highly advantageous to characterize an appropriate specific promoter. To this end we have characterized a 2.5-kb sequence of the rat tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) promoter. The rTHp(2.5) promoter induced expression of the fluorescent reporter protein mCherry in SN dopamine neurons. Although it showed excellent specificity in cortex and striatum, where no reporter expression was observed, in the SN region many neurons expressed reporter but not TH. We show that some of the TH negativity is due to the suppression of its expression by the transgene. We conclude that rTHp(2.5) does preferentially label dopamine neurons but its specificity is not complete within the substantia nigra and caution must be used.

AB  - Abstract
The melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is expressed in several brain nuclei playing a crucial role in the regulation of energy balance controlling the homeostasis of the organism. It displays both agonist-evoked and constitutive activity, and moreover, it can couple to different G proteins. Most of the research on MC4R has been focused on agonist-induced activity, while the molecular and cellular basis of MC4R constitutive activity remains scarcely studied.

We have previously shown that neuronal N-type voltage-gated calcium channels (CaV2.2) are inhibited by MC4R agonist-dependent activation, while the CaV subtypes that carry L- and P/Q-type current are not. Here, we tested the hypothesis that MC4R constitutive activity can affect CaV, with focus on the channel subtypes that can control transcriptional activity coupled to depolarization (L-type, CaV1.2/1.3) and neurotransmitter release (N- and P/Q-type, CaV2.2 and CaV2.1). We found that MC4R constitutive activity inhibits specifically CaV1.2/1.3 and CaV2.1 subtypes of CaV. We also explored the signaling pathways mediating this inhibition, and thus propose that agonist-dependent and basal MC4R activation modes signal differentially through Gs and Gi/o pathways to impact on different CaV subtypes. In addition, we found that chronic incubation with MC4R endogenous inverse agonist, agouti and agouti-related peptide (AgRP), occludes CaV inhibition in a cell line and in amygdaloid complex cultured neurons as well. Thus, we define new mechanisms of control of the main mediators of depolarization-induced calcium entry into neurons by a GPCR that displays constitutive activity.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic infusion of aldosterone into the 4th ventricle (4th V) induces robust daily sodium intake, whereas acute injection of aldosterone into the 4th V produces no sodium intake. The inhibitory mechanism of the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) restrains sodium intake induced by different natriorexigenic stimuli and might affect the acute response to aldosterone into the 4th V. In the present study, 1.8% NaCl and water intake was tested in rats treated with acute injections of aldosterone into the 4th V combined with the blockade of the inhibitory mechanisms with injections of moxonidine (α2 adrenergic/imidazoline agonist) or methysergide (a serotonergic antagonist) into the LPBN. Male Holtzman rats with stainless steel cannulas implanted in the 4th V and bilaterally in the LPBN were used. Aldosterone (250 or 500 ng) into the 4th V combined with vehicle into the LPBN induced no 1.8% NaClintake compared to control (1.5 ± 1.1 and 1.1 ± 0.4, respectively, vs. vehicle into 4th V: 1.0 ± 0.5 ml/2 h). However, aldosterone (250 or 500 ng) into the 4th V combined with moxonidine (0.5 nmol) into the LPBN induced strong ingestion of 1.8% NaCl (12.7 ± 4.6 and 17.6 ± 3.7 ml/2 h, respectively). Aldosterone (250 ng) into the 4th V combined with methysergide (4 μg) into the LPBN also induced 1.8% NaCl intake (17.6 ± 5.4 ml/2 h). These data suggest that the inhibitory mechanisms of the LPBN counteract the facilitation of sodium intake produced by aldosterone injected into the 4th, restraining sodium intake in this condition.

AB  - Abstract
The state of microglial activation provides important information about the central nervous system. However, a reliable index of microglial activation in histological samples has yet to be established. Here, we show that microglial activation induces topological changes of Iba1 localization that can be detected by analysis based on homology theory. Analysis of homology was applied to images of Iba1-stained tissue sections, and the 0-dimentional Betti number (b0: the number of solid components) and the 1-dimentional Betti number (b1: the number of windows surrounded by solid components) were obtained. We defined b1/b0 as the Homology Value (HV), and investigated its validity as an index of microglial activation using cerebral ischemia model mice. Microglial activation was accompanied by changes to Iba1 localization and morphology of microglial processes. In single microglial cells, the change of Iba1 localization increased b1. Conversely, thickening or retraction of microglial processes decreased b0. Consequently, microglial activation increased the HV. The HV of a tissue area increased with proximity to the ischemic core and showed a high degree of concordance with the number of microglia expressing activation makers. Furthermore, the HV of human metastatic brain tumor tissue also increased with proximity to the tumor. These results suggest that our index, based on homology theory, can be used to correctly evaluate microglial activation in various tissue images.

AB  - Abstract
Painful events early in life have been shown to increase the incidence of interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome in adulthood. However, the intrinsic mechanism is not well studied. We previously reported that neonatal bladder inflammation causes chronic visceral hypersensitivity along with molecular disruption of spinal GABAergic system in rats. The present study investigates whether these molecular changes affect the integrative function and responses of bladder-sensitive primary afferent and spinal neurons. Neonatal bladder inflammation was induced by intravesicular injection of zymosan during postnatal (P) days 14–16. In adulthood (P60), the viscero-motor response (VMR) to visceral stimuli was significantly inhibited by intrathecal (i.t) HZ166 (GABAAα-2 agonist) only in neonatally saline-treated, but not in neonatally zymosan-treated rats. HZ166 significantly inhibited the responses of bladder-responsive lumbosacral (LS) spinal neurons to urinary bladder distension (UBD) and slow infusion (SI) in neonatally saline-treated rats. Similar results were also observed in naïve adult rats where HZ166 produced significant inhibition of bladder-responsive spinal neurons. However, HZ166 did not inhibit responses of UBD-responsive spinal neurons from neonatally zymosan-treated rats. The drug did not attenuate the responses of UBD-sensitive pelvic nerve afferent (PNA) fibers to UBD and SI in either group of rats tested. Immunohistochemical studies showed a significantly lower level of GABAAα-2 receptor expression in the LS spinal cord of neonatally zymosan-treated rats compared to saline-treated rats. These findings indicate that neonatal bladder inflammation leads to functional and molecular alteration of spinal GABAAα-2 receptor subtypes, which may result in chronic visceral hyperalgesia in adulthood.

AB  - Abstract
Vocal communication is required for successful social interactions in numerous species. During the breeding season, songbirds produce songs that are reinforced by behavioral consequences (e.g., copulation). However, some songbirds also produce songs not obviously directed at other individuals. The consequences maintaining or reinforcing these songs are less obvious and the neural mechanisms associated with undirected communication are not well-understood. Previous studies indicate that undirected singing is intrinsically rewarding and mediated by opioid or dopaminergic systems; however, endocannabinoids are also involved in regulating reward and singing behavior. We used a conditioned place preference paradigm to examine song-associated reward in European starlings and quantitative real-time PCR to measure expression of endocannabinoid-related neural markers (CB1, FABP7, FABP5, FAAH, DAGLα), in brain regions involved in social behavior, reward and motivation (ventral tegmental area [VTA], periaqueductal gray [PAG], and medial preoptic nucleus [POM]), and a song control region (Area X). Our results indicate that starlings producing high rates of song developed a conditioned place preference, suggesting that undirected song is associated with a positive affective state. We found a significant positive relationship between song-associated reward and CB1 receptors in VTA and a significant negative relationship between song-associated reward and CB1 in PAG. There was a significant positive relationship between reward and the cannabinoid transporter FABP7 in POM and a significant negative relationship between reward and FABP7 in PAG. In Area X, FABP5 and DAGLα correlated positively with singing. These results suggest a role for endocannabinoid signaling in vocal production and reward associated with undirected communication.

AB  - Abstract
Persistent developmental stuttering is a neurologically based speech disorder associated with cognitive-linguistic, motor and emotional abnormalities. Previous studies investigating the relationship between anxiety and stuttering have yielded mixed results, but it has not yet been examined whether anxiety influences brain activity underlying stuttering. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated the functional connectivity associated with state anxiety in a syllable repetition task, and trait anxiety during rest in adults who stutter (N = 19) and fluent controls (N = 19). During the speech task, people who stutter (PWS) showed increased functional connectivity of the right amygdala with the prefrontal gyrus (the left ventromedial frontal gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus) and the left insula compared to controls. During rest, PWS showed stronger functional connectivity between the right hippocampus and the left orbital frontal gyrus, and between the left hippocampus and left motor areas than controls. Taken together, our results suggest aberrant bottom-up and/or top-down interactions for anxiety regulation, which might be responsible for the higher level of state anxiety during speech and for the anxiety-prone trait in PWS. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the neural underpinnings of anxiety in PWS, thus yielding new insight into the causes of stuttering which might aid strategies for the diagnosis and treatment of stuttering.

AB  - Abstract
Previous work (Brown et al., 2003a,b) has shown that limb position drifts when individuals make repetitive movements in the absence of visual feedback. The purpose of this study was to examine whether limb position drift might reflect a misalignment in visual and proprioceptive maps by examining the nature of information used to specify new movements from a drifted limb position. In a virtual reality (VR) environment, participants made continuous movements with their dominant right hand between two targets positioned 15 cm apart, paced by a 0.625-Hz metronome. After 5 cycles, cursor feedback of the hand was removed for the next 44 cycles, which induced an average drift in hand position of roughly 5 cm. On the 50th cycle, participants were required to move to one of 6 new targets from the drifted hand position. Kinematic analysis indicated that movement direction was unambiguously determined by the visual input marked by the original start position, or the last-seen hand position. Forward dynamics analysis revealed that current limb configuration was used to inform joint torques to produce this parallel direction. For new movement specification, accurate proprioceptive information about the drifted limb position was used, even though it was apparently not available for detecting drift in the first place. Movement distance varied directly with the extent of limb drift, although the differentiation of visual and proprioceptive control of distance could not be analyzed, as our control conditions were not significantly different for this measure. We suggest that movement drift, in the absence of visual feedback during cyclic repetitive movements, reflects a misalignment between largely accurate visual and proprioceptive maps, rather than a weighted fusion of the two modalities.

AB  - Abstract
A better understanding of BOLD responses stems from a better characterization of the brain’s ability to metabolize glucose and oxygen. Non-invasive techniques such as functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS) have thus been developed allowing for the reproducible assessment of metabolic changes during barrel cortex (S1BF) activations in rats. The present study aimed at further exploring the role of neurotransmitters on local and temporal changes in vascular and metabolic function in S1BF. fMRS and fMRI data were acquired sequentially in α-chloralose anesthetized rats during 32-min rest and trigeminal nerve stimulation periods. During stimulation, concentrations of lactate (Lac) and glutamate (Glu) increased in S1BF by 0.23 ± 0.05 and 0.34 ± 0.05 μmol/g respectively in S1BF. Dynamic analysis of metabolite concentrations allowed estimating changes in cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (ΔCMRGlc) and oxygen (ΔCMRO2). Findings confirmed a prevalence of oxidative metabolism during prolonged S1BF activation. Habituation led to a significant BOLD magnitude decline as a function of time while both total ΔCMRGlc and ΔCMRO2 remained constant revealing adaptation of glucose and oxygen metabolisms to support ongoing trigeminal nerve stimulation.

AB  - Abstract
In adult stroke models, the neuroprotective protein, Iduna, inhibits poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1)-dependent cell death by decreasing apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) nuclear translocation. Because the PARP1-dependent pathway and Iduna, which promotes AIF degradation, contribute to hypoxic–ischemic (HI) brain damage in the immature brain, we examined the relationship between Iduna expression and AIF nuclear translocation in the cerebral cortex of postnatal day 7 rats after HI. Ninety rats were divided into three groups: sham, 1-h hypoxia and 2-h hypoxia. The HI insult was induced by permanent ligation of the left common carotid artery plus 1 or 2 h of hypoxia. Brain damage pathological features were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining, Nissl staining, transmission electron microscopy, TUNEL staining and immunofluorescence. Immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis were used to assess protein expression and ubiquitination status of AIF. The interaction between Iduna and AIF was tested by co-immunoprecipitation. Learning and memory were analyzed by the Morris water maze test. Compared with sham animals, the number of surviving neurons in the cerebral cortex decreased, and cell damage and DNA breakage were severe in rats with HI, with worse damage in the 2-h group. Iduna expression significantly decreased, whereas nuclear AIF expression increased. Furthermore, Iduna downregulation negatively correlated with nuclear AIF abundance in the 2-h HI group (r = −0.950; P &lt; 0.0001). Additionally, learning and memory ability decreased with hypoxic time. These results suggest that AIF nuclear translocation and neuronal cell death are associated with Iduna loss after severe HI in the immature brain.

AB  - Abstract
Resting state networks’ (RSNs) architecture is well delineated in mature brain, but our understanding of their development remains limited. Particularly, there are few longitudinal studies. Besides, all existing evidence is obtained using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and there are no data on electrophysiological correlates of RSN maturation. We acquired three yearly waves of resting state EEG data in 80 children between 7 and 9 years and in 55 adults. Children’s parents filled in the Effortful Control (EC) scale. Seed-based oscillatory power envelope correlation in conjunction with beamformer spatial filtering was used to obtain electrophysiological signatures of the default mode network (DMN) and two task-positive networks (TPN). In line with existing fMRI evidence, both cross-sectional comparison with adults and longitudinal analysis showed that the general pattern of maturation consisted in an increase in long-distance connections with posterior cortical regions and a decrease in short connections within prefrontal cortical areas. Latent growth curve analysis showed that EC scores were predicted by a linear increase over time in DMN integrity in alpha band and an increase in the segregation between DMN and TPN in beta band. These data confirm the neural basis of observed in fMRI research maturation-related changes and show that integrity of the DMN and sufficient level of segregation between DMN and TPN is a prerequisite for appropriate attentional and behavioral control.

AB  - Abstract
The main objective of the present study was to identify markers of neural deficits in children with central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) by measuring latency and amplitude of the auditory cortical responses and mismatch negativity (MMN) responses. Passive oddball paradigms were used with nonverbal and verbal stimuli to record cortical auditory-evoked potentials and MMN. Twenty-three children aged 9–12 participated in the study: 10 with normal hearing acuity as well as CAPD and 13 with normal hearing without CAPD. No significant group differences were observed for P1 latency and amplitude. Children with CAPD were observed to have significant N2 latency prolongation and amplitude reduction with nonverbal and verbal stimuli compared to children without CAPD. No significant group differences were observed for the MMN conditions. Moreover, electrode position affected the results in the same manner for both groups of children. The findings of the present study suggest that the N2 response could be a marker of neural deficits in children with CAPD. N2 results suggest that maturational factors or a different mechanism could be involved in processing auditory information at the central level for these children.

AB  - Abstract
Inward rectifying potassium – Kir – channels drive the resting potential to potassium reversal potential and, when disrupted, might be related to muscular diseases. Recently, Thyrotoxic Periodic Paralysis (TPP) has emerged as a channelopathy related to mutations in KCNJ18 gene, which encodes Kir2.6 channel. TPP is a neuromuscular disorder characterized by a triad of muscle weakness, hypokalemia, and thyrotoxicosis, the latter being essential for the crisis. Direct sequencing revealed two heterozygous mutations – D252N and R386C – in two TPP patients. KCNJ18 cDNAs were cloned into mammalian expression plasmids and transiently expressed in HEK 293T cells to investigate the functional effects of Kir2.6 mutations. Patch-clamp and confocal laser scanning microscopy experiments were carried out, comparing the WT channel to its mutants. D252N mutation down-regulates the Kir2.6 activity, decreasing the K+ current density (∼34%) when compared to the WT channel; whereas the mutation R386C shows no significant changes from WT. The mutant D252N Kir2.6 channel also showed a substantial reduction of ∼51% in membrane abundance relative to WT channel. Our study describes the functional consequences of a single amino acid change in Kir2.6 channel. Further analysis regarding hormonal conditions and Kir channel expression are required to provide new clues about the TPP pathophysiology.

AB  - Abstract
Previous research has demonstrated that aerobic exercise has disparate effects on speed of processing and movement execution. In simple and choice reaction tasks, aerobic exercise appears to increase speed of movement execution while speed of processing is unaffected. In the flanker task, aerobic exercise has been shown to reduce response time on incongruent trials more than congruent trials, purportedly reflecting a selective influence on speed of processing related to cognitive control. However, it is unclear how changes in speed of processing and movement execution contribute to these exercise-induced changes in response time during the flanker task. This study examined how a single session of aerobic exercise influences speed of processing and movement execution during a flanker task using electromyography to partition response time into reaction time and movement time, respectively. Movement time decreased during aerobic exercise regardless of flanker congruence but returned to pre-exercise levels immediately after exercise. Reaction time during incongruent flanker trials decreased over time in both an aerobic exercise and non-exercise control condition indicating it was not specifically influenced by exercise. This disparate influence of aerobic exercise on movement time and reaction time indicates the importance of partitioning response time when examining the influence of aerobic exercise on speed of processing. The decrease in reaction time over time independent of aerobic exercise indicates that interpreting pre-to-post exercise changes in behavior requires caution.

AB  - Abstract
Working memory (WM) refers to the holding and manipulation of information during cognitive tasks. Its underlying neural mechanisms have been explored through both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). Trial-by-trial coupling of simultaneously collected EEG and fMRI signals has become an important and promising approach to study the spatio-temporal dynamics of such cognitive processes. Previous studies have demonstrated a modulation effect of the WM load on both the BOLD response in certain brain areas and the amplitude of P3. However, much remains to be explored regarding the WM load-dependent relationship between the amplitude of ERP components and cortical activities, and the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the EEG signal still poses a challenge to performing single-trial analyses. In this paper, we investigated the spatio-temporal activities of P3 during an n-back verbal WM task by introducing an adaptive wavelet denoiser into the extraction of single-trial P3 features and using general linear model (GLM) to integrate simultaneously collected EEG and fMRI data. Our results replicated the modulation effect of the WM load on the P3 amplitude. Additionally, the activation of single-trial P3 amplitudes was detected in multiple brain regions, including the insula, the cuneus, the lingual gyrus (LG), and the middle occipital gyrus (MOG). Moreover, we found significant correlations between P3 features and behavioral performance. These findings suggest that the single-trial integration of simultaneous EEG and fMRI signals may provide new insights into classical cognitive functions.

AB  - Abstract
World-wide, two degenerative retinal diseases, glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration, are estimated to affect more than 12% of individuals over the age of 40 (Tham et al., 2014; Wong et al., 2014). Current therapies can slow progression, but cannot restore lost neurons or vision. Thus, there is increasing interest in developing strategies for therapeutic retinal regeneration. Nearly 50 years of research on retinal neurogenesis and regeneration has identified Müller glia as intrinsic retinal stem cells in teleost fish. In the mammalian retina, there is no de novo neurogenesis in adults and only very limited injury-induced regeneration has been induced using exogenous growth factors. The study by (Webster et al., 2017) (Evidence of BrdU Positive Retinal Neurons after Application of an Alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Agonist, this issue) is the first to show robust, retinal neurogenesis in an adult, mammalian retina in the absence of overt injury and provides evidence that the source of the new neurons is likely to be the Müller glia. This exciting finding has the potential to be a game-changer in the field of retinal regeneration.

AB  - Abstract
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with cognitive deficits and an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recently, a newly identified heptapeptide of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), angiotensin-(1–7) [Ang-(1–7)], was found to protect against brain damage. This study investigated the effects of Ang-(1–7) on diabetes-induced cognitive deficits. Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups. Diabetes was induced via single i.p. streptozotocin (STZ) injections. Ten weeks after diabetes induction, rats in each group received an intracerebral-ventricular (ICV) infusion of either vehicle, Ang-(1–7) alone, or Ang-(1–7) + A779 daily for two weeks. At the end of the study, Morris water maze (MWM) tests were performed to test cognitive functions before the rats were euthanized. Ang-(1–7) treatment significantly reduced escape latencies in diabetic rats in acquisition trials and markedly enhanced platform area crossing frequency and time spent in the target quadrant in probe trials (3.0 ± 0.39 vs. 1.0 ± 0.33, 39.39 ± 1.11% vs. 25.62 ± 3.07%, respectively, P &lt; 0.01). Ang-(1–7) treatment ameliorated damage to the ultrastructure of hippocampal synapses, reduced the expression of hippocampal phospho-tau at Ser396 (P &lt; 0.01), Ser404 (P &lt; 0.01) and Ser202/Thr205 (P &lt; 0.05), and decreased amyloid-β oligomer and both soluble and insoluble β-amyloid peptide 1–42 (Aβ 1–42) and Aβ 1–40 levels (P &lt; 0.01). These protective effects were significantly reversed by the co-administration of A779. These findings show that Ang-(1–7) is a promising therapeutic target for diabetes-induced cognitive impairment. The neuroprotective effects of Ang-(1–7) were mainly through Mas receptor (MasR) activation.

AB  - Abstract
Growing evidence from epidemiological studies strongly suggests maternal infection as a risk factor for psychiatric disorders including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and autism. Animal studies support this association and demonstrate that maternal immune activation (MIA) changes brain morphology and inflammatory cytokines in the adult offspring. Evidence for changes in inflammatory cytokines is also demonstrated in human post-mortem brain and peripheral blood studies from subjects with psychiatric disorders. This perspective briefly highlights convincing evidence from epidemiological, preclinical and human pathological studies to support the role of MIA in major psychiatric disorders. A better understanding of the link between MIA and brain development in psychiatric disorders will lead to the development of novel immunomodulatory interventions for individuals at risk for psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Deficits in cognitive flexibility, the ability to modify behavior in response to changes in the environment, contribute to the onset and maintenance of stress-related neuropsychiatric illnesses, such as depression. Cognitive flexibility depends on medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) function, and in depressed patients, cognitive inflexibility is associated with hypoactivity and decreased glutamate receptor expression in the mPFC. Rats exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) exhibit compromised mPFC function on the extradimensional (ED) set-shifting task of the attentional set-shifting test. Moreover, CUS-induced ED deficits are associated with dendritic atrophy and decreased glutamate receptor expression in the mPFC. This evidence suggests that impaired glutamate signaling may underlie stress-induced deficits in cognitive flexibility. To test this hypothesis, we first demonstrated that blocking NMDA or AMPA receptors in the mPFC during ED replicated CUS-induced deficits in naïve rats. Secondly, we found that expression of activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) mRNA, a marker of behaviorally induced glutamate-mediated plasticity, was increased in the mPFC following ED. We then showed that CUS compromised excitatory afferent activation of the mPFC following pharmacological stimulation of the mediodorsal thalamus (MDT), indicated by a reduced induction of c-fos expression. Subsequently, in vivo recordings of evoked potentials in the mPFC indicated that CUS impaired afferent activation of the mPFC evoked by MDT stimulation, but not the ventral hippocampus. Lastly, glutamate microdialysis showed that CUS attenuated the acute stress-evoked increase in extracellular glutamate in the mPFC. Together, these results demonstrate that CUS-induced ED deficits are associated with compromised glutamate neurotransmission in the mPFC.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive condition affecting the central nervous system (CNS), and is characterized by the development of demyelinated lesions and plaques in the brain and spinal cord. Exercise is beneficial against dementia in elderly patients, so we investigated the effects of exercise on memory in relation to hippocampal demyelination and neuroplasticity in a mouse model of MS (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [EAE]). Mice were randomly divided into three groups: Sham, EAE, and EAE and exercise (EAE + EX). EAE + EX mice exercised five times a week for 4 weeks, and all mice performed step-down avoidance tasks in order to verify memory ability. We analyzed changes in myelin basic protein (MBP), 2′,3′-Cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (brdU), doublecortin (DCX), bcl-2, bax, TUNEL, caspase-3, and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) via immunoassay or histological staining. We found decreased memory ability in EAE mice, accompanied by impaired myelination, increased apoptosis and cell proliferation, and decreased BDNF in the hippocampus. The memory decline and changes in demyelination, apoptosis, BDNF, and cell proliferation were partially reversed in EAE + EX mice. Our findings suggest that in patients with MS, regular exercise may benefit cognitive function by rescuing some hippocampal cellular and molecular impairments.

AB  - Abstract
Inhalation of carbon dioxide (CO2) is frequently employed as a biological challenge to evoke intense fear and anxiety. In individuals with panic disorder, CO2 reliably evokes panic attacks. Sensitivity to CO2 is highly heterogeneous among individuals, and although a genetic component is implicated, underlying mechanisms are not clear. Preclinical models that can simulate differential responsivity to CO2 are therefore relevant. In the current study we investigated CO2-evoked behavioral responses in four different rat strains: Sprague–Dawley (SD), Wistar (W), Long Evans (LE) and Wistar-Kyoto, (WK) rats. We also assessed tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH-2)-positive serotonergic neurons in anxiety/panic regulatory subdivisions of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR), as well as dopamine β hydroxylase (DβH)-positive noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus, implicated in central CO2-chemosensitivity. Behavioral responsivity to CO2 inhalation varied between strains. CO2-evoked immobility was significantly higher in LE and WK rats as compared with W and SD cohorts. Differences were also observed in CO2-evoked rearing and grooming behaviors. Exposure to CO2 did not produce conditioned behavioral responses upon re-exposure to CO2 context in any strain. Reduced TPH-2-positive cell counts were observed specifically in the panic-regulatory dorsal raphe ventrolateral (DRVL)-ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (VLPAG) subdivision in CO2-sensitive strains. Conversely, DβH-positive cell counts within the LC were significantly higher in CO2-sensitive strains. Collectively, our data provide evidence for strain dependent, differential CO2-sensitivity and potential differences in monoaminergic systems regulating panic and anxiety. Comparative studies between CO2-vulnerable and resistant strains may facilitate the mechanistic understanding of differential CO2-sensitivity in the development of panic and anxiety disorders.

Although increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines has been linked to symptoms of alcoholism, few studies have evaluated whether cytokine expression changes across the development of alcohol dependence, or whether these changes are region and/or sex specific. In the present study, we subjected adult male and female rats to different regimens of alcohol vapor exposure (acute, subchronic, or chronic) and measured relative mRNA expression for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) in reward-related brain regions. Results indicated that acute alcohol exposure increased TNFα mRNA expression in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and ventral tegmental area (VTA), whereas IL-6 expression was increased in the VTA, NAc, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) only in males. After subchronic exposure (1 week daily intermittent exposure, 14 h on:10 h off), TNFα expression remained elevated in the BLA, NAc, and VTA, while IL-6 expression was reduced in the male vmPFC. Chronic alcohol exposure (6 week daily intermittent exposure, 14 h on: 10 h off) increased TNFα mRNA expression in the NAc and increased IL-6 mRNA in the vmPFC and NAc. Interestingly, chronic alcohol exposure also robustly increased CCL2 mRNA expression in the BLA and VTA in males but not females. Thus, alcohol vapor exposure elicits sex-, region-, and duration-specific cytokine alterations that may contribute to differences in the manifestation and progression of symptoms of alcohol dependence in male and female populations.

AB  - Abstract
The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) regulator chaperone (NACHO) was recently identified as an important regulator of nAChR maturation and surface expression. Here we show that NACHO levels decrease during early postnatal development in rats. This decrease occurs earlier and to a greater degree in the frontal cortex (FC) compared with the hippocampus (HIP). We further show that rats exposed to nicotine during pre- and postnatal development exhibit significantly higher NACHO levels in the FC at postnatal day (PND) 21, but not at PND60. Repeated exposure to nicotine selectively during early (PND8–14) or late (PND54–60) postnatal stages did not affect NACHO protein levels in the FC or HIP, neither did exposure to high doses of the selective α7 nAChR agonists SSR180711, A-582941, or PNU-282987. However, we found significantly increased NACHO protein levels in the FC of PND36 rats after a single exposure to a combination of nicotine and the type II α7 nAChR positive allosteric modulator (PAM) PNU-120596, but not the type I PAM AVL-3288. These findings suggest that exposure to nAChR agonism affects NACHO protein levels, and that this effect is more pronounced during pre- or early postnatal development. The effect of PNU-120596 further suggests that the increase in NACHO expression is caused by activation rather than desensitization of nAChRs.

AB  - Abstract
To categorize the perceived objects, brain utilizes a broad set of its resources and encoding strategies. Yet, it remains elusive how the category information is encoded in the brain. While many classical studies have sought the category information in the across-trial-averaged activity of neurons/neural populations, several recent studies have observed category information also in the within-trial correlated variability of activities between neural populations (i.e. dependent variability). Moreover, other studies have observed that independent variability of activity, which is the variability of the measured neural activity without any influence from correlated variability with other neurons/populations, could also be modulated for improved categorization. However, it was unknown how important each of the three factors (i.e. average activity, dependent and independent variability of activities) was in category encoding. Therefore, we designed an EEG experiment in which human subjects viewed a set of object exemplars from four categories. Using a computational model, we evaluated the contribution of each factor separately in category encoding. Results showed that the average activity played a significant role while the independent variability, although effective, contributed moderately to the category encoding. The inter-channel dependent variability showed an ignorable effect on the encoding. We also investigated the role of those factors in the encoding of variations which showed similar effects. These results imply that the brain, rather than variability, seems to use the average activity to convey information on the category of the perceived objects.

AB  - Abstract
Evidences have been provided of a crucial role of multimodal audio-visuomotor processing in subserving the musical ability. In this paper we investigated whether musical audiovisual stimulation might trigger the activation of motor information in the brain of professional pianists, due to the presence of permanent gestures/sound associations. At this aim EEG was recorded in 24 pianists and naive participants engaged in the detection of rare targets while watching hundreds of video clips showing a pair of hands in the act of playing, along with a compatible or incompatible piano soundtrack. Hands size and apparent distance allowed self-ownership and agency illusions, and therefore motor simulation. Event-related potentials (ERPs) and relative source reconstruction showed the presence of an Error-related negativity (ERN) to incongruent trials at anterior frontal scalp sites, only in pianists, with no difference in naïve participants. ERN was mostly explained by an anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) source. Other sources included “hands” IT regions, the superior temporal gyrus (STG) involved in conjoined auditory and visuomotor processing, SMA and cerebellum (representing and controlling motor subroutines), and regions involved in body parts representation (somatosensory cortex, uncus, cuneus and precuneus). The findings demonstrate that instrument-specific audiovisual stimulation is able to trigger error shooting and correction neural responses via motor resonance and mirroring, being a possible aid in learning and rehabilitation.

AB  - Abstract
Stress-induced neural injuries are closely linked to the pathogenesis of various neuropsychiatric disorders and psychosomatic diseases. We and others have previously demonstrated certain protective effects of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) in stress-induced cerebral impairments, but the underlying protective mechanisms still remain poorly elucidated. Here we provide evidence to support the possible involvement of PKCα and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathways in EGCG-mediated protection against restraint stress-induced neural injuries in rats. In both open-field and step-through behavioral tests, the restraint stress-induced neuronal impairments were significantly ameliorated by administration of EGCG or green tea polyphenols (GTPs), which was associated with a partial restoration of normal plasma glucocorticoid, dopamine and serotonin levels. Furthermore, the stress-induced decrease of PKCα and ERK1/2 expression and phosphorylation was significantly attenuated by EGCG and to a less extent by GTP administration. Additionally, EGCG supplementation restored the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and the expression of a key regulator of cellular energy metabolism, the peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), in stressed animals. In conclusion, PKCα and ERK1/2 signaling pathways as well as PGC-1α-mediated ATP production might be involved in EGCG-mediated protection against stress-induced neural injuries.

Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been suggested as a therapeutic technique for treating patients with disorder of consciousness (DOC). Although studies have reported its benefits for patients, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. The aim of this study was to measure the effects of SCS on the EEG of patients in a minimally conscious state (MCS), which would allow us to explore the possible workings underpinning of the approach. Resting state EEG was recorded before and immediately after SCS, using various frequencies (5 Hz, 20 Hz, 50 Hz, 70 Hz and 100 Hz), for 11 patients in MCS. Relative power, coherence, S-estimator and bicoherence were calculated to assess the EEG changes. Five frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma) and three regions (frontal, central and posterior) were divided in the calculation. The main findings of this study were that: (1) significantly altered relative power and synchronisation was found in delta and gamma bands after one SCS stimulation using 5 Hz, 70 Hz or 100 Hz; (2) bicoherence showed that coupling within delta was significantly decreased after stimulation using 70 Hz, while reduction of coupling between delta and gamma was found when using 5 Hz and 100 Hz. However, SCS of 20 Hz, 50 Hz and sham stimulation did not induce changes in any frequency band at any region. This study showed EEG evidence that SCS can modulate the brain function of MCS patients, speculatively by activating the formation-thalamus-cortex network.

AB  - Abstract
Cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) has an important role in brain diseases such as stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, migraine with aura, and epilepsy. Several anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are used to treat paroxysmal brain diseases and are thus known to suppress CSD. One of these AEDs is gabapentin (GBP) which has been traditionally used for treatment of some CSD-related neurological diseases. We applied intra- and extracellular recordings to investigate the effect of CSD on inhibitory post synaptic potentials (IPSPs) and synaptic properties of rodent neocortex after application of GBP. Application of GBP after CSD increased the amplitude of IPSPs. In addition, GBP inhibited induction of long-term potentiation after CSD. These data support an effect of GBP on GABA-mediated inhibition in the late hyperexcitable phase of CSD. Modulations of synaptic properties and post-CSD GABAergic function are likely GBP’s mechanisms of action in CSD-related disorders. These mechanisms could be targeted for further drug discovery in CSD-related diseases.

Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) signaling through CRF receptor 1 (CRFR1) regulates autonomic, endocrine and behavioral responses to stress and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of several disorders including anxiety, depression, and addiction. Using a validated CRFR1 reporter mouse line (bacterial artificial chromosome identified by green fluorescence protein (BAC GFP-CRFR1)), we investigated the distribution of CRFR1 in the developing mouse forebrain. Distribution of CRFR1 was investigated at postnatal days (P) 0, 4, and 21 in male and female mice. CRFR1 increased with age in several regions including the medial amygdala, arcuate nucleus, paraventricular hypothalamus, medial septum, CA1 hippocampal area, and the lateral habenula. Regions showing decreased CRFR1 expression with increased age include the intermediate portion of the periventricular hypothalamic nucleus, and CA3 hippocampal area. We report a sexually dimorphic expression of CRFR1 within the rostral portion of the anteroventral periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (AVPV/PeN), a region known to regulate ovulation, reproductive and maternal behaviors. Females had a greater number of CRFR1-GFP-ir cells at all time points in the AVPV/PeN and CRFR1-GFP-ir was nearly absent in males by P21. Overall, alterations in CRFR1-GFP-ir distribution based on age and sex may contribute to observed age- and sex-dependent differences in stress regulation.

Previous studies have shown a close relationship between the serotonin system and working memory (WM), but the neural mechanism for the role of the serotonin system on the WM is unclear. The frontoparietal network is involved in WM and is associated with the serotonin system. Therefore, this study investigated the interaction effect of the serotonin transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) and the polymorphism in the serotonin 1A receptor gene (rs6295) on the frontoparietal network obtained from the independent component analysis in a large, young Chinese sample population. The current study found a significant interaction effect of 5-HTTLPR and rs6295 on the connectivity within the right frontoparietal network, specifically in the middle frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule. Moreover, the mean connectivity in the right inferior parietal lobule was positively correlated with WM performance. These brain network analysis findings could provide a new perspective on the neural mechanisms of gene–gene interactions and on individual differences in cognitive functions.

Brain iron accumulation is a common feature shared by several neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson’s disease. However, what produces this accumulation of iron is still unknown. In this study, the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) hemi-parkinsonian rat model was used to investigate abnormal iron accumulation in substantia nigra. We investigated three possible causes of iron accumulation; a compromised blood–brain barrier (BBB), abnormal expression of ferritin, and neuroinflammation. We identified alterations in the BBB subsequent to the injection of 6-OHDA using gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Moreover, detection of extravasated IgG suggested that peripheral components are able to enter the brain through a leaky BBB. Presence of iron following dopamine cell degeneration was studied by MRI, which revealed hypointense signals in the substantia nigra. The presence of iron deposits was further validated in histological evaluations. Furthermore, iron inclusions were closely associated with active microglia and with increased levels of L-ferritin indicating a putative role for microglia and L-ferritin in brain iron accumulation and dopamine neurodegeneration.

AB  - Abstract
Ski, as an evolutionarily conserved protein, is a versatile transcriptional regulator which widely distributes in various tissues and species. Recently, we have demonstrated for the first time that Ski was strikingly up-regulated in reactive astrocytes after spinal cord injury (SCI) in vivo, which indicates that maybe Ski is a new molecule that controls astrocytes’ biological properties after SCI. However, the accurate distributions and functions of Ski in astrocytes after central nervous system (CNS) injury are still unclear. Astrocytes were collected from rats’ cerebral cortex. To elucidate the expression and role of Ski in reactive astrocytes, we performed an activated astrocytes model induced by LPS and scratch injury in vitro. Our results showed that Ski gradually increased and reached a peak at 4 days, then declined at 6 days after induction by LPS. Up-regulation of Ski was accompanied with the increase in proliferation-related proteins including PCNA, CDK4 and CyclinD1. Furthermore, immunofluorescent staining analysis also demonstrated a highly positive relationship between Ski and GFAP, PCNA in astrocytes. These results indicated that Ski might play an important role in astrocyte proliferation. To further explore the role of Ski, astrocytes were transfected with Ski-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA). We found that the primary activated astrocytes’ proliferation decreased significantly after transfection with Ski-specific siRNA. Surprisingly, Ski knockdown also weakened the primary astrocyte migration. Based on the above, we could conclude that Ski might play a crucial role in astrocyte proliferation and migration. This discovery might contribute to a promising therapeutic intervention in CNS injury.

AB  - Abstract
Resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) is frequently used as a powerful technology to detect individual differences in many cognitive functions. Recently, some studies have explored the association between scale-free dynamic properties of resting-state brain activation and individual personality traits. However, little is known about whether the scale-free dynamics of resting-state function networks is associated with delay discounting. To address this question, we calculated the Hurst exponent which quantifies long-term memory of the time series in resting-state networks (RSNs) identified via independent component analysis (ICA) and examined what relationship between delay discounting and the Hurst exponent of RSNs is. ICA results showed that entire nine RSNs were successfully recognized and extracted from independent components. After controlling some covariates, including gender, age, education, personality and trait anxiety, partial correlation analysis revealed that the Hurst exponent in default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN) was positively correlated with the delay discounting rates. No significant correlation between delay discounting and mean Hurst exponent of the whole brain was found. Thus, our results suggest the individual delay discounting is associated with the dynamics of inner-network interactions in the DMN and SN, and highlight the crucial role of scale-free dynamic properties of function networks on intertemporal choice.

AB  - Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent disorder of senile dementia mainly characterized by amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) deposits in the brain. Cannabinoids are relevant to AD as they exert several beneficial effects in many models of this disease. Still, whether the endocannabinoid system is either up- or down-regulated in AD has not yet been fully elucidated. Thus, the aim of the present paper was to analyze endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) metabolism in cerebral cortex synaptosomes incubated with Aβ oligomers or fibrils. These Aβ conformations were obtained by “aging” the 1-40 fragment of the peptide under different agitation and time conditions. A diminished availability of 2-AG resulting from a significant decrease in diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) activity was observed in the presence of large Aβ1-40 oligomers along with synaptosomal membrane damage, as judged by transmission electron microscopy and LDH release. Conversely, a high availability of 2-AG resulting from an increase in DAGL and lysophosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase activities occurred in the presence of Aβ1-40 fibrils although synaptosomal membrane disruption was also observed. Interestingly, neither synaptosomal mitochondrial viability assayed by MTT reduction nor membrane lipid peroxidation assayed by TBARS formation measurements were altered by Aβ1-40 oligomers or fibrils. These results show a differential effect of Aβ1-40 peptide on 2-AG metabolism depending on its conformation.

AB  - Abstract
Visceral pain in inflammatory and functional gastrointestinal conditions is a major clinical problem. The exact mechanisms underlying the development of pain, during and after visceral inflammation are unknown. However, clinical and pre-clinical evidence suggests plasticity within the spinal cord dorsal horn is a contributing factor. Here we use an in vivo preparation and patch-clamp electrophysiology to test whether the synaptic and intrinsic properties of superficial dorsal horn (SDH) neurons are altered 5 days after the induction of mild colitis in adult male mice (i.e. during acute inflammation of the colon). Whole-cell recordings were made from lumbosacral (L6-S1) superficial dorsal horn neurons (SDH), in animals under isoflurane anesthesia. Noxious colorectal distension (CRD) was used to identify SDH neurons with colonic inputs, while stimulation of the hind paw and tail was employed to assess convergent cutaneous input. Following inflammation, a significantly increased proportion of SDH neurons received both colonic and cutaneous inputs, compared to neurons in naïve animals. In addition, the nature and magnitude of responses to CRD and cutaneous stimulation differed in inflamed animals, as was spontaneous excitatory synaptic drive. Conversely, several measures of intrinsic excitability were altered in a manner that would decrease SDH network excitability following colitis. We propose that during inflammation, sensitization of colonic afferents results in increased signaling to the SDH. This is accompanied by plasticity in SDH neurons whereby their intrinsic properties are changed to compensate for altered afferent activity.

AB  - Abstract
The fact that interference from peripheral distracting information can be reduced in high perceptual load tasks has been widely demonstrated in previous research. The modulation from the perceptual load is known as perceptual load effect (PLE). Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies on perceptual load have reported the brain areas implicated in attentional control. To date, the contribution of attentional control to PLE and the relationship between the organization of functional connectivity and PLE are still poorly understood. In the present study, we used resting-state fMRI to explore the association between the voxel-wise degree centrality (DC) and PLE in an individual differences design and further investigated the potential resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) contributing to individual’s PLE. DC-PLE correlation analysis revealed that PLE was positively associated with the right middle temporal visual area (MT)—one of dorsal attention network (DAN) nodes. Furthermore, the right MT functionally connected to the conventional DAN and the RSFCs between right MT and DAN nodes were also positively associated with individual difference in PLE. The results suggest an important role of attentional control in perceptual load tasks and provide novel insights into the understanding of the neural correlates underlying PLE.

AB  - Abstract
Hyperexcitability is hypothesized to contribute to the degeneration of spinal motoneurons (MNs) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Studies, thus far, have not linked hyperexcitability to the intrinsic properties of MNs in the adult ALS mouse model with the G93A-mutated SOD1 protein (mSOD1G93A). In this study, we obtained two types of measurements: ventral root recordings to assess motor output and intracellular recordings to assess synaptic properties of individual MNs. All studies were carried out in an in vitro preparation of the sacral spinal cords of mSOD1G93A mice and their non-transgenic (NT) littermates, both in the age range of 50–90 days. Ventral root recordings revealed that maximum compound action potentials (coAPs) evoked by a short-train stimulation of corresponding dorsal roots were similar between the two types of mice. Although the progressive depression of coAPs was present during the train stimulation in all recordings, the coAP depression in mSOD1G93A mice was to a lesser extent, which suggests an increased firing tendency in mSOD1G93A MNs. Intracellular recordings showed no changes in fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in mSOD1G93A MNs. However, recording did show that oscillating EPSPs (oEPSPs) were induced by poly-EPSPs at a higher frequency and by less-intense electrical stimulation in mSOD1G93A MNs. These oEPSPs were dependent upon the activities of spinal network and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), and were subjected to riluzole modulation. Taken together, these findings revealed abnormal electrophysiology in mSOD1G93A MNs that could underlie ALS excitotoxicity.

AB  - Abstract
The locomotor central pattern generator is a neural network located in the ventral aspect of the caudal spinal cord that underlies stepping in mammals. While many genetically defined interneurons that are thought to comprise this neural network have been identified and characterized, the dI6 cells- which express the transcription factors WT1 and/or DMRT3- are one population that settle in this region, are active during locomotion, whose function is poorly understood. These cells were originally hypothesized to be commissural premotor interneurons, however evidence in support of this is sparse. Here we characterize this population of cells using the TgDbx1Cre;R26EFP;Dbx1LacZ transgenic mouse line, which has been shown to be an effective marker of dI6 interneurons. We show dI6 cells to be abundant in laminae VII and VIII along the entire spinal cord and provide evidence that subtypes outside the WT1/DMRT3 expressing dI6 cells may exist. Retrograde tracing experiments indicate that the majority of dI6 cells project descending axons, and some make monosynaptic or disynaptic contacts onto motoneurons on either side of the spinal cord. Analysis of their activity during non-resetting deletions, which occur during bouts of fictive locomotion, suggests that these cells are involved in both locomotor rhythm generation and pattern formation. This study provides a thorough characterization of the dI6 cells labeled in the TgDbx1Cre;R26EFP;Dbx1LacZ transgenic mouse, and supports previous work suggesting that these cells play multiple roles during locomotor activity.

AB  - Abstract
The dysregulation of posttranslational modifications of the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) tau plays a key role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related disorders. Thus, we have previously shown that beta amyloid (Aβ)-induced neurotoxicity was mediated, at least in part, by tau cleavage into the tau45-230 fragment. However, the mechanisms underlying the toxicity of tau45-230 remain unknown. To get insights into such mechanisms, we first determined the subcellular localization of this tau fragment in hippocampal neurons. Tau45-230 was easily detectable in cell bodies and processes extended by these neurons. In addition, cell extraction experiments performed using Triton X-100 and saponin showed that a pool of tau45-230 was associated with the cytoskeleton and the cytoskeleton plus membrane-bound organelles, respectively, in cultured hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, they suggested that these associations were independent of the presence of full-length tau. We also assessed whether this tau fragment could alter axonal transport. Our results indicated that tau45-230 significantly reduced the number of organelles transported along hippocampal axons. This altered axonal transport did not correlate with changes in the total number of organelles present in these cells or in motor protein levels. Together these results suggested that tau45-230 could exert its toxic effects by partially blocking axonal transport along microtubules thus contributing to the early pathology of AD.

AB  - Abstract
The mammillary body (MB) and the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) are closely related structures, which take part in learning and memory processes. However, the exact role of these structures has remained unclear. In both structures neurons firing according to hippocampal theta rhythm have been found, mainly in the medial mammillary nucleus (MM) and anteroventral thalamic nucleus (AV). These neurons are driven by descending projections from the hippocampal formation and are thought to convey theta rhythm back to the hippocampus (HP). We argue that the MB–ATN axis not only relays theta signal, but may also modulate it. To examine it, we performed a pharmacological inactivation of the MM and AV by local infusion of procaine, and measured changes in theta activity in selected structures of the extended hippocampal system in urethane-anesthetized rats. The inactivation of the MM resulted in decrease in EEG power in the HP and AV, the most evidently in the lower theta frequency bands, i.e. 3–5 Hz in the HP (down to 9.2% in 3- to 4-Hz band and 37.6% in 4- to 5-Hz band, in comparison to the power in the control conditions) and 3–4 Hz in the AV (down to 24.9%). After the AV inactivation, hippocampal EEG power decreased in theta frequency bands of 3–8 Hz (down to 61.6% in 6- to 7-Hz band and 69.4% in 7- to 8-Hz band). Our results suggest that the role of the MB–ATN axis in regulating theta rhythm signaling may be much more important than has been speculated so far.

AB  - Abstract
The basal forebrain cholinergic pathways progressively degenerate during the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, leading to an irreversible impairment of memory and thinking skills. The stereotaxic lesion with 192IgG-saporin in the rat brain has been used to eliminate basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and is aimed at emulating the cognitive damage described in this disease in order to explore its effects on behavior and on neurotransmission. Learning and memory processes that are controlled by cholinergic neurotransmission are also modulated by the endocannabinoid (eCB) system. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the eCB signaling in relation to the memory impairment induced in adult rats following a specific cholinergic lesion of the basal forebrain. Therefore, CB1 receptor-mediated signaling was analyzed using receptor and functional autoradiography, and cellular distribution by immunofluorescence. The passive avoidance test and histochemical data revealed a relationship between impaired behavioral responses and a loss of approximately 75% of cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM), accompanied by cortical cholinergic denervation. The decrease in CB1 receptor density observed in the hippocampus, together with hyperactivity of eCB signaling in the NBM and cortex, suggest an interaction between the eCB and cholinergic systems. Moreover, following basal forebrain cholinergic denervation, the presynaptic GABAergic immunoreactivity was reduced in cortical areas. In conclusion, CB1 receptors present in presynaptic GABAergic terminals in the hippocampus are down regulated, but not those in cortical glutamatergic synapses.

AB  - Abstract
The post-stroke angiogenic response is accompanied by changes of tight junctions (TJs) of the blood–brain barrier (BBB). However, the precise dynamic change of TJ proteins (TJPs) in the different stages of stroke-induced vascular remodeling and the molecules mediating these processes have yet to be fully defined. To investigate the temporal relationship between changes in TJPs, the pro-angiogenic factor α5β1 integrin and the anti-permeability factor Ang1 in cerebral vessels following cerebral ischemic stroke, male C57Bl/6 mice were subject to 90 min of ischemia by temporary occlusion of the middle cerebral artery followed by reperfusion and their brains analyzed 0, 1, 2, 4, 7 and 14 days post-ischemia. Immunofluorescent studies demonstrated that in the ischemic penumbra, TJPs claudin-5 and ZO-1 levels decreased during the early stages of vascular remodeling, but then increased in the later stages. In contrast, within the ischemic core, TJPs levels decreased over the 14-day time-course, plateaued at day 4, and remained at low levels up to day 14. In the penumbra, Ang1 expression was induced, peaking at the same time point as α5β1 expression. Consistent with these findings, oxygen glucose deprivation/reperfusion induced expression of α5β1 and Ang1 on brain endothelial cell (BEC) in a similar manner in vitro, which correlated closely with BEC proliferation and increased expression of TJPs. Our results demonstrate that in the post-ischemic penumbra, a tight temporal correlation exists between the angiogenic markers α5β1 and Ang1 and the TJPs, suggesting a potential role for Ang1 and α5β1 in promoting BBB integrity following ischemic stroke.

Primary visual cortex, the first cortical stage of visual information processing, is represented by diverse functional maps that demonstrate the selectivity for specific visual features such as spatial frequency (SF). Although the local organization of SF maps in cat area 17 (A17) has been largely investigated, the global arrangement remains elusive. To address this unclear aspect, we evaluated the organization of SF maps within A17 by intrinsic signal optical imaging and extracellular electrophysiological recording. Our results explicitly showed that SF organization in cat A17 displayed a global asymmetrical unimodal distribution. In particular, we found the highest SF preference within the global distribution concentrated around the horizontal meridian. These results significantly contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the SF organization in visual cortex.

Despite recent progress on neural pathways underlying individual behaviors, how an animal balances and prioritizes behavioral outputs remains poorly understood. While studying the relationship between hunger-induced feeding and pup-induced maternal behaviors in virgin female mice, we made the unexpected discovery that presence of pups strongly delayed and decreased food consumption. Strikingly, presence of pups also suppressed feeding induced by optogenetic activation of Agrp neurons. Such a suppressive effect inversely correlated with the extents of maternal behaviors, but did not rely on the display of these behaviors, and was also present in virgin males. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of Vglut2+ neurons in the medial preoptic area (mPOA), a region critical for maternal behaviors and motivation, was sufficient to suppress hunger-induced feeding. However, muscimol inhibition of the mPOA, while disrupting maternal behaviors, did not prevent pup suppression of feeding, indicating that neural pathways in other brain regions may also mediate such an effect. Together, these results provide novel insights into neural coordination of pup care and feeding in mice and organizations of animal behaviors in general.

AB  - Abstract
Although deep-brain stimulation (DBS) of the lateral habenula (LHb) has been successfully applied to treatment-resistant depression for years, the mechanism is still unclear. Previous researches have demonstrated that LHb-DBS elevates brain monoamine neurotransmitters. However, these changes do not account for the treatment efficacy on treatment-resistant depression, or the rapid behavioral effects in rats; the evidence suggests that altered synaptic potentiation may contribute to the treatment effects. We applied LHb-DBS in a rat model of learned helplessness (LH) and analyzed mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation. We also assessed related electrophysiological changes after LHb-DBS in vitro. LHb-DBS reversed depression-like behaviors in sucrose preference and forced swim tests in rats with LH. Additionally, mTOR phosphorylation significantly increased and field population excitatory postsynaptic potentials increased in the hippocampus. These effects were blocked by the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel (L-VDCC) antagonist, nifedipine. Furthermore, in vitro LHb-DBS increased both the frequency and width of spontaneous spikes generated by CA1 pyramidal neurons, which contribute to Ca2+ influx through L-VDCC. Our findings suggest that L-VDCC-mediated synaptic potentiation underlies the antidepressant effects of LHb-DBS, and suggest that astrocytic regulation of Ca2+ influx and associated synaptic changes maybe novel targets for developing antidepressant treatments.

AB  - Abstract
Amyloid-β (Aβ) production and clearance in the brain is a crucial focus of investigations into the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. Imbalance between production and clearance leads to accumulation of Aβ. The important Aβ-degrading enzymes in the brain are neprilysin (NEP) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), and defective enzyme expression may facilitate Aβ deposition in sporadic late-onset AD patients. It has been suggested that epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a member of the catechin family, might be an effective treatment for AD, because it has been shown to elevate NEP expression. Therefore, we examined whether catechins, which are functional components of common foods, could regulate the degradation of Aβ by inducing NEP and IDE expression. We also investigated the role of catechins in activating intracellular signal transduction in astrocytes. Treatment of cultured rat astrocytes with EGCG significantly reduced the expression of NEP, but not IDE, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. NEP expression in cultured astrocytes was suppressed by activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and reduced NEP expression was accompanied by an increase of NEP release into the extracellular space (culture medium). Moreover, culture medium from EGCG-treated astrocytes facilitated the degradation of exogenous Aβ. These results suggest that EGCG may have a beneficial effect on AD by activating ERK-and PI3K-mediated pathways in astrocytes, thus increasing astrocyte secretion of NEP and facilitating degradation of Aβ.

AB  - Abstract
Recent data suggest that manipulating the muscle afferents of one arm affects both ipsilateral and contralateral perceptual estimates. Here, we used the mirror paradigm to study the bimanual integration of kinesthetic muscle afferents. The reflection of a moving hand in a mirror positioned in the sagittal plane creates an illusion of symmetrical bimanual movement. Although vision clearly has a role in kinesthesia, its role in the mirror illusion might have been overestimated. Conversely, the role of bimanual integration of muscle afferents might have been underestimated. We hypothesized that muscle-proprioceptive afferents of the passively displaced arm (the image of which was reflected in the mirror) are involved in this illusion. We evoked in 19 healthy adult participants the mirror illusion by displacing passively their left arm, the image of which was reflected in the mirror. Once participants experienced the illusion that their hidden right arm was moving, we then either occluded their view of the mirror (using occlusive glasses) and/or prevent the passive left arm displacement. Participants’ illusion characteristics (duration and kinematic) under these conditions were compared with classical mirror illusion (without visual occlusion). We found that as long as the arm was still moving, the kinesthetic illusion decayed slowly after visual occlusion. These findings suggest that the mirror illusion results from the combination of visuo-proprioceptive signals from the two arms and is not purely visual in origin. Our findings also support the more general concept whereby proprioceptive afferents are integrated bilaterally for the purpose of kinesthesia during bimanual tasks.

AB  - Abstract
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common brain disorder with high prevalence in school-age children. Previously developed machine learning-based methods have discriminated patients with ADHD from normal controls by providing label information of the disease for individuals. Inattention and impulsivity are the two most significant clinical symptoms of ADHD. However, predicting clinical symptoms (i.e., inattention and impulsivity) is a challenging task based on neuroimaging data. The goal of this study is twofold: to build predictive models for clinical symptoms of ADHD based on resting-state fMRI and to mine brain networks for predictive patterns of inattention and impulsivity. To achieve this goal, a cohort of 74 boys with ADHD and a cohort of 69 age-matched normal controls were recruited from the ADHD-200 Consortium. Both structural and resting-state fMRI images were obtained for each participant. Temporal patterns between and within intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) were applied as raw features in the predictive models. Specifically, sample entropy was taken as an intra-ICN feature, and phase synchronization (PS) was used as an inter-ICN feature. The predictive models were based on the least absolute shrinkage and selectionator operator (LASSO) algorithm. The performance of the predictive model for inattention is r = 0.79 (p &lt; 10−8), and the performance of the predictive model for impulsivity is r = 0.48 (p &lt; 10−8). The ICN-related predictive patterns may provide valuable information for investigating the brain network mechanisms of ADHD. In summary, the predictive models for clinical symptoms could be beneficial for personalizing ADHD medications.

AB  - Abstract
Alcoholism is a relapsing disorder with limited treatment options, in part due to our limited understanding of the disease etiology. We have recently shown that increased ethanol-seeking in a behavioral model of relapse in a rat model of alcoholism was associated with increased oligodendrogenesis which was positively correlated with platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1) expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The current study investigated whether newly born oligodendrocytes form close physical associations with endothelial cells expressing PECAM-1 and whether these changes were accompanied by altered blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Colableling and confocal analysis demonstrate that newly born oligodendroglia were always located in close physical proximity to PECAM-1 in the mPFC of rats that were ethanol dependent and demonstrated high propensity for relapse. Notably, the endothelial proximity of new oligodendrocytes was associated with reduced expression of endothelial barrier antigen (SMI-71), a marker for BBB integrity. Furthermore, voluntary wheel running during abstinence enhanced SMI-71 expression in endothelial cells, indicating protection against abstinence-induced reduction in BBB integrity. Taken together, these results suggest that ethanol experience and abstinence disrupts homeostasis in the oligo-vascular niche in the mPFC. Reversing these mechanisms may hold the key to reducing propensity for relapse in individuals with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder.

AB  - AbstractBackground
Neuregulin-1β (NRG-1β) has great potential to be developed into therapeutics for neuroprotection. The aim of the current study was to analyze the effects and possible signaling pathway of NRG-1β on brain tissues in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R).
Methods
In order to observe the protective effect of NRG-1β on MCAO/R, the neurological deficit and infarct volume were measured using a modified neurological severity score (mNSS) test and by triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. In order to detect the antagonistic effect of NRG-1β on nerve cells and the blood–brain barrier (BBB), the morphology and structure of cortical brain tissues were observed by Evans Blue (EB) staining, hematoxylin–eosin (H&amp;E) and Nissl staining, in situ cell death detection kit, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In order to investigate whether NRG-1β exhibited a significant neuroprotective effect via the JNK signaling pathway, the activity of JNK and the levels of phospho-MKK4, phospho-JNK, pan-JNK and phospho-c-Jun were tested using a JNK activity screening kit, immunofluorescent labeling, and western blot analysis, respectively.
Results
In the NRG-1β treatment group, accompanied with a decrease in JNK activity, the protein levels of phospho-JNK, phospho-MKK4 and phospho-c-Jun decreased, the ischemia-induced apoptosis decreased, the abnormal morphological structures of nerve cells were ameliorated, the integrity of the BBB was restored, and infarct volume was reduced. At the same time, neurological function was significantly recovered.
Conclusion
NRG-1β exerts a neuroprotective effect through the JNK signaling pathway in MCAO/R rats.

AB  - Abstract
Studies have indicated that a cortical sensory system is capable of processing information from different sensory modalities. However, it still remains unclear when and how a cortical system integrates and retains information across sensory modalities during learning. Here we investigated the neural dynamics underlying crossmodal associations and memory by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) when human participants performed visuo-tactile (crossmodal) and visuo-visual (unimodal) paired-associate (PA) learning tasks. In a trial of the tasks, the participants were required to explore and learn the relationship (paired or non-paired) between two successive stimuli. EEG recordings revealed dynamic ERP changes during participants’ learning of paired-associations. Specifically, (1) the frontal N400 component showed learning-related changes in both unimodal and crossmodal tasks but did not show any significant difference between these two tasks, while the central P400 displayed both learning changes and task differences; (2) a late posterior negative slow wave (LPN) showed the learning effect only in the crossmodal task; (3) alpha-band oscillations appeared to be involved in crossmodal working memory. Additional behavioral experiments suggested that these ERP components were not relevant to the participants’ familiarity with stimuli per se. Further, by shortening the delay length (from 1300 ms to 400 ms or 200 ms) between the first and second stimulus in the crossmodal task, declines in participants’ task performance were observed accordingly. Taken together, these results provide insights into the cortical plasticity (induced by PA learning) of neural networks involved in crossmodal associations in working memory.

AB  - Abstract
Trauma and tumor compressing the brain distort underlying cortical neurons. Compressed cortical neurons remodel their dendrites instantly. The effects on axons however remain unclear. Using a rat epidural bead implantation model, we studied the effects of unilateral somatosensory cortical compression on its transcallosal projection and the reversibility of the changes following decompression. Compression reduced the density, branching profuseness and boutons of the projection axons in the contralateral homotopic cortex 1 week and 1 month post-compression. Projection fiber density was higher 1-month than 1-week post-compression, suggesting adaptive temporal changes. Compression reduced contralateral cortical synaptophysin, vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD95) expressions in a week and the first two marker proteins further by 1 month. βIII-tubulin and kinesin light chain (KLC) expressions in the corpus callosum (CC) where transcallosal axons traveled were also decreased. Kinesin heavy chain (KHC) level in CC was temporarily increased 1 week after compression. Decompression increased transcallosal axon density and branching profuseness to higher than sham while bouton density returned to sham levels. This was accompanied by restoration of synaptophysin, VGLUT1 and PSD95 expressions in the contralateral cortex of the 1-week, but not the 1-month, compression rats. Decompression restored βIII-tubulin, but not KLC and KHC expressions in CC. However, KLC and KHC expressions in the cell bodies of the layer II/III pyramidal neurons partially recovered. Our results show cerebral compression compromised cortical axonal outputs and reduced transcallosal projection. Some of these changes did not recover in long-term decompression.

AB  - Abstract
Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC) are glial cells that differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes during early stages of post-natal life. However, OPCs persist beyond developmental myelination and represent an important population of cycling cells in the gray and white matter of the adult brain. While adult OPCs form unique territories that are maintained through self-avoidance, some cortical OPCs appear to position their cell body very close to that of a neuron, forming what are known as OPC–neuron pairs. We used unbiased systematic stereological analysis of the NG2-CreERTM:EYFP reporter mouse to determine that close to 170,000 OPC–neuron pairs can be found in the dorsal portion of the adult neocortex, with approximately 40% of OPCs and 4% of neurons in pairs. Through stereological analysis, we also determined that reference memory training does not change the prevalence of OPC–neuron pairs or the proportion of OPCs and neurons that form them. GABAergic agent administration did not affect the proportion of OPCs and neurons that can be found in pairs. However, the GABAB-receptor agonist baclofen and the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin significantly increased the estimated number of pairs when compared to the control group and the GABAB-receptor antagonist (i.e. saclofen) group. Density of OPC–neuron pairs was increased by the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin. Finally, histological analysis of OPC–neuron pairs suggested that in the dorsal portion of the cortex, GABAergic interneurons represent the most common neuronal component of the pairs, and that calbindin, calretinin and parvalbumin GABAergic interneurons found in the cortex take part in these pairs. Using previous estimates of the number of GABAergic neurons in the rodent cortex, we estimate that roughly one in four GABAergic neurons are paired with an OPC.

Patients sometimes complain that non-vital teeth after root canal treatment (RCT) are paresthesia compared with vital teeth, and previous psychological studies on the tactile sensibility of non-vital teeth remained controversial. In the present study, intrinsic signal optical imaging, which served as an objective tool, was employed to compare the cortex response characteristics following forces applied to the cat non-vital and vital canines. Based on the evoked cortical responses, the response threshold, signal strength, spatial pattern, temporal dynamics and the preference of force direction, they were not significantly different between vital and non-vital canines. It seemed that the tactile sensibility of vital and non-vital teeth was comparable at the cortical response level, and pulpal receptors were not concerned in tactile function.

AB  - Abstract
The effects of cannabinoids are primarily mediated by type-1 cannabinoid receptors in the brain and type-2 cannabinoid receptors (CB2Rs) in the peripheral immune system. However, recent evidence demonstrates that CB2Rs are also expressed in the brain and implicated in neuropsychiatric effects. Diverse types of cells in various regions in the brain express CB2Rs but the cellular loci of CB2Rs that induce specific behavioral effects have not been determined. To manipulate CB2R expression in specific types of cells in the dorsal hippocampus of adult mice, we used Cre-dependent overexpression and CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing techniques in combination with adeno-associated viruses and transgenic mice. Elevation and disruption of CB2R expression in microglia in the CA1 area increased and decreased, respectively, contextual fear memory. In CA1 pyramidal neurons, disruption of CB2R expression enhanced spatial working memory, whereas their overexpression reduced anxiety levels assessed as an increase in the exploration time in the central area of open field. Interneuronal CB2Rs were not involved in the modulation of cognitive or emotional behaviors tested in this study. The targeted manipulation of CB2R expression in pyramidal neurons and microglia suggests that CB2Rs in different types of cells in the mature hippocampus play distinct roles in the regulation of memory and anxiety.

AB  - Abstract
Around a quarter of neurons in laminae I–II of the dorsal horn are inhibitory interneurons. These play an important role in modulating somatosensory information, including that perceived as pain or itch. Previous studies in rat identified four largely non-overlapping neurochemical populations among these cells, defined by expression of galanin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) or parvalbumin. The galanin cells were subsequently shown to coexpress dynorphin. Several recent studies have used genetically modified mice to investigate the function of different interneuron populations, and it is therefore important to determine whether the same pattern applies in mouse, and to estimate the relative sizes of these populations. We show that the neurochemical organization of inhibitory interneurons in mouse superficial dorsal horn is similar to that in the rat, although a larger proportion of these neurons (33%) express NPY. Between them, these four populations account for ∼75% of inhibitory cells in laminae I–II. Since ∼25% of inhibitory interneurons in this region belong to a novel calretinin-expressing type, our results suggest that virtually all inhibitory interneurons in superficial dorsal horn can be assigned to one of these five neurochemical populations. Although our main focus was inhibitory neurons, we also identified a population of excitatory dynorphin-expressing cells in laminae I–II that are largely restricted to the medial part of the mid-lumbar dorsal horn, corresponding to glabrous skin territory. These findings are important for interpretation of studies using molecular-genetic techniques to manipulate the functions of interneuron populations to investigate their roles in somatosensory processing.

AB  - Abstract
Odors are typically bimodal in nature, interacting with the olfactory and trigeminal systems. The trigeminal component may be noticed (e.g. menthol) or perceptually ignored, leading to different neural substrates being recruited during odor encoding. Therefore, the current study was designed to explore the perceptual and central-nervous activations in response to pleasant bimodal odors using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In this study, healthy subjects were exposed to odorants alone (unimodal) or with a “cooling” trigeminal component (bimodal) at sub- and suprathreshold concentrations with a portable olfactometer in a 3 T fMRI scanner. Within the scanner, subjects reported all odorants as pleasant and intensity increasing with trigeminal concentration. Many of the regions of interest [orbital frontal cortex (OFC), insula, thalamus, cerebellum, postcentral gyrus and cingulate cortex] were activated during bimodal odor conditions when contrasted with unimodal, and interestingly, most of these activations were seen prior to trigeminal perception (e.g. at a sub-threshold level). This includes large bilateral activations within the OFC, insula, cerebellum and parts of the cingulate cortex. Additionally, activation of the thalamus was seen early in the stages of bimodal odor encoding suggesting its role of mediating attention toward the presence of two stimuli. Lastly, intensity encoding during bimodal processing shows overlap of previously demonstrated simple trigeminal encoding areas (medial cingulate cortex) and the more complex olfactory encoding areas (bilateral insula, superior temporal gyrus, OFC, and cerebellum), but not the amygdala.

Use of chemosensory event-related potentials (ERPs) is limited by relatively poor signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We hypothesized that by reducing the standard inter-stimulus interval (ISI), the increased number of trial repetitions possible may increase SNR. In order to further investigate this, we performed the largest study to date assessing chemosensory ERP using short and long ISIs in 101 participants of varying olfactory function. Using rose odor (phenylethylalcohol, PEA) as a relatively selective olfactory stimulant, we found no significant difference in the proportion of individuals in whom ERPs were recorded using short or long ISIs. This was true in normosmic, hyposmic and functionally anosmic individuals. We also demonstrated significantly increased SNR using short PEA-ISIs, in the normosmic and functionally anosmic groups. Comparing between groups of different olfactory function, hyposmic patients achieved faster onsets and greater amplitudes than normosmics under the PEA-10s protocol. This could be due to increased stimulus attendance, but requires confirmation with further research.

AB  - Abstract
Prolonged use/abuse of opioid agonists leads to development of severe dependence to these drugs. Orexin-A has a crucial role in development of morphine dependence. The locus coeruleus (LC) is implicated in the expression of morphine withdrawal signs. Hyperactivity of LC neurons as well as increased intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) level temporally corresponds to the expression of opioid withdrawal behaviors. In this study the effect of central OX1R blockade on neuronal activity and cAMP content of LC neurons was investigated following naloxone administration in morphine-dependent rats. Male Wistar rats weighing 250–300 g were used in this study. To induce morphine dependence, morphine was injected intraperitoneally (10 mg/kg, i.p.) once a day for seven consecutive days. A selective OX1R antagonist (SB-334867) was microinjected into the cerebral ventricle (10 µg/10 µl) immediately before each morphine injection. The activity of LC neurons was investigated using in vivo extracellular single-unit recording on day 8 and naloxone (2 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered after 10-min baseline recording. In addition, immunohistofluorescence method was used to measure the effect of naloxone on coerulear cAMP level. Chronic morphine injection induced morphine dependence in LC neurons which was revealed as a significant increase in LC neuronal firing rate in response to naloxone. The results of this study indicated that SB-334867 administration prior to each morphine injection prevents naloxone-elicited neuronal activation within the LC. In addition, naloxone injection enhanced the cAMP concentration in LC neurons of morphine-dependent animals and this effect was significantly reduced by OX1R blockade.

Ectopic transgene expression in the retina has been reported in various transgenic mice, indicating the importance of characterizing retinal phenotypes. We examined transgene expression in the VGAT-ChR2-EYFP mouse retina by fluorescent immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology, with special emphasis on enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) localization in retinal neuronal subtypes identified by specific markers. Strong EYFP signals were detected in both the inner and outer plexiform layers. In addition, the ChR2-EYFP fusion protein was also expressed in somata of the great majority of inhibitory interneurons, including horizontal cells and GABAergic and glycinergic amacrine cells. However, a small population of amacrine cells residing in the ganglion cell layer were not labeled by EYFP, and a part of them were cholinergic ones. In contrast, no EYFP signal was detected in the somata of retinal excitatory neurons: photoreceptors, bipolar and ganglion cells, as well as Müller glial cells. When glutamatergic transmission was blocked, bright blue light stimulation elicited inward photocurrents from amacrine cells, as well as post-synaptic inhibitory currents from ganglion cells, suggesting a functional ChR2 expression. The VGAT-ChR2-EYFP mouse therefore could be a useful animal model for dissecting retinal microcircuits when targeted labeling and/or optogenetic manipulation of retinal inhibitory neurons are required.

AB  - Abstract
Behavioral effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have been shown to depend on various factors, such as neural activation state, stimulation intensity, and timing of stimulation. Here we examined whether these factors interact, by applying TMS at either sub- or suprathreshold intensity (relative to phosphene threshold, PT) and at different time points during a state-dependent TMS paradigm. The state manipulation involved a behavioral task in which a visual prime (color grating) was followed by a target stimulus which could be either congruent, incongruent or partially congruent with the color and orientation of the prime. In Experiment 1, single-pulse TMS was applied over the early visual cortex (V1/V2) or Vertex (baseline) at the onset of the target stimulus – timing often used in state-dependent TMS studies. With both subthreshold and suprathreshold stimulation, TMS facilitated the detection of incongruent stimuli while not significantly affecting other stimulus types. In Experiment 2, TMS was applied at 100 ms after target onset –a time window in which V1/V2 is responding to visual input. Only TMS applied at suprathreshold intensity facilitated the detection of incongruent stimuli, with no effect with subthreshold stimulation. The need for higher stimulation intensity is likely to reflect reduced susceptibility to TMS of neurons responding to visual stimulation. Furthermore, the finding that in Experiment 2 only suprathreshold TMS induced a behavioral facilitation on incongruent targets (whereas facilitations in the absence of priming have been reported with subthreshold TMS) indicates that priming, by reducing neural excitability to incongruent targets, shifts the facilitatory/inhibitory range of TMS effects.

AB  - Abstract
Neuroprotection is an unmet need in eye disorders characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death, such as prematurity-induced retinal degeneration, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration. In all these disorders excitotoxicity is a prominent component of neuronal damage, but clinical data discourage the development of NMDA receptor antagonists as neuroprotectants. Here, we show that activation of mGlu1 metabotropic glutamate receptors largely contributes to excitotoxic degeneration of RGCs. Mice at postnatal day 9 were challenged with a toxic dose of monosodium glutamate (MSG, 3 g/kg), which caused the death of &gt;70% of Brn-3a+ RGCs. Systemic administration of the mGlu1 receptor negative allosteric modulator (NAM), JNJ16259685 (2.5 mg/kg, s.c.), was largely protective against MSG-induced RGC death. This treatment did not cause changes in motor behavior in the pups. We also injected MSG to crv4 mice, which lack mGlu1 receptors because of a recessive mutation of the gene encoding the mGlu1 receptor. MSG did not cause retinal degeneration in crv4 mice, whereas it retained its toxic activity in their wild-type littermates. These findings demonstrate that mGlu1 receptors play a key role in excitotoxic degeneration of RGCs, and encourage the study of mGlu1 receptor NAMs in models of retinal neurodegeneration.

AB  - Abstract
Widespread pain and anxiety are commonly reported in cancer patients. We hypothesize that cancer is accompanied by attenuation of endogenous opioid-mediated inhibition, which subsequently causes widespread pain and anxiety. To test this hypothesis we used a mouse model of oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the tongue. We found that mice with tongue SCC exhibited widespread nociceptive behaviors in addition to behaviors associated with local nociception that we reported previously. Tongue SCC mice exhibited a pattern of reduced opioid receptor expression in the spinal cord; intrathecal administration of respective mu (MOR), delta (DOR), and kappa (KOR) opioid receptor agonists reduced widespread nociception in mice, except for the fail flick assay following administration of the MOR agonist. We infer from these findings that opioid receptors contribute to widespread nociception in oral cancer mice. Despite significant nociception, mice with tongue SCC did not differ from sham mice in anxiety-like behaviors as measured by the open field assay and elevated maze. No significant differences in c-Fos staining were found in anxiety-associated brain regions in cancer relative to control mice. No correlation was found between nociceptive and anxiety-like behaviors. Moreover, opioid receptor agonists did not yield a statistically significant effect on behaviors measured in the open field and elevated maze in cancer mice. Lastly, we used an acute cancer pain model (injection of cancer supernatant into the mouse tongue) to test whether adaptation to chronic pain is responsible for the absence of greater anxiety-like behavior in cancer mice. No changes in anxiety-like behavior were observed in mice with acute cancer pain.

AB  - Abstract
The innate immune responses of brain to vascular occlusion are primarily orchestrated by activated microglia. However, the roles of microglia in inflammatory responses to brain ischemic injuries are controversial. Here, we report a new mechanism by which microglia confer protective effects on ischemic neuronal cells. We found that under ischemic condition, the B-cell-activating factor (BAFF) was vastly upregulated in microglia and this upregulation could at least be attributed to JAK-STAT signaling pathway activated by IFN-γ and IL-10, which were spatio-temporally enriched in I/R-injured brain as well. Meanwhile, the expression of BAFFR, one member of BAFF receptors, was also upregulated on neurons after I/R injury. More importantly, recombinant BAFF treatment not only promoted neuronal survival under ischemic stresses in vitro but also attenuated infarct volume and neural deficit caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in vivo. Furthermore, blocking BAFF–BAFFR ligation with TACI-Ig abrogated these therapeutic benefits. Taken together, these results indicate that the BAFF–BAFFR ligation bridged between microglia and neurons could play a critical neuroprotective role in I/R injury. Thus, augmenting BAFF–BAFFR signaling might represent a potential target for clinical stroke therapy.

AB  - Abstract
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is accompanied by altered structure and function in cortical, limbic, brainstem, and cerebellar regions. The midbrain is relatively unexamined, but contains many integrative nuclei which mediate physiological functions that are disrupted in OSA. We therefore assessed the chemistry of the midbrain in OSA in this exploratory study. We used a recently developed accelerated 2D magnetic resonance spectroscopy (2D-MRS) technique, compressed sensing-based 4D echo-planar J-resolved spectroscopic imaging (4D-EP-JRESI), to measure metabolites in the midbrain of 14 OSA (mean age ± SD:54.6 ± 10.6 years; AHI:35.0 ± 19.4; SAO2 min:83 ± 7%) and 26 healthy control (50.7 ± 8.5 years) subjects. High-resolution T1-weighted scans allowed voxel localization. MRS data were processed with custom MATLAB-based software, and metabolite ratios calculated with respect to the creatine peak using a prior knowledge fitting (ProFit) algorithm. The midbrain in OSA showed decreased N-acetylaspartate (NAA; OSA:1.24 ± 0.43, Control:1.47 ± 0.41; p = 0.03; independent samples t-test), a marker of neuronal viability. Increased levels in OSA over control subjects appeared in glutamate (Glu; OSA:1.23 ± 0.57, Control:0.98 ± 0.33; p = 0.03), ascorbate (Asc; OSA:0.56 ± 0.28, Control:0.42 ± 0.20; (50.7 ± 8.5 years; p = 0.03), and myo-inositol (mI; OSA:0.96 ± 0.48, Control:0.72 ± 0.35; p = 0.03). No differences between groups appeared in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or taurine. The midbrain in OSA patients shows decreased NAA, indicating neuronal injury or dysfunction. Higher Glu levels may reflect excitotoxic processes and astrocyte activation, and higher mI is also consistent with glial activation. Higher Asc levels may result from oxidative stress induced by intermittent hypoxia in OSA. Additionally, Asc and Glu are involved with glutamatergic processes, which are likely upregulated in the midbrain nuclei of OSA patients. The altered metabolite levels help explain dysfunction and structural deficits in the midbrain of OSA patients.

AB  - Abstract
Niches are specialized microenvironments that regulate stem cells’ activity. The neural stem cell (NSC) niche defines a zone in which NSCs are retained and produce new cells of the nervous system throughout life. Understanding the signaling mechanisms by which the niche controls the NSC fate is crucial for the success of clinical applications. In a recent study, Sato and colleagues, by using state-of-the-art techniques, including sophisticated in vivo lineage-tracing technologies, provide evidence that endothelial amyloid precursor protein (APP) is an important component of the NSC niche. Strikingly, depletion of APP increased NSC proliferation in the subventricular zone, indicating that endothelial cells negatively regulate NSCs’ growth. The emerging knowledge from this research will be important for the treatment of several neurological diseases.

AB  - Abstract
The brain oscillations may play a critical role in synchronizing neuronal assemblies in order to establish appropriate sensory-motor integration. In fact, studies have demonstrated phase-amplitude coupling of distinct oscillatory rhythms during cognitive processes. Here we investigated whether olfacto-hippocampal coupling occurs when mice are detecting familiar odors located in a spatially restricted area of a new context. The spatial olfactory task (SOT) was designed to expose mice to a new environment in which only one quadrant (target) contains odors provided by its own home-cage bedding. As predicted, mice showed a significant higher exploration preference to the target quadrant; which was impaired by olfactory epithelium lesion (ZnSO4). Furthermore, mice were able to discriminate odors from a different cage and avoided the quadrant with predator odor 2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT), reinforcing the specificity of the SOT. The local field potential (LFP) analysis of non-lesioned mice revealed higher gamma activity (35–100 Hz) in the main olfactory bulb (MOB) and a significant theta phase/gamma amplitude coupling between MOB and dorsal hippocampus, only during exploration of home-cage odors (i.e. in the target quadrant). Our results suggest that exploration of familiar odors in a new context involves dynamic coupling between the olfactory bulb and dorsal hippocampus.

AB  - Abstract
Stem cells have been used in novel therapeutic strategies for spinal cord injury (SCI), but the effect of stem cell transplantation on neuropathic pain after SCI is unclear. The current meta-analysis evaluates the effects of stem cell transplantation on neuropathic pain after SCI. We first conducted online searches of PubMed, Web of Science, China Academic Journals Full-text Database, and Wanfang Data for randomized controlled trials that compared stem cell transplantation and vehicle treatments in rodent models of neuropathic pain after SCI. Quality assessment was performed using Cochrane Reviewer’s Handbook 5.1.0, and meta-analysis was conducted with RevMan 5.3. Then, we developed a rat model of SCI and transplanted bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to verify meta-analysis results. Twelve randomized, controlled trials (n = 354 total animals) were included in our meta-analysis and divided by subgroups, including species, timing of behavioral measurements, and transplantation time after SCI. Subgroup analysis of these 12 studies indicated that stem cell-treated animals had a higher mechanical reflex threshold than vehicle groups, with a significant difference in both rats and mice. The thermal withdrawal latency showed the same results in mouse subgroups, but not in rat subgroups. In addition, mesenchymal stem cell transplantation was an effective treatment for mechanical, but not thermal reflex hypersensitivity relief in rats. Transplantation showed a positive effect when carried out at 3 or 7 days post-SCI. Stem cell transplantation alleviates mechanical reflex hypersensitivity in rats and mice and thermal reflex hypersensitivity in mice after SCI.

AB  - Abstract
Blast exposure can cause tinnitus and hearing impairment by damaging the auditory periphery and direct impact to the brain, which trigger neural plasticity in both auditory and non-auditory centers. However, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms of blast-induced tinnitus are still unknown. In this study, we induced tinnitus in rats using blast exposure and investigated changes in spontaneous firing and bursting activity in the auditory cortex (AC) at one day, one month, and three months after blast exposure. Our results showed that spontaneous activity in the tinnitus-positive group began changing at one month after blast exposure, and manifested as robust hyperactivity at all frequency regions at three months after exposure. We also observed an increased bursting rate in the low-frequency region at one month after blast exposure and in all frequency regions at three months after exposure. Taken together, spontaneous firing and bursting activity in the AC played an important role in blast-induced chronic tinnitus as opposed to acute tinnitus, thus favoring a bottom-up mechanism.

AB  - Abstract
Neurons coding spatial location (grid cells) are found in medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and demonstrate increasing size of firing fields and spacing between fields (grid scale) along the dorsoventral axis. This change in grid scale correlates with differences in theta frequency, a 6–10 Hz rhythm in the local field potential (LFP) and rhythmic firing of cells. A relationship between theta frequency and grid scale can be found when examining grid cells recorded in different locations along the dorsoventral axis of MEC.

When describing the relationship between theta frequency and grid scale, it is important to account for the strong positive correlation between theta frequency and running speed. Plotting LFP theta frequency across running speeds dissociates two components of this relationship: slope and intercept of the linear fit. Change in theta frequency through a change in the slope component has been modeled and shown experimentally to affect grid scale, but the prediction that change in the intercept component would not affect grid scale has not been tested experimentally. This prediction about the relationship of intercept to grid scale is the primary hypothesis tested in the experiments presented here.

All known anxiolytic drugs decrease hippocampal theta frequency despite their differing mechanisms of action. Specifically, anxiolytics decrease the intercept of the theta frequency-running speed relationship in the hippocampus. Here we demonstrate that anxiolytics decrease the intercept of the theta frequency-running speed relationship in the MEC, similar to hippocampus, and the decrease in frequency through this change in intercept does not affect grid scale.

AB  - Abstract
The medial preoptic area (mPOA) participates in the temperature and cardiovascular control. The mPOA receives inputs from limbic structures and sends projections to hypothalamus and brainstem. Moreover, stress elicits pronounced neuronal activation in mPOA, suggesting its involvement in central neural pathway mediating stress responses. In the present study, we report the effect of acute mPOA neurotransmission inhibition using cobalt chloride (CoCl2-nonselective synapse blocker) on the mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), body and tail temperature (Tbody and Ttail, respectively), as well as on the HR component of baroreflex. We also verified the participation of mPOA in the autonomic changes evoked by acute restraint stress (RS). Our results demonstrated that microinjection of CoCl2 into mPOA caused tachycardia, hyperthermia and a Ttail decrease, without altering MAP. The inhibition of mPOA with CoCl2 increased the sympathetic component of cardiac baroreflex when assessed 10 min after its administration. In addition, pretreatment of mPOA with CoCl2 increased RS-evoked tachycardic and hyperthermic responses evoked by RS when compared with aCSF-treated animals, without affecting the RS-evoked pressor response and the fall in Ttail. In summary, our results suggest that mPOA exerts a tonic inhibitory influence on the sympathetic cardiac tone under both rest and stress conditions, modulating negatively the sympathetic component of baroreflex. Results also confirm the mPOA involvement in the control of body temperature because its inhibition was followed by a sustained increase in body temperature and vasoconstriction in the tail artery territory.

AB  - Abstract
Development of functional synapses is crucial for the transmission and storage of information in the brain. Post establishment of the initial synaptic contact, synapses are stabilized through neuronal activity-induced signals. Emerging studies have implicated ubiquitination; a reversible posttranslational modification, as a key regulatory switch that modulates synapse development through proteasomal degradation. Ubiquitination of proteins is precisely regulated by E3 ligases, a set of enzymes that bind to specific substrates to facilitate the conjugation of monomeric or polymeric ubiquitin. However, the identity of specific E3 ubiquitin ligases that influence activity-dependent maturation of synapses and the mechanism by which ubiquitination of proteins regulate functional synapse development remain elusive. Here, we have identified a RING domain containing E3 ligase, Rnf2, as an activity-regulated factor that modulates glutamatergic synapse development in the hippocampus. Rnf2 is a synapse associated E3 ligase that is stabilized by neuronal activity through self-polyubiquitination. We have shown that neuronal activity shifts the balance toward stabilization of Rnf2 through self-polyubiquitination rather than triggering its degradation through polyubiquitination by Ube3A, an E3 ligase implicated in Angelman Syndrome. Our synapse density measurements and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings have revealed that the loss of Rnf2 function in cultured hippocampal neurons result in the development of ‘silent’ synapses that lack GluA1 containing functional AMPA receptors. These results provide a plausible mechanistic approach toward understanding how synapse maturation is regulated via the activity-dependent stabilization of Rnf2 through a non-canonical function of polyubiquitination.

AB  - Abstract
The present study characterized quantitatively sexual dimorphic development of gyrification by MRI-based morphometry. High spatial-resolution 3D MR images (using RARE sequence with short TR and minimum TE setting) were acquired from fixed brain of male and female ferrets at postnatal days (PDs) 4–90 using 7-tesla preclinical MRI system. The gyrification index was evaluated either throughout the cerebral cortex (global GI) or in representative primary sulci (sulcal GI). The global GI increased linearly from PD 4, and reached a peak at PD 42, marking 1.486 ± 0.018 in males and 1.460 ± 0.010 in females, respectively. Sexual difference was obtained by greater global GI in males than in females on PD 21 and thereafter. Rostrocaudal GI distribution revealed an overall male-over-female sulcal infolding throughout the cortex on PD 21. Then, an adult pattern of sexually dimorphic cortical convolution was achieved so that gyrification in the temporo-parieto-occipital region was more progressive in males than in females on PD 42, and slightly extended posteriorly in males until PD 90. In the sulcal GI, sulcus-specific male-over-female GI was revealed in the rhinal fissure, and presylvian sulcus on PD 42, and additionally in the coronal, splenial, lateral, and caudal suprasylvian sulci on PD 90. The current results suggest that age-related sexual dimorphism of the gyrification was biphasic in the ferret cortex. A male-over-female gyrification was allometric by PD 21, and was thereafter specific to primary sulci located on phylogenetically newer multimodal cortical regions.

AB  - Abstract
Morphometry studies of human brain development have revealed characteristics of some growth patterns, such as gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM), but the features that make human neurodevelopment distinct from that in other species remain unclear. Studies of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a small New World primate, can provide insights into unique features such as cooperative behaviors complementary to those from comparative analyses using mouse and rhesus monkey. In the present study, we analyzed developmental patterns of GM, WM, and cortical regions with volume measurements using longitudinal sample (23 marmosets; 11 male, 12 female) between the ages of one and 30 months. Regional analysis using a total of 164 magnetic resonance imaging datasets revealed that GM volume increased before puberty (5.4 months), but subsequently declined until adulthood, whereas WM volume increased rapidly before stabilizing around puberty (9.9 months). Cortical regions showed similar patterns of increase and decrease, patterns with global GM but differed in the timing of volume peak and degree of decline across regions. The progressive–regressive pattern detected in both global and cortical GM was well correlated to phases of synaptogenesis and synaptic pruning reported in previous marmoset studies. A rapid increase in WM in early development may represent a distinctive aspect of human neurodevelopment. These findings suggest that studies of marmoset brain development can provide valuable comparative information that will facilitate a deeper understanding of human brain growth and neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Both insulin signaling disruption and Ca2+ dysregulation are closely related to memory loss during aging and increase the vulnerability to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In hippocampal neurons, aging-related changes in calcium regulatory pathways have been shown to lead to higher intracellular calcium levels and an increase in the Ca2+-dependent afterhyperpolarization (AHP), which is associated with cognitive decline. Recent studies suggest that insulin reduces the Ca2+-dependent AHP. Given the sensitivity of neurons to insulin and evidence that brain insulin signaling is reduced with age, insulin-mediated alterations in calcium homeostasis may underlie the beneficial actions of insulin in the brain. Indeed, increasing insulin signaling in the brain via intranasal delivery has yielded promising results such as improving memory in both clinical and animal studies. However, while several mechanisms have been proposed, few have focused on regulation on intracellular Ca2+. In the present study, we further examined the effects of acute insulin on calcium pathways in primary hippocampal neurons in culture. Using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique, we found that acute insulin delivery reduced voltage-gated calcium currents. Fura-2 imaging was used to also address acute insulin effects on spontaneous and depolarization-mediated Ca2+ transients. Results indicate that insulin reduced Ca2+ transients, which appears to have involved a reduction in ryanodine receptor function. Together, these results suggest insulin regulates pathways that control intracellular Ca2+ which may reduce the AHP and improve memory. This may be one mechanism contributing to improved memory recall in response to intranasal insulin therapy in the clinic.

AB  - Abstract
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) induces rapid improvement of depressive symptoms in patients suffering from treatment-refractory major depressive disorder (MDD). It has been hypothesized that activation of the dopamine (DA) system contributes to this effect. To investigate whether DBS in the MFB affects DA release in the striatum, we combined DBS with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) in freely moving rats. Animals were implanted with a stimulating electrode at the border of the MFB and the ventral tegmental area, and a FSCV microelectrode in the ventromedial striatum to monitor extracellular DA during the acute onset of DBS and subsequent continued stimulation. DBS onset induced a significant increase in extracellular DA concentration in the ventromedial striatum that was sustained for at least 40 s. However, continued DBS did not affect amplitude or frequency of so-called spontaneous phasic DA transients, nor phasic DA release in response to the delivery of unexpected food pellets. These findings suggest that effects of DBS in the MFB are mediated by an acute change in extracellular DA concentration, but more research is needed to further explore the potentially sustained duration of this effect. Together, our results provide both support and refinement of the hypothesis that MFB DBS activates the DA system: DBS induces an increase in overall ambient concentration of DA, but spontaneous or reward-associated more rapid, phasic DA dynamics are not enhanced. This knowledge improves our understanding of how DBS affects brain function and may help improve future therapies for depressive symptoms.

AB  - Abstract
The transition from multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs) to terminally differentiated neurons is a multistep process, and the transition is finely regulated by transcription factors with basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) motifs. Melatonin is an endogenous neurohormone with profound neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects both during the embryonic developmental stage and adulthood. The effects of melatonin on the differentiation of NSCs have been reported, and these effects may be responsible for its neuroprotective properties. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of melatonin are not well understood. It is unclear whether melatonin affects the expression of bHLH factors at the onset of neuronal differentiation, and the molecular mechanisms involved still need to be further explored. Using mouse NSCs, we identified a novel role for melatonin in the epigenetic regulation of bHLH factors during neuronal differentiation. Our data showed that melatonin promoted neuronal differentiation by specifically increasing the acetylation of histone H3 lysine14 (H3K14). Increased H3K14 acetylation altered the chromatin state of the promoters of bHLH factors Neurogenin1 and NeuroD1 and activated their transcription; then, Neurogenin1 and NeuroD1 initiated and sustained the commitment to neuronal fates. As we know, CBP/p300 is an important class of histone acetyltransferases that acetylate histone H3K14, we found that melatonin activated the histone acetyltransferase activity of CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 via ERK signaling pathways. For the first time, we systematically showed the molecular mechanism of action of melatonin, which suggested that melatonin functions as a regulator of the acetylation-dependent gene expression network.

AB  - Abstract
Neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) plays a vital role in neurologic recovery after stroke. However, only a small fraction of newly generated neuroblasts from the SVZ will survive long-term. Successful migration and survival of neuroblasts requires angiogenesis, lesion-derived chemo-attractants, and appropriate local microenvironments, which are partly regulated by the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) signaling pathway. In this study, we investigated the effects of PDGFR inhibition in a mouse model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). We blocked the pathway using a nonselective PDGFR inhibitor, crenolanib, during the acute post-MCAO phase (days 1–3) or during the sub-acute phase (days 7–9). Downregulating the PDGFR signaling pathway with crenolanib from day 1 to day 3 after MCAO significantly decreased the migration of neuroblasts from the SVZ to the peri-infarct region, decreased angiogenesis, and lowered expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, stromal cell-derived factor-1, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1. Downregulation of the PDGFR signaling pathway on days 7–9 with crenolanib significantly increased apoptosis of the neuroblasts that had migrated to the peri-infarct region, increased the number of activated microglia, and decreased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3, and interleukin-10. Crenolanib treatment increased the apoptosis of pericytes and decreased the pericyte/vascular coverage, but had no effects on apoptosis of astrocytes. We conclude that the PDGFR signaling pathway plays a vital role in the SVZ neurogenesis after stroke. It can also affect angiogenesis, lesion-derived chemo-attractants, and the local microenvironment, which are all important to stroke-induced neurogenesis.

AB  - Abstract
PTPN11 is associated with regulation of growth factor signaling pathways in neuronal cells. Using SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, we showed that adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated PTPN11 upregulation was associated with TrkB antagonism, reduced neuritogenesis and enhanced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response leading to apoptotic changes. Genetic knock-down of PTPN11 on the other hand leads to increased TrkB phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells. ER stress response induced by PTPN11 upregulation was alleviated pharmacologically by a TrkB agonist. Conversely the enhanced ER stress response induced by TrkB receptor antagonism was ameliorated by PTPN11 suppression, providing evidence of cross-talk of PTPN11 effects with TrkB actions. BDNF treatment of neuronal cells with PTPN11 upregulation also resulted in reduced expression of ER stress protein markers. This study provides evidence of molecular interactions between PTPN11 and the TrkB receptor in SH-SY5Y cells. The results reinforce the role played by PTPN11 in regulating neurotrophin protective signaling in neuronal cells and highlight that PTPN11 dysregulation promotes apoptotic activation. Based on these findings we suggest that blocking PTPN11 could have potential beneficial effects to limit the progression of neuronal loss in neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Abstract
In this study, we examined the relationship between tractography-based measures of white matter integrity (ex. fractional anisotropy [FA]) from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and five reading-related tasks, including rapid automatized naming (RAN) of letters, digits, and objects, and reading of real words and nonwords. Twenty university students with no reported history of reading difficulties were tested on all five tasks and their performance was correlated with diffusion measures extracted through DTI tractography. A secondary analysis using whole-brain Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) was also used to find clusters showing significant negative correlations between reaction time and FA. Results showed a significant relationship between the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus FA and performance on the RAN of objects task, as well as a strong relationship to nonword reading, which suggests a role for this tract in slower, non-automatic and/or resource-demanding speech tasks. There were no significant relationships between FA and the faster, more automatic speech tasks (RAN of letters and digits, and real word reading). These findings provide evidence for the role of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus in tasks that are highly demanding of orthography–phonology translation (e.g., nonword reading) and semantic processing (e.g., RAN object). This demonstrates the importance of the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus in basic naming and suggests that this tract may be a sensitive predictor of rapid naming performance within the typical population. We discuss the findings in the context of current models of reading and speech production to further characterize the white matter pathways associated with basic reading processes.

AB  - Abstract
Secondary neuronal degeneration (SND) occurring in Traumatic brain injury (TBI) consists in downstream destructive events affecting cells that were not or only marginally affected by the initial wound, further increasing the effects of the primary injury. Glutamate excitotoxicity is hypothesized to play an important role in SND. TBI is a common cause of olfactory dysfunction that may be spontaneous and partially recovered. The role of the glutamate excitotoxicity in the TBI-induced olfactory dysfunction is still unknown.

We investigated the effects of excitotoxicity induced by bilateral N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) OB administration in the olfactory function, OB volumes, and subventricular zone (SVZ) and OB neurogenesis in rats. NMDA OB administration induced a decrease in the number of correct choices in the olfactory discrimination tests one week after lesions (p &lt; 0.01), and a spontaneous recovery of the olfactory deficit two weeks after lesions (p &lt; 0.05). A lack of correlation between OB volumes and olfactory function was observed. An increase in SVZ neurogenesis (Ki67+ cells, PSANCAM+ cells (p &lt; 0.01) associated with an increase in OB glomerular dopaminergic immunostaining (p &lt; 0.05) were related to olfactory function recovery.

The present results show that changes in OB volumes cannot explain the recovery of the olfactory function and suggest a relevant role for dopaminergic OB interneurons in the pathophysiology of recovery of loss of smell in TBI.

AB  - Abstract
In the rat, the rubrospinal tract (RST) is a descending motor pathway involved in the production of skilled reaching movement. The RST originates in the red nucleus in the midbrain and runs down the spinal cord in the lateral most aspect of the dorsolateral funiculus (DLF). The RST makes monosynaptic contact with interneurons within the intermediate laminae of the cord, however a contingent of RST axons constitutes direct supraspinal input for spinal cord motor neurons. The current study investigated the effects of unilateral RST transection at cervical levels C3-4 on the population of motor neurons in both spinal segments C5-6 and L2-3. The total number of large, medium and small motor neurons in these segments was estimated with stereological techniques in both ventral horns at 1, 3, 7 and 14 days post-injury. In both spinal cord segments under investigation, no change was detected in mean number of motor neurons over time, in either ventral horn. That the loss of direct supraspinal input resulting from the RST transection does not affect the viability of motor neurons caudal to the injury indicates that these neurons have the potential to be re-innervated, should the RST injury be repaired.

Stress during early development produces lasting effects on psychopathological outcomes. We analysed the impact of prior intermittent, physical stress (IPS) during early adolescence (PD 22–33) on anxiety-like behaviour of female rats in adulthood. After behavioural testing, we used immunohistochemistry for the 5-HT transporter (SERT) to evaluate 5-HT innervation profiles in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and ventral hippocampus (VH). Administration of IPS (i.e., water immersion, elevated platform, foot shock) in early adolescence increased rats’ anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated plus-maze but had no effects in the shock-probe burying test. In the social interaction test, IPS decreased social interaction, and this effect was driven by selective decreases in the frequency of playfighting with no evident changes in contact and investigative behaviours. Selective stress-induced increases in the density of SERT-ir positive fibres were found in the infralimbic (IL) subregion of the mPFC but not in the cingulate or prelimbic (PL) subregions. IPS in early adolescence did not affect 5-HT innervation profiles in any sub-fields of the VH. Our findings confirm and extend on earlier evidence that stress during early adolescence promotes the emergence of an anxious phenotype and provide novel evidence that these effects are associated with increased 5-HT innervation of the IL mPFC.

AB  - Abstract
Functional and morphological changes in C-fiber bladder afferent pathways are reportedly involved in neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) after spinal cord injury (SCI). This study examined the morphological changes in different populations of bladder afferent neurons after SCI using replication-defective herpes simplex virus (HSV) vectors encoding the mCherry reporter driven by neuronal cell-type-specific promoters. Spinal intact (SI) and SCI mice were injected into the bladder wall with HSV mCherry vectors driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, CGRP promoter, TRPV1 promoter or neurofilament 200 (NF200) promoter. Two weeks after vector inoculation into the bladder wall, L1 and L6 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were removed bilaterally for immunofluorescent staining using anti-mCherry antibody. The number of CMV promoter vector-labeled neurons was not altered after SCI. The number of CGRP and TRPV1 promoter vector-labeled neurons was significantly increased whereas the number of NF200 vector-labeled neurons was decreased in L6 DRG after SCI. The median size of CGRP promoter-labeled C-fiber neurons was increased from 247.0 in SI mice to 271.3 μm2 in SCI mice whereas the median cell size of TRPV1 promoter vector-labeled neurons was decreased from 245.2 in SI mice to 216.5 μm2 in SCI mice. CGRP and TRPV1 mRNA levels of laser-captured bladder afferent neurons labeled with Fast Blue were significantly increased in SCI mice compared to SI mice. Thus, using a novel HSV vector-mediated neuronal labeling technique, we found that SCI induces expansion of the CGRP- and TRPV1-expressing C-fiber cell population, which could contribute to C-fiber afferent hyperexcitability and NDO after SCI.

AB  - Abstract
Spontaneous neural repair from endogenous neural stem cells’ (NSCs) niches occurs in response to central nervous system (CNS) injuries to only a limited extent. Uncovering the mechanisms that control neural repair and can be further manipulated to promote NSCs toward oligodendrocyte progenitors cells (OPCs) and myelinating oligodendrocytes is a major objective. In the current study, we describe high-throughput transcriptional changes in adult mouse subventricular zone (SVZ)-NSCs during differentiation in vitro. In order to identify myelin-specific transcriptional regulators among large transcriptional changes associated with differentiation, we have focused on transcripts encoding transcription factors and regulators showing expression profile that is highly correlated with expression of myelin-encoding genes. We have revealed previously undescribed effect of Prickle1 and Nfe2l3 transcriptional regulators that are positively correlated with expression of myelin basic protein (MBP). Using Prickle1 and Nfe2l3 silencing and immunocytochemistry approaches, we demonstrated that silencing of Prickle1 dramatically decreases differentiation to NG2+OPCs while Nfe2l3 moderately decreases as compared with control siRNA. Moreover, silencing of Prickle1 also decreases maturation of OPCs to MBP+ oligodendrocytes (OLs). Accordingly, overexpression of Prickle1 increases the differentiation of NSCs to CNPase+ pre-myelinating and myelinating MBP+ OLs. In particular, the necessity of Prickle1 for oligodendrocyte differentiation is demonstrated in purified OPCs cultures. Our findings demonstrate the role of Prickle1 in positive regulation of differentiation and maturation of oligodendrocytes suggesting that targeting Prickle1 in CNS injuries and particularly in demyelinating disease could promote generation of myelinating oligodendrocytes from endogenous niches to replenish damaged oligodendrocytes.

AB  - Abstract
There have been extensive studies of intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) in the human brains using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the literature. However, the functional organization of ICNs in macaque brains has been less explored so far, despite growing interests in the field. In this work, we propose a computational framework to identify connectome-scale group-wise consistent ICNs in macaques via sparse representation of whole-brain resting-state fMRI data. Experimental results demonstrate that 70 group-wise consistent ICNs are successfully identified in macaque brains via the proposed framework. These 70 ICNs are interpreted based on two publicly available parcellation maps of macaque brains and our work significantly expand currently known macaque ICNs already reported in the literature. In general, this set of connectome-scale group-wise consistent ICNs can potentially benefit a variety of studies in the neuroscience and brain-mapping fields, and they provide a foundation to better understand brain evolution in the future.

AB  - Abstract
Local lesions caused by stroke may result in extensive structural and functional reorganization in the brain. Previous studies of this phenomenon have focused on specific brain networks. Here, we aimed to discover abnormalities in whole-brain networks and to explore the decoupling between structural and functional connectivity in patients with stroke. Fifteen ischemic stroke patients and 23 normal controls (NCs) were recruited in this study. A graph theoretical analysis was employed to investigate the abnormal topological properties of structural and functional brain networks in patients with stroke. Both patients with stroke and NCs exhibited small-world organization in brain networks. However, compared to NCs, patients with stroke exhibited abnormal global properties characterized by a higher characteristic path length and lower global efficiency. Furthermore, patients with stroke showed altered nodal characteristics, primarily in certain motor- and cognition-related regions. Positive correlations between the nodal degree of the inferior parietal lobule and the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) score and between the nodal betweenness centrality of the posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG) and immediate recall were observed in patients with stroke. Most importantly, the strength of the structural–functional connectivity network coupling was decreased, and the coupling degree was related to the FMA score of patients, suggesting that decoupling may provide a novel biomarker for the assessment of motor impairment in patients with stroke. Thus, the topological organization of brain networks is altered in patients with stroke, and our results provide insights into the structural and functional organization of the brain after stroke from the viewpoint of network topology.

AB  - Abstract
Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD), and especially those with freezing of gait (FOG), are known to experience impairments in gait rhythmicity, symmetry, and bilateral coordination between both legs. In the current study, we investigated whether deficits in perception of gait speed between limbs were more pronounced in freezers than in non-freezers and could explain some of these gait impairments. We also assessed cognitive ability and proprioception. Twenty-five PD patients (13 freezers, 12 non-freezers) and 12 healthy controls walked on a split-belt treadmill, while the speed of one of the belts was gradually increased. Participants had to indicate the moment at which they perceived belt speeds to be different. The main outcome variables were the number of correct responses (perception accuracy) and the difference in belt speeds at the moment the participants perceived belt speeds to be different (perception threshold). In addition, gait characteristics during both split- and tied-belt walking were determined. Results showed significantly lower perception accuracy in freezers, whereas the perception threshold did not differ between groups. During tied-belt walking, freezers exhibited more asymmetrical step lengths and limb excursions than non-freezers and healthy controls. Greater step length and limb excursions were associated with better perception, whereas more variable gait was associated with more impaired perception. The results confirm the hypothesis that freezers have impaired perception of locomotor asymmetry. While proprioceptive and cognitive ability did not explain these findings, the possible causal link with the occurrence of FOG needs further corroboration.

AB  - Abstract
Bumetanide is a selective inhibitor of the Na+-K+-Cl−-co-transporter 1(NKCC1). We studied whether bumetanide could affect axonal growth and behavioral outcome in stroke rats. Adult male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to four groups: sham-operated rats treated with vehicle or bumetanide, and ischemic rats treated with vehicle or bumetanide. Endothelin-1 was used to induce focal cerebral ischemia. Bumetanide administration (i.c.v.) started on postoperative day 7 and continued for 3 weeks. Biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) was injected into the right imotor cortex on postoperative day 14 to trace corticospinal tract (CST) fibers sprouting into the denervated cervical spinal cord. Nogo-A, NKCC1, KCC2 and BDNF in the perilesional cortex and BDA, PSD-95 and vGlut1 in the denervated spinal cord were measured by immunohistochemistry and/or Western blot. Behavioral outcome of rats was assessed by the beam walking and cylinder tests. The total length of CST fibers sprouting into the denervated cervical spinal cord significantly increased after stroke and bumetanide further increased this sprouting. Bumetanide treatment also decreased the expressions of NKCC1 and Nogo-A, increased the expressions of KCC2 and BDNF in the perilesional cortex and enhanced the synaptic plasticity in the denervated cervical spinal cord after cerebral ischemia. The behavioral performance of ischemic rats was significantly improved by bumetanide. In conclusion, bumetanide promoted post-stroke axonal sprouting together accompanied by an improved behavioral outcome possibly through restoring and maintaining neuronal chloride homeostasis and creating a recovery-promoting microenvironment by overcoming the axonal growth inhibition encountered after cerebral ischemia in rats.

AB  - Abstract
Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is induced by elevated intracranial dopamine (DA). Glutamate (Glu) toxicity is known to be involved in many neurological disorders. In this study, we investigated whether DA increased Glu levels and collaborated with Glu to impair memory. We found that DA upregulated TAAR1, leading to reduced EAAT2 expression and Glu clearance in primary cortical astrocytes (PCAs). High DA increased TAAR1 expression, and high Glu increased AMPAR expression, inducing the activation of CaN/NFAT signaling and a decrease in the production of BDNF (Brain Derived Nerve Growth Factor)/NT3 (neurotrophin-3) in primary cortical neurons (PCNs). DA activated TAAR1 to downregulate EAAT2 and increase extracellular Glu levels in MHE. Additionally, DA together with Glu caused decreased production of neuronal BDNF/NT3 and memory impairment through the activation of CaN/NFAT signaling in MHE. From these findings, we conclude that DA increases Glu levels via interaction with TAAR1 and disruption of EAAT2 signaling in astrocytes, and DA interacting with TAAR1 and Glu interacting with AMPAR synergistically decreased the production of BDNF by activation of CaN/NFAT signaling to impair memory in MHE rats.

AB  - Abstract
Parkinson’s disease is a debilitating neurodegenerative movement disorder, characterized by the progressive and selective loss of dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra, leading to clinical motor symptoms. The factors involved in PD are rather multifaceted. There are many cellular pathways contributing to its neuro-pathogenesis, which include abnormal protein aggregation, impaired ubiquitin proteasome system, autophagy, and neuroinflammation. However, despite years of investigation, still little is known about early events in the molecular pathogenesis. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that can regulate post-transcriptional expression of mRNAs. Since they somewhat modulate many mRNA targets simultaneously, many cellular pathways may be affected by one individual miRNA. Moreover, miRNAs can stably circulate in cerebrospinal fluid and blood, and their expression pattern can reflect the molecular pathophysiology, thus making them promising biomarkers in PD diagnosis and prognosis. In this review, we will review the recent progress on miRNA’s mechanism in PD pathogenesis and discuss the possibilities of miRNAs as PD molecular biomarkers.

AB  - Abstract
The capacity to identify unanticipated abnormal cues in a natural scene is vital for animal survival. Stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) has been considered the neuronal correlate for deviance detection. There have been comprehensive assessments of SSA in the frequency domain along the ascending auditory pathway, but only little attention given to deviance detection in the spatial domain. We found that thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) neurons exhibited stronger responses to a tone when it was presented rarely as opposed to frequently at a certain spatial location. Subsequently, we engaged signal detection theory to directly gauge neuronal spatial discriminability and found that discrimination of deviant locations was considerably higher than standard locations. The variability in neuronal spatial discriminability among the TRN population was directly related to response difference (RD) but not variance; meanwhile, further analyses attributed higher spatial sensitivity at deviant locations to larger RD. Astonishingly, a significant correlation was found between the amount of adaptation and deviant discriminability. Collectively, our results suggest that adaptation facilitates rare location discrimination by sharpening the response gap between two locations.

AB  - Abstract
Bradykinin (BK), a component of the kallikrein-kininogen-kinin system exerts multiple effects via B1 and B2 receptor activation. In the cardiovascular system, bradykinin has cardioprotective and vasodilator properties. We investigated the effect of BK on cardiac-projecting neurons of nucleus ambiguus, a key site for the parasympathetic cardiac regulation. BK produced a dose-dependent increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Pretreatment with HOE140, a B2 receptor antagonist, but not with R715, a B1 receptor antagonist, abolished the response to BK. A selective B2 receptor agonist, but not a B1 receptor agonist, elicited an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ similarly to BK. Inhibition of N-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels with ω-conotoxin GVIA had no effect on the Ca2+ signal produced by BK, while pretreatment with ω-conotoxin MVIIC, a blocker of P/Q-type of Ca2+ channels, significantly diminished the effect of BK. Pretreatment with xestospongin C and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, antagonists of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors, abolished the response to BK. Inhibition of ryanodine receptors reduced the BK-induced Ca2+ increase, while disruption of lysosomal Ca2+ stores with bafilomycin A1 did not affect the response. BK produced a dose-dependent depolarization of nucleus ambiguus neurons, which was prevented by the B2 receptor antagonist. In vivo studies indicate that microinjection of BK into nucleus ambiguus elicited bradycardia in conscious rats via B2 receptors. In summary, in cardiac vagal neurons of nucleus ambiguus, BK activates B2 receptors promoting Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum, and membrane depolarization; these effects are translated in vivo by bradycardia.

AB  - Abstract
Theta burst stimulation (TBS) has emerged as a promising tool for the treatment of swallowing disorders; however, the short-term after-effects of brain activation induced by TBS remain unknown. Here, we measured the changes in spontaneous brain activation using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) approach in subjects who underwent different TBS protocols. Sixty right-handed healthy participants (male, n = 30; female, n = 30; mean age = 23.5 y) were recruited in this study and randomly assigned to three groups that underwent three different TBS protocols. In group 1, continuous TBS (cTBS) was positioned on the left hemisphere of the suprahyoid muscle cortex. For group 2, intermittent TBS (iTBS) was placed on the left hemisphere of the suprahyoid muscle cortex. Group 3 underwent combined cTBS/iTBS protocols in which iTBS on the right hemisphere was performed immediately after completing cTBS on the left suprahyoid muscle cortex. Compared to pre-TBS, post-cTBS showed decreased ALFF in the anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 32); post-iTBS induced an increase in ALFF in the bilateral precuneus (BA 7); and post-cTBS/iTBS induced a decrease in ALFF in the brainstem, and resulted in increased ALFF in the middle cingulate gyrus (BA 24) as well as the left precentral gyrus (BA 6). Compared the effect of post-TBS protocols, increased ALFF was found in left posterior cerebellum lobe and left inferior parietal lobule (BA 40) (post-cTBS vs post-iTBS), and decreased ALFF exhibited in paracentral lobule (BA 4) (post-iTBS vs post-cTBS/iTBS). These findings indicate that multiple brain areas involved in swallowing regulation after stimulation of TBS over the suprahyoid muscles. cTBS induces decreased after-effects while iTBS results in increased after-effects on spontaneous brain activation. Moreover, iTBS can eliminate the after-effects of cTBS applied on the contralateral swallowing cortex and alter the activity of contralateral motor cortex and brainstem. Our findings provide a novel evidence for the short-term effect of TBS on spontaneous brain activation.

AB  - Abstract
Excessive Glutamate (Glu) release may trigger excitotoxic cellular death by the activation of intracellular signaling pathways that transduce extracellular signals to the cell nucleus, which determines the onset of a death program. One such signaling pathway is the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), which is involved in both survival and cell death. Experimental evidences from the use of specific inhibitors supports the participation of some MAPK pathway components in the excitotoxicity mechanism, but the complete process of this activation, which terminates in cell damage and death, is not clearly understood. The present work, we investigated the changes in the expression level of some MAPK-pathway components in hippocampal excitotoxic cell death in the neonatal rats using an experimental model of subcutaneous monosodium glutamate (MSG) administration on postnatal days (PD) 1, 3, 5 and 7. Data were collected at different ages through PD 14. Cell viability was evaluated using fluorescein diacetate mixed with propidium iodide (FDA-PI), and the Nissl-staining technique was used to evaluate histological damage. Transcriptional changes were also investigated in 98 components of the MAPK pathway that are associated with cell damage. These results are an evidence of that repetitive use of MSG, in neonatal rats, induces cell damage-associated transcriptional changes of MAPK components, that might reflect a differential stage of both biochemical and molecular brain maturation. This work also suggests that some of the proteins evaluated such as phosphorylated retinoblastoma (pRb) protein, which was up-regulated, could regulate the response to excitotoxic through modulation of the process of re-entry into the cell cycle in the hippocampus of rats treated with MSG.

AB  - Abstract
Previous studies have shown that leptin resistance is a key feature that leads to gestational metabolic adaptions. We hypothesized that leptin sensitivity in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) plays a critical role regulating gestational metabolic changes. In the present study, we generated a mouse model carrying ablation of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) in steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1) cells, which include the VMH, in order to investigate whether increased leptin sensitivity in this neuronal population prevents at least part of the metabolic changes typically observed during gestation and lactation. As predicted by the inhibitory effects of SOCS3 in leptin signaling, pregnant SF1 SOCS3 KO mice exhibited increased leptin sensitivity in the VMH, since an acute leptin injection induced a 95% increase in the STAT3 phosphorylation in this nucleus, compared to control animals (p = 0.02). Despite that, SF1 SOCS3 KO mice showed similar weight gain, food intake, hypothalamic neuropeptide expression and serum leptin levels during pregnancy compared to control littermates. Unexpectedly, SF1 SOCS3 KO mice exhibited glucose intolerance during pregnancy. SF1 SOCS3 KO mice also presented a lower body weight (−3%; p &lt; 0.05) during mid and late lactation, although food intake, litter size and offspring growth were not affected. Our findings suggest that increased leptin sensitivity in the VMH causes modest metabolic effects and is not sufficient to prevent major metabolic adaptations of pregnancy and lactation.

AB  - Abstract
Little is known about how the central nervous system prepares postural responses differently in anticipated compared to non-anticipated perturbations. To investigate this, participants were exposed to translational and rotational perturbations presented in a blocked (anticipated) and a random (non-anticipated) design. The preparatory setting (‘central set’) was measured by H-reflexes, motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) shortly before perturbation onset in the soleus of 15 healthy adults. Additionally, the behavioral consequences of differential preparatory settings were analyzed by comparing the short- (SLR), medium- (MLR), and long-latency response (LLR) of the soleus after anticipated and non-anticipated rotations and translations. H-reflexes elicited before perturbation were different between conditions (p = 0.023) with larger amplitudes in anticipated translations compared to anticipated rotations (37.0%; p = 0.048). Reduced SICI was found in the three conditions containing perturbations compared to static standing (p &lt; 0.001). Muscular responses assessed after perturbations remained unchanged for the SLR and MLR, whereas the LLR was decreased in anticipated rotations (−36.2%; p = 0.002) and increased in anticipated translations (16.7%; p = 0.046) compared to the corresponding non-anticipated perturbation. As the SLR and MLR are organized at the spinal and the LLR at the cortical level, the preparatory setting seems to mainly influence cortically mediated postural responses. However, the modulation of the H-reflex before anticipated perturbations indicates that supraspinal centers adjusted Ia-afferent transmission for the soleus in a perturbation-specific manner. Intracortical inhibition was also modulated but differentiates to a lesser extent only between perturbation conditions and unperturbed stance.

AB  - Abstract
The polypeptide ghrelin is an endogenous ligand at the growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a. To ghrelin multiple functions have been ascribed including promotion of gastrointestinal motility. Postprandial ghrelin levels have been reported to be reduced in patients suffering from Parkinson disease (PD). Experimental studies revealed neuroprotective effects of ghrelin in different PD models. The purpose of the present study was (i) to further elucidate the mechanism underlying the neuroprotective action of ghrelin and (ii) to determine whether these effects occur with both the acylated and the unacylated form. The study was conducted in primary mesencephalic cultures treated with mitochondrial complex I and complex II inhibitors. We show that protective effects of ghrelin against complex I inhibition with MPP+ were independent of the acylation status of ghrelin, although acylated ghrelin appeared to be more potent. Protection by both forms was also observed when neurons were exposed to the complex II inhibitor 3-NP. Both forms led to higher oxygen consumption rates upon electron transport chain uncoupling, indicating that the two peptides may exert uncoupling effects themselves. We demonstrate that the rescue provided by ghrelin required calcium influx through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. Whereas the protective effects of acylated ghrelin required receptor binding, effects of the unacylated form remained unaffected by treatment with a ghrelin receptor antagonist. Importantly, inhibition of ghrelin O-acyltransferase failed to reduce the activity of unacylated ghrelin. Overall, our data suggest that both acylated and unacylated ghrelin afford protection to dopamine neurons but through mechanisms that only partially overlap.

AB  - Abstract
One of the earliest activities expressed within the developing central nervous system is a widely propagating wave-like activity, which we referred to as the depolarization wave. Despite considerable consensus concerning the global features of the activity, its physiological role is yet to be clarified. The depolarization wave is expressed during a specific period of functional synaptogenesis, and this developmental profile has led to the hypothesis that the wave plays some roles in synaptic network organization. In the present study, we tested this hypothesis by inhibiting the depolarization wave in ovo and examining its effects on the development of functional synapses in vagus nerve-related brainstem nuclei of the chick embryo. Chronic inhibition of the depolarization wave had no significant effect on the developmental time course, amplitude, and spatial distribution of monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials in the first-order nuclei of the vagal sensory pathway (the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS) and the contralateral non-NTS region), but reduced polysynaptic responses in the higher-order nucleus (the parabrachial nucleus). These results suggest that the depolarization wave plays an important role in the initial process of functional synaptic expression in the brainstem, especially in the higher-order nucleus of the cranial sensory pathway.

AB  - Abstract
To explore brain activity and the related neurochemical processes, current research focuses increasingly on the combined acquisition of 1H MR spectra and fMRI data to investigate potential associations between local metabolite resting state levels and stimulus-induced BOLD signal changes. In this study, whole-brain fMRI measurements and localized functional 1H MEGA-PRESS MRS scans were conducted at 3T in healthy subjects prior to and during acute pain stimulation to quantify resting state GABA+/tCr and Glx/tCr levels in the insular cortex together with their stimulus-induced changes and to explore associations between these neurochemical parameters with intra-regional but also inter-regional BOLD responses. Inter-regionally, a significant negative correlation between the BOLD signal of a cluster in the supplementary motor area with overlap to the mid-cingulate cortex (R = −0.56, p = 0.004) and the insular resting state GABA+/tCr was obtained. Furthermore, pain induced insular ΔGlx was significantly positively associated with the BOLD signal in the left superior frontal gyrus, left and right inferior frontal gyrus, left inferior parietal lobe, left superior temporal gyrus, left anterior insula and right posterior insula, with R values ranging from 0.59 to 0.73 (p &lt; 0.005). No intra-regional association was observed between BOLD and metabolite measures. These findings point toward interactions between metabolite levels and stimulus-induced BOLD responses in brain regions belonging to the pain processing network. The combination of fMRS and fMRI provides a powerful tool to improve our understanding about the complex system of neurochemical processes and brain activity within brain networks.

AB  - Abstract
Several diseases are characterized by cognitive instability, which is amplified in the conditions of sleep deprivation (SD). Cognitive instability in SD can be examined by the number of lapses on the psychomotor vigilance test (PVT), which is considered to be a gold standard in the field. However, the number of PVT lapses widely range according to inter-individual differences, from apparent cognitive resistance to severe cognitive impairment. In this study, tract-based spatial statistical analyses with multiple diffusion tensor imaging-derived characteristics (i.e., fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity) were employed to investigate the relationships between the number of PVT lapses and the diffusion characteristics. A hierarchical linear regression model was then used to assess the contributions of tract-specific FA values in predicting PVT lapses. Finally, dichotomized analysis was used to investigate white matter (WM) differences between resilient and vulnerable groups. Our results showed significant negative correlations between numbers of PVT lapses and FA in multiple WM tracts, with the FA variations in the superior longitudinal fasciculus and splenium of the corpus callosum accounting for nearly 37.5% of individual variability in PVT lapses. In addition, dichotomized analyses indicated that the resilient participants exhibited significantly higher FA values compared with the vulnerable participants. Together, these findings suggest that cognitive instability after SD was closely associated with individual differences in WM integrity.

AB  - Abstract
Children and adolescents have the highest rates of traumatic brain injury (TBI), with mild TBI (mTBI) accounting for most of these injuries. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable and often suffer from post-injury symptomologies that may persist for months. We hypothesized that the combination of resveratrol (RES), prebiotic fiber (PBF), and omega-3 fatty acids (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) would be an effective therapeutic supplement for the mitigation of mTBI outcomes in the developing brain. Adolescent male and female Sprague–Dawley rats were randomly assigned to the supplement (3S) or control condition, which was followed by a mTBI or sham insult. A behavioral test battery designed to examine symptomologies commonly associated with mTBI was administered. Following the test battery, tissue was collected from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and primary auditory cortex for Golgi-Cox analysis of spine density, and for changes in expression of 6 genes (Aqp4, Gfap, Igf1, Nfl, Sirt1, and Tau). 3S treatment altered the behavioral performance of sham animals indicating that dietary manipulations modify premorbid characteristics. 3S treatment prevented injury-related deficits in the longer-term behavior measures, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) spine density, and levels of Aqp4, Gfap, Igf1, Nfl, and Sirt1 expression in the PFC. Although not fully protective, treatment with the supplement significantly improved post-mTBI function and warrants further investigation.

AB  - Abstract
The primary sensory cortex exhibits neuroplastic changes responding to sensory disturbances, and GABAergic synaptic transmission plays a critical role in the regulation of plasticity. The insular cortex (IC) integrates orofacial nociceptive signals conveyed via myelinated Aδ- and unmyelinated C-fibers. However, it has been unknown whether a disturbance of nociceptive inputs, such as a deletion of the peripheral nerves, alters GABAergic local circuit in IC. The present study elucidated GABAergic synaptic transmission in the model rat whose C-fibers were ablated by capsaicin injection 1–2 days after birth. In vivo optical imaging revealed that capsaicin-treated rats showed a facilitative excitatory propagation in IC responding to dental pulp stimulation. Whole-cell patch-clamp recording from pyramidal neurons (Pyr) demonstrated that capsaicin-treated rats showed the smaller amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) than sham-treated rats without changing the frequency. Furthermore, replacement of extracellular Ca2+ to Sr2+, which induces an asynchronous release of neurotransmitters in the quantal size, induced a smaller amplitude of asynchronous unitary IPSCs recorded from fast-spiking GABAergic interneuron to Pyr connections in capsaicin-treated rats than sham-treated rats. These results suggest that capsaicin treatment depresses IPSCs via a postsynaptic mechanism. To confirm this possibility, the variance-mean analysis of unitary IPSCs was employed and we found that quantal size of GABAergic synaptic transmission was smaller in capsaicin-treated rats than in sham-treated rats. These results suggest that ablation of C-fibers induces plastic changes in GABAergic synaptic transmission by decreasing postsynaptic GABAA receptor-mediated conductance, which is a possible mechanism of the facilitative excitation in IC of capsaicin-treated rats.

AB  - Abstract
Mutant SOD1 causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) by a dominant gain of toxicity. Previous studies have demonstrated therapeutic potential of mutant SOD1-RNAi delivered by intrathecal (IT) injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV). However, optimization of delivery is needed to overcome the high degree of variation in the transduction efficiency and therapeutic efficacy. Here, on the basis of our previously defined, efficient IT injection method, we investigated the influence of injection speed on transduction efficiency in the central nervous system (CNS). We demonstrate that slow IT injection results in higher transduction of spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) while fast IT injection leads to higher transduction of brain and peripheral organs. To test how these effects influence the outcome of RNAi therapy, we used slow and fast IT injection to deliver rAAVrh10-GFP-amiR-SOD1, a rAAV vector that expresses GFP and an artificial miRNA targeting SOD1, in SOD1-G93A mice. Both slow and fast IT injection produced therapeutic efficacy but the slow injection trended slightly toward a better outcome than the fast injection. These results demonstrate that IT injection speed influences the predominance of gene delivery at different CNS sites and should be taken into consideration in future therapeutic trials involving IT injection.

AB  - Abstract
Hippocampal neurogenesis and associated cognitive behaviors are regulated by a number of factors including stress, inflammation, and exercise. However, the interplay between these factors remains relatively unexplored, especially across the lifespan. In the current study, the effect of social isolation stress during the adolescent period on neurogenesis and hippocampal-dependent cognitive behaviors was examined. This period of the lifespan has been demonstrated to be an important time for hippocampal growth and plasticity, during which changes to hippocampal neurogenesis may have long lasting effects. Additionally, we aimed to determine whether a ‘dual-hit’ of adolescent stress and adult chronic neuroinflammation would potentiate any negative effects of either insult alone. Lastly, the potential positive effects of exercise during adolescence was examined to determine whether exercise could attenuate any negative impacts of these insults on hippocampal neurogenesis and behavior. The results from the current study demonstrate that social isolation stress during adolescence followed by intra-hippocampal exposure to the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β in early adulthood produces deficits in both spontaneous alternations and novel object recognition. Exercise attenuated deficits in neurogenesis and novel object recognition in mice that had been exposed to the ‘dual-hit’ of stress and neuroinflammation. These findings indicate that adolescence represents a key period of the lifespan during which external factors such as stress and exercise can impact on hippocampal development, and may alter the response to challenges such as neuroinflammation in later life.

AB  - Abstract
GLT-1 is mainly expressed in astrocytes and has a crucial role in glutamate uptake. Sonic hedgehog (SHH) can inhibit glutamate uptake and its pathway is activated in many brain diseases related with glutamate excitotoxicity. However, whether SHH regulates GLT-1 to affect glutamate uptake is not clear. Here, we use pharmacological and genetic methods to show that SHH induces GLT-1 degradation in astrocytes in a manner that is dependent on PKC delta (PKCδ) to regulate GLT-1 activities. GLT-1 protein levels are reduced as early as 2 hs in astrocytes after incubation with SHH, whereas its mRNA levels are not changed. This reduction is recapitulated when astrocytes are transfected with SmoA1, a constitutively active form of Smoothened (Smo), the mediator of SHH pathway. The reduction of GLT-1 and inhibition of aspartate current are not observed when staurosporine (STP) and BisindolylmaleimideII (BisII), agents known as PKC inhibitors, are present. Further, when PKCδ is knocked down in astrocytes, SHH cannot reduce GLT-1 protein levels. Therefore, SHH induces degradation of GLT-1 through PKCδ to regulate its activities.

AB  - Abstract
Little is known about how proprioceptive signals arising from muscles reach to higher brain regions such as the cerebral cortex. We have recently shown that a particular thalamic region, the caudo-ventromedial edge (VPMcvm) of ventral posteromedial thalamic nucleus (VPM), receives the proprioceptive signals from jaw-closing muscle spindles (JCMSs) in rats. In this study, we further addressed how the orofacial thalamic inputs from the JCMSs were transmitted from the thalamus (VPMcvm) to the cerebral cortex in rats. Injections of a retrograde and anterograde neuronal tracer, wheat-germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP), into the VPMcvm demonstrated that the thalamic pathway terminated mainly in a rostrocaudally narrow area in the dorsal part of granular insular cortex rostroventrally adjacent to the rostralmost part of the secondary somatosensory cortex (dGIrvs2). We also electrophysiologically confirmed that the dGIrvs2 received the proprioceptive inputs from JCMSs. To support the anatomical evidence of the VPMcvm–dGIrvs2 pathway, injections of a retrograde neuronal tracer Fluorogold into the dGIrvs2 demonstrated that the thalamic neurons projecting to the dGIrvs2 were confined in the VPMcvm and the parvicellular part of ventral posterior nucleus. In contrast, WGA-HRP injections into the lingual nerve area of core VPM demonstrated that axon terminals were mainly labeled in the core regions of the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, which were far from the dGIrvs2. These results suggest that the dGIrvs2 is a specialized cortical region receiving the orofacial proprioceptive inputs. Functional contribution of the revealed JCMSs–VPMcvm–dGIrvs2 pathway to Tourette syndrome is also discussed.
