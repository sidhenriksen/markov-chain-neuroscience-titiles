AB  - Abstract
This review covers the main principles of the Lund concept for treatment of severe traumatic brain injury. This is followed by a description of results of clinical studies in which this therapy or a modified version of the therapy has been used. Unlike other guidelines, which are based on meta-analytical approaches, important components of the Lund concept are based on physiological mechanisms for regulation of brain volume and brain perfusion and to reduce transcapillary plasma leakage and the need for plasma volume expanders. There have been nine non-randomized and two randomized outcome studies with the Lund concept or modified versions of the concept. The non-randomized studies indicated that the Lund concept is beneficial for outcome. The two randomized studies were small but showed better outcome in the groups of patients treated according to the modified principles of the Lund concept than in the groups given a more conventional treatment.

AB  - Abstract
The lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) constitutes a large component of the hypothalamus, and has been implicated in several aspects of motivated behavior. The LHA is of particular relevance to behavioral state control and the maintenance of arousal. Due to the cellular heterogeneity of this region, however, only some subpopulations of LHA cells have been properly anatomically characterized. Here, we have focused on cells expressing thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), a peptide found in the LHA that has been implicated as a promoter of arousal. Immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization were used to map the LHA TRH population in the rat, and cells were observed to form a large ventral cluster that extended throughout almost the entire rostro-caudal axis of the hypothalamus. Almost no examples of coexistence were seen when sections were double-stained for TRH and markers of other LHA populations, including the peptides hypocretin/orexin, melanin-concentrating hormone and neurotensin. In the juxtaparaventricular area, however, a discrete group of TRH-immunoreactive cells were also stained with antisera against enkephalin and urocortin 3. Innervation from the metabolically sensitive hypothalamic arcuate nucleus was investigated by double-staining for peptide markers of the two centrally projecting groups of arcuate neurons, agouti gene-related peptide and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, respectively; both populations of terminals were observed forming close appositions on TRH cells in the LHA. The present study indicates that TRH-expressing cells form a unique population in the LHA that may serve as a link between metabolic signals and the generation of arousal.

AB  - AbstractBackground
Depressive symptoms are frequent in idiopathic restless legs syndrome (RLS). However, little is known, so far, about the neurological basis. The present study aimed to explore the neuroanatomical anomalies in depressed drug-naïve RLS patients using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis.
Methods
We recruited 16 drug-naïve idiopathic RLS patients with depressive symptoms (RLS-D), 18 drug-naïve idiopathic RLS patients without depressive symptoms (RLS-ND), and 18 normal controls. All participants underwent structural MRI scans on a 3-T MR system. The differences in regional gray matter (GM) density were determined across groups by VBM8. Additional regression analysis was used to identify any associations between regional GM density and clinical symptoms.
Results
GM density of the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was significantly reduced in RLS-D patients when compared to RLS-ND patients or to the healthy controls. However, there were no significant differences of GM density either when the whole RLS group or the RLS-ND group was compared to healthy controls, respectively. Particularly, we found GM density of right ACC was negatively correlated with the severity and duration of depressive symptoms in RLS-D patients.
Conclusions
Depressive symptoms are associated with GM anomalies in ACC in patients with RLS. We propose that ACC is perhaps an important neuroimaging marker for facilitating treatment strategies in patients with RLS when assessing depressive symptoms.

AB  - Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a frequent and clinically highly heterogeneous neurological disorder with large socioeconomic consequences. NeuroAid (MLC601 and MLC901), a Traditional Medicine used in China for patients after stroke has been previously reported to induce neuroprotection and neuroplasticity. This study was designed to evaluate the neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects of MLC901 in a rat model of TBI. TBI was induced by a moderate lateral fluid percussion applied to the right parietal cortex. MLC901 was injected intraperitoneally at 2 h post-TBI, and then administered in drinking water at a concentration of 10 mg/ml until sacrifice of the animals. The cognitive deficits induced by TBI were followed by using the “what-where-when” task, which allows the measurement of episodic-like memory. MLC901 treatment decreased brain lesions induced by TBI. It prevented the serum increase of S-100 beta (S100B) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE), which may be markers to predict the neurologic outcome in human patients with TBI. MLC901 reduced the infarct volume when injected up to 2 h post-TBI, prevented edema formation and assisted its resolution, probably via the regulation of aquaporin 4. These positive MLC901 effects were associated with an upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as well as an increase of endogenous hippocampal neurogenesis and gliogenesis around the lesion. Furthermore, MLC901 reduced cognitive deficits induced by TBI. Rats subjected to TBI displayed a suppression of temporal order memory, which was restored by MLC901. This work provides evidence that MLC901 has neuroprotective and neurorestorative actions, which lead to an improvement in the recovery of cognitive functions in a model of traumatic brain injury.

AB  - Abstract
Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8), a brain–gut peptide, plays an important role in several opioid addictive behaviors. We previously reported that CCK-8 attenuated the expression and reinstatement of morphine-induced conditioned place preference. The possible effects of CCK-8 on the negative affective components of drug abstinence are not clear. There are no studies evaluating the effect of CCK-8 on emotional symptoms, such as anxiety, in morphine-withdrawal animals. We investigated the effects of CCK-8 on the anxiety-like behavior in morphine-withdrawal rats using an elevated plus-maze. Morphine withdrawal elicited time-dependent anxiety-like behaviors with peak effects on day 10 (5 days after induction of morphine dependence). Treatment with CCK-8 (0.1 and 1 μg, i.c.v.) blocked this anxiety in a dose-dependent fashion. A CCK1 receptor antagonist (L-364,718, 10 μg, i.c.v.) blocked the effect of CCK-8. Mu-opioid receptor antagonism with CTAP (10 μg, i.c.v.) decreased the ‘anxiolytic’ effect. CCK-8 inhibited anxiety-like behaviors in morphine-withdrawal rats by up-regulating endogenous opioids via the CCK1 receptor in rats. This study clearly identifies a distinct function of CCK-8 and a potential medication target of central CCK1 receptors for drugs aimed at ameliorating drug addiction.

AB  - Abstract
Complex molecular and cellular mechanisms regulate G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). It is suggested that proteins intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are to play a role in GPCR’s intra and extracellular regions plasticity, due to their potential for post-translational modification and interaction with other proteins. These regions are defined as lacking a stable three-dimensional (3D) structure. They are rich in hydrophilic and charged, amino acids and are capable to assume different conformations which allow them to interact with multiple partners. In this study we analyzed 75 GPCR involved in synaptic transmission using computational tools for sequence-based prediction of IDRs within a protein. We also evaluated putative ligand-binding motifs using receptor sequences. The disorder analysis indicated that neurotransmitter GPCRs have a significant amount of disorder in their N-terminus, third intracellular loop (3IL) and C-terminus. About 31%, 39% and 53% of human GPCR involved in synaptic transmission are disordered in these regions. Thirty-three percent of receptors show at least one predicted PEST motif, this being statistically greater than the estimate for the rest of human GPCRs. About 90% of the receptors had at least one putative site for dimerization in their 3IL or C-terminus. ELM instances sampled in these domains were 14-3-3, SH3, SH2 and PDZ motifs. In conclusion, the increased flexibility observed in GPCRs, added to the enrichment of linear motifs, PEST and heteromerization sites, may be critical for the nervous system’s functional plasticity.

AB  - Abstract
Besides dopaminergic (DA-ergic) neurons having all enzymes of DA synthesis, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), “monoenzymatic” neurons expressing only one of them were found in the brain, mostly in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH). The aim of this study was to test our hypothesis that DA is synthesized by monoenzymatic neurons, i.e. l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA), which produced in the monoenzymatic TH neurons is transported in the monoenzymatic AADC neurons for DA synthesis. Incubation of MBH in Krebs-Ringer solution with l-leucine, a competitive inhibitor of l-DOPA uptake, was used to prevent a hypothetical l-DOPA capture into AADC-containing neurons. Incubation of the substantia nigra containing DA-ergic neurons under the same conditions served as the control. According to our data, the l-leucine administration provoked a decrease of DA concentration in MBH and in the incubation medium but not in the substantia nigra and respective incubation medium, showing a decrease of cooperative synthesis of DA in MBH. This conclusion was supported by an observation of higher concentration of l-DOPA in the incubation medium under perfusion of MBH with Krebs-Ringer solution containing tolcapone, an inhibitor of catechol-O-methyltransferase, and l-leucine than under perfusion with the same solution, but without l-leucine. Functional interaction between monoenzymatic TH and AADC neurons was indirectly confirmed by finding in electron microscopy their close relations in MBH. Besides monoenzymatic AADC neurons, any AADC-possessing neurons, catecholaminergic and serotoninergic, apparently, could participate in DA synthesis together with monoenzymatic TH neurons. This idea was confirmed by the observation of close topographic relations between monoenzymatic TH neurons and those containing both enzymes, i.e. DA-ergic, noradrenergic or adrenergic. Thus, monoenzymatic neurons possessing TH or AADC and being in close topographic relations can synthesize DA in cooperation.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic exposure to alcohol produces changes in the prefrontal cortex that are thought to contribute to the development and maintenance of alcoholism. A large body of literature suggests that stress hormones play a critical role in this process. Here we review the bi-directional relationship between alcohol and stress hormones, and discuss how alcohol acutely stimulates the release of glucocorticoids and induces enduring modifications to neuroendocrine stress circuits during the transition from non-dependent drinking to alcohol dependence. We propose a pathway by which alcohol and stress hormones elicit neuroadaptive changes in prefrontal circuitry that could contribute functionally to a dampened neuroendocrine state and the increased propensity to relapse—a spiraling trajectory that could eventually lead to dependence.

AB  - Abstract
In the mammalian cerebellum, deep cerebellar nuclear (DCN) cells convey all information from cortical Purkinje cells (PCs) to premotor nuclei and other brain regions. However, how DCN cells integrate inhibitory input from PCs with excitatory inputs from other sources has been difficult to assess, in part due to the large spatial separation between cortical PCs and their target cells in the nuclei. To circumvent this problem we have used a Cre-mediated genetic approach to generate mice in which channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), fused with a fluorescent reporter, is selectively expressed by GABAergic neurons, including PCs. In recordings from brain slice preparations from this model, mammalian PCs can be robustly depolarized and discharged by brief photostimulation. In recordings of postsynaptic DCN cells, photostimulation of PC axons induces a strong inhibition that resembles these cells’ responses to focal electrical stimulation, but without a requirement for the glutamate receptor blockers typically applied in such experiments. In this optogenetic model, laser pulses as brief as 1 ms can reliably induce an inhibition that shuts down the spontaneous spiking of a DCN cell for ∼50 ms. If bursts of such brief light pulses are delivered, a fixed pattern of bistable bursting emerges. If these pulses are delivered continuously to a spontaneously bistable cell, the immediate response to such photostimulation is inhibitory in the cell’s depolarized state and excitatory when the membrane has repolarized; a less regular burst pattern then persists after stimulation has been terminated. These results indicate that the spiking activity of DCN cells can be bidirectionally modulated by the optically activated synaptic inhibition of cortical PCs.

AB  - Abstract
Stressful events promote a wide range of neurotransmitter and neuroendocrine changes, which likely serve in an adaptive capacity. However, with repeated stressor exposure, behavioral disturbances, such as anxiety and depression, may develop. Moreover, re-exposure to a stressor for some time following an initial aversive experience may instigate especially pronounced neurochemical variations that favor the emergence of depression and anxiety. These outcomes may stem from any number of neurobiological changes, but increasing attention has focused on the potential contribution of inflammatory factors, such as cytokines. Given the distinct differences in stressor responsiveness that have been reported between males and females, alongside a much higher rate of mood disorders in females, we sought to examine whether repeated exposure to stressors would differentially influence elevated plus-maze behavior in male and female CD-1 mice, and whether such changes would be paralleled by variations of pro-inflammatory mRNA cytokine expression within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus. In males, the sensitization of interleukin (IL)-1β was evident in both brain regions in those mice that had initially been stressed and then 6 weeks later re-exposed to a stressor exhibiting higher IL-1β expression than did mice stressed on only a single occasion. Females demonstrated higher baseline expression of cytokine expression within the hippocampus, but neither a single exposure nor re-exposure stressor treatment produced significant cytokine elevations. In the PFC an acute stressor treatment increased IL-1R expression, but otherwise had little effect. In a plus-maze test, stressed male mice displayed markedly reduced latencies to the open arms that was evident in a test 6 weeks later irrespective of whether mice were re-exposed to a stressor, whereas in females this outcome was less evident. These studies are consistent with the perspective that female mice are relatively resilient toward stressor-induced cytokine elevations even though in humans females are generally more prone to developing mood disturbances.

AB  - Abstract
Adolescents display increased vulnerability to engage in drug experimentation. This is often considered a risk factor for later drug abuse. In this scenario, the permanent effects of cocaine exposure during adolescence on anxiety levels and stress responsivity, which may result in behavioral phenotypes prone to addiction, are now starting to be unveiled. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the long-lasting effects of chronic cocaine administration during adolescence, on anxiety-like behavior and on stress response. Adolescent male Wistar rats were daily administered 45-mg cocaine/kg of body weight in three equal intraperitoneal doses with 1-h interval, from postnatal day (PND) 35 to 50. The effects of cocaine administration on anxiety levels, assessed in the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), and on social stress response, assessed in the resident–intruder paradigm (R/I), were evaluated 10 days after withdrawal, when rats were reaching the adulthood. The underlying dopaminergic activity, and the corticosterone and testosterone levels were determined. Our results showed that cocaine induced long-lasting alterations in the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenals (HPA) axis function and in testosterone levels. Such alterations resulted in significant and enduring changes in behavioral responses to environmental challenges, such as the EPM and R/I, including the evaluation of potential threats that may lead to high-risk behavior and low-benefit choices. This was further supported by an altered dopaminergic function in the amygdala and hippocampus. The present findings provide new insights into how the use of cocaine during adolescent development may modulate emotional behavior later in life. Compromised ability to recognize and deal with potential threats is an important risk factor to perpetuate compulsive drug seeking and relapse susceptibility.

AB  - Abstract
The functions of the D1- and D2-dopamine receptors in the basal ganglia have remained somewhat enigmatic, with a number of competing theories relating to the interactions of the ‘direct’ and ‘indirect pathways’. Computational models have been good at simulating properties of the system, but are typically divorced from the underlying neural architecture. In this article we propose a new model which re-addresses response selection at the level of the basal ganglia. At the core of this response selection system the D1 DA receptor-expressing striatal pathways ‘prepare’ the set of possible appropriate responses. The D2DR-expressing striatal pathways then shape and ‘select’ from this initial response set framework.

AB  - Abstract
Multiple sclerosis and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), are crucially dependent on the invasion of activated autoreactive lymphocytes and blood macrophages into the central nervous system (CNS). Proinflammatory mononuclear cells and activated local microglia mediate inflammation, demyelination and axonal damage at the target organ. Previously, we observed that the administration of a hybrid between the synapsin ABC domains and the B subunit of Escherichia coli heat labile-enterotoxin (LTBABC) to rats with EAE ameliorated disease by modulating the peripheral Th1 response to myelin basic protein (MBP). In the present study, we investigated the effect of LTBABC administration on proinflammatory cell frequency in the CNS of rats with EAE. Treatment with the hybrid in the inductive phase of EAE attenuated disease severity and diminished histological inflammatory infiltrates and demyelination in the spinal cord of rats with acute EAE. Lower frequencies of infiltrating and local macrophages as well as CD4+ T cells that produce the proinflammatory cytokines interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and interleukin (IL)-17 were found at the target organ. Concomitantly, low levels of INF-γ and IL-17 and increased levels of IL-10 were measured in cultures of CNS infiltrating cells and spinal cord tissue. An increased frequency of CD4+CD25+Foxp3 cells was observed at the disease peak and at the beginning of the recovery stage. These results provide further evidence for the immunomodulatory properties of the fusion protein LTBABC in autoimmune demyelinating disease affecting the central nervous system.

AB  - Abstract
Plasticity constitutes the basis of behavioral changes as a result of experience. It refers to neural network shaping and re-shaping at the global level and to synaptic contacts remodeling at the local level, either during learning or memory encoding, or as a result of acute or chronic pathological conditions. ‘Plastic’ brain reorganization after central nervous system lesions has a pivotal role in the recovery and rehabilitation of sensory and motor dysfunction, but can also be “maladaptive”. Moreover, it is clear that brain reorganization is not a “static” phenomenon but rather a very dynamic process. Spinal cord injury immediately initiates a change in brain state and starts cortical reorganization. In the long term, the impact of injury – with or without accompanying therapy – on the brain is a complex balance between supraspinal reorganization and spinal recovery. The degree of cortical reorganization after spinal cord injury is highly variable, and can range from no reorganization (i.e. “silencing”) to massive cortical remapping. This variability critically depends on the species, the age of the animal when the injury occurs, the time after the injury has occurred, and the behavioral activity and possible therapy regimes after the injury. We will briefly discuss these dependencies, trying to highlight their translational value. Overall, it is not only necessary to better understand how the brain can reorganize after injury with or without therapy, it is also necessary to clarify when and why brain reorganization can be either “good” or “bad” in terms of its clinical consequences. This information is critical in order to develop and optimize cost-effective therapies to maximize functional recovery while minimizing maladaptive states after spinal cord injury.

AB  - Abstract
Central noradrenergic (NA) signaling contributes critically to multiple behavioral effects of cocaine administration, particularly stress- and anxiety-related effects. The present study examined the ability of acute cocaine to induce the immediate early gene product, cFos, in NA neurons and stress-related neural circuits in rats that were cocaine-naïve, or had a history of cocaine self-administration with or without extinction. Rats implanted with jugular catheters were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.5-mg/kg/infusion), with a subset subsequently trained on extinction. Cocaine-naïve controls were handled daily. After a final day of self-administration, extinction, or handling, rats received an i.p. injection of either cocaine (20-mg/kg) or saline, and 90 min later were anesthetized and perfused. Tissue sections were processed for immunoperoxidase labeling of nuclear cFos with either immunoperoxidase or immunofluorescent cytoplasmic labeling of dopamine beta hydroxylase or tyrosine hydroxylase. Acute cocaine increased the number of activated NA neurons within the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS; A2 cell group) in cocaine-naïve and extinguished rats, but not in rats that only self-administered. Extinction attenuated cocaine-induced cFos activation in NA neurons of the caudal ventrolateral medulla (A1/C1 cell groups), and attenuated cFos within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the apex of the central neuroendocrine stress axis. Cocaine consistently increased cFos in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, regardless of history. NA neurons of the locus coeruleus (A6 cell group) were not activated after cocaine administration in any experimental group. Thus, the ability of cocaine to activate central stress circuitry is altered after cocaine self-administration. Our results suggest a unique role for the NTS in cocaine-induced reinstatement, as extinction training enhanced the ability of cocaine to activate NA neurons within this region. These findings suggest central NA systems originating in the caudal brainstem as potential targets for the treatment of cocaine addiction.

AB  - Abstract
Melatonin, an indoleamine hormone secreted into circulation at night primarily by the brain’s pineal gland, has been shown to have a wide variety of actions on the development and physiology of neurons in the CNS. Acting via two G-protein-coupled membrane receptors (MT1 and MT2), melatonin modulates neurogenesis, synaptic functions, neuronal cytoskeleton and gene expression. In the present studies, we sought to characterize the behavior and neuronal biology of transgenic mice lacking both of these melatonin receptors as a way to understand the hormone’s receptor versus non-receptor-mediated actions in CNS-dependent activities, such as learning and memory, anxiety, general motor performance and circadian rhythmicity. Assessment of these behaviors was complemented by molecular analyses of gene expression in the brain. Our results demonstrate mild behavioral hyperactivity and a lengthened circadian period of free-running motor activity in melatonin receptor-deficient mice as compared to receptor-intact control mice beginning at an early age. Significant improvement in cognitive performance was found using the Barnes Maze and the Y-Maze. No behavioral changes in anxiety levels were found. Electrophysiological measures in hippocampal slices revealed a clear enhancement of long-term potentiation in mice lacking melatonin receptors with no significant differences in paired-pulse facilitation. Quantitative analysis of brain protein expression levels of phosphoCREB and phosphoERK1/2 and key markers of synaptic activity (synapsin, glutamate receptor 1, spinophilin, and glutamic acid decarboxylase 1) revealed significant differences between the double-knockout and wild-type animals, consistent with the behavioral findings. Thus, genetic deletion of melatonin receptors produces mice with enhanced cognitive and motor performance, supporting the view that these receptors play an important role in neurobehavioral development.

AB  - Abstract
In sentences such as dogs cannot fly/bark, evaluation of the truth-value of the sentence is assumed to appear after the negation has been integrated into the sentence structure. Moreover negation processing and truth-value processing are considered effortful processes, whereas processing of the semantic relatedness of the words within sentences is thought to occur automatically. In the present study, modulation of event-related brain potentials (N400 and late positive potential, LPP) was investigated during an implicit task (silent listening) and active truth-value evaluation to test these theoretical assumptions and determine if truth-value evaluation will be modulated by the way participants processed the negated information implicitly prior to truth-value verification. Participants first listened to negated sentences and then evaluated these sentences for their truth-value in an active evaluation task. During passive listening, the LPP was generally more pronounced for targets in false negative (FN) than true negative (TN) sentences, indicating enhanced attention allocation to semantically-related but false targets. N400 modulation by truth-value (FN &gt; TN) was observed in 11 out of 24 participants. However, during active evaluation, processing of semantically-unrelated but true targets (TN) elicited larger N400 and LPP amplitudes as well as a pronounced frontal negativity. This pattern was particularly prominent in those 11 individuals, whose N400 modulation during silent listening indicated that they were more sensitive to violations of the truth-value than to semantic priming effects. The results provide evidence for implicit truth-value processing during silent listening of negated sentences and for task dependence related to inter-individual differences in implicit negation processing.

AB  - Abstract
The process of glutamate release, activity, and reuptake involves the astrocyte, the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. Glutamate is released into the synapse and may occupy and activate receptors on both neurons and astrocytes. Glutamate is rapidly removed from the synapse by a family of plasma membrane excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs), also localized to neurons and astrocytes. The purpose of the present study was to examine EAAT labeling in the postmortem human cortex at the light and electron microscopic (EM) levels. The postmortem prefrontal cortex was processed for EAAT1 and EAAT2 immunohistochemistry. At the light microscopic level, EAAT1 and EAAT2 labeling was found in both gray and white matter. Most cellular labeling was in small cells which were morphologically similar to glia. In addition, EAAT1-labeled neurons were scattered throughout, some of which were pyramidal in shape. At the EM level, EAAT1 and EAAT2 labeling was found in astrocytic soma and processes surrounding capillaries. EAAT labeling was also found in small astrocytic processes adjacent to axon terminals forming asymmetric (glutamatergic) synapses. While EAAT2 labeling was most prevalent in astrocytic processes, EAAT1 labeling was also present in neuronal processes including the soma, axons, and dendritic spines. Expression of EAAT1 protein on neurons may be due to the hypoxia associated with the postmortem interval, and requires further confirmation. The localization of EAATs on the astrocytic plasma membrane and adjacent to excitatory synapses is consistent with the function of facilitating glutamate reuptake and limiting glutamate spillover. Establishment that EAAT1 and EAAT2 can be measured at the EM level in human postmortem tissues will permit testing of hypotheses related to these molecules in diseases lacking analogous animal models.

AB  - Abstract
Compared to DBA/2J (D2), C57BL/6J (B6) inbred mice exhibit strong morphine preference when tested using a two-bottle choice drinking paradigm. A morphine preference quantitative trait locus (QTL), Mop2, was originally mapped to proximal chromosome (Chr) 10 using a B6xD2 F2 intercross population, confirmed with reciprocal congenic strains and fine mapped with recombinant congenic strains. These efforts identified a ∼10-Million base pair (Mbp) interval, underlying Mop2, containing 35 genes. To further reduce the interval, mice from the D2.B6-Mop2-P1 congenic strain were backcrossed to parental D2 mice and two new recombinant strains of interest were generated: D2.B6-Mop2-P1.pD.dB and D2.B6-Mop2-P1.pD.dD. Results obtained from testing these strains in the two-bottle choice drinking paradigm suggest that the gene(s) responsible for the Mop2 QTL is one or more of 22 remaining within the newly defined interval (∼7.6 Mbp) which includes Oprm1 and several other genes related to opioid pharmacology. Real-time qRT-PCR analysis of Oprm1 and opioid-related genes Rgs17, Ppp1r14c, Vip, and Iyd revealed both between-strain and within-strain expression differences in comparisons of saline- and morphine-treated B6 and D2 mice. Analysis of Rgs17 protein levels also revealed both between-strain and within-strain differences in comparisons of saline- and morphine-treated B6 and D2 mice. Results suggest that the Mop2 QTL represents the combined influence of multiple genetic variants on morphine preference in these two strains. Relative contributions of each variant remain to be determined.

AB  - Abstract
Dopamine (DA) midbrain neurons project to several striatal and cortical target areas and are essentially involved in a puzzling variety of important brain functions such as action selection and motor performance, motivation and reward-based learning, but also working memory and cognition. These neurons act via the release of their (main) neurotransmitter, dopamine, which binds to metabotropic dopamine receptors of the D1 or D2 type on target neurons. Axonal but also dendritic dopamine release is essentially controlled by calcium-triggered exocytosis of dopamine-filled synaptic vesicles primarily driven by electrical activity of the dopamine neuron, which generates patterns of actions potentials in the somato-dendritic domain and distributes them along its axonal tree. Thus, recording the behaviorally relevant pattern of electrical activity in DA neurons and identifying the underlying biophysical mechanisms that integrate afferent synaptic inputs and intrinsic excitability constitute a crucial element for defining the physiological roles of the midbrain DA system. Electrical activity of midbrain DA neurons in vivo is characterized by tonic background activity in a narrow frequency range (ca. 1–8 Hz) interrupted by either transient (i.e. phasic, &lt;500 ms) sequences of high-frequency firing (&gt;15 Hz), so called “bursts”, or transient pauses of electrical activity, where DA neurons generate no action potentials. This review focuses on the properties of these phasic activity changes in midbrain DA neurons. It updates recent progress on the expanding behavioral contexts, associated with phasic electrical activity in DA neurons beyond the classical (canonical) reward prediction error model. The review also highlights recently defined contributions of synaptic inputs for burst and pause generation and the roles of distinct postsynaptic ion channels in midbrain DA neurons.

AB  - Abstract
Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by overactivity, impulsiveness and attentional problems, including an increase in distractibility. A structure that is intimately linked with distractibility is the superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain sensory structure which plays a particular role in the production of eye and head movements. Although others have proposed the involvement of such diverse elements as the frontal cortex and forebrain noradrenaline in ADHD, given the role of the colliculus in distractibility and the increased distractibility in ADHD, we have proposed that distractibility in ADHD arises due to collicular sensory hyper-responsiveness. To further investigate this possibility, we recorded the extracellular activity (multi-unit (MUA) and local field potential (LFP)) in the superficial visual layers of the SC in an animal model of ADHD, the New Zealand genetically hypertensive (GH) rat, in response to wholefield light flashes. The MUA and LFP peak amplitude and summed activity within a one-second time window post-stimulus were both significantly greater in GH rats than in Wistar controls, across the full range of stimulus intensities. Given that baseline firing rate did not differ between the strains, this suggests that the signal-to-noise ratio is elevated in GH animals. d-Amphetamine reduced the peak amplitude and summed activity of the multi-unit response in Wistar animals. It also reduced the peak amplitude and summed activity of the multi-unit response in GH animals, at higher doses bringing it down to levels that were equivalent to those of Wistar animals at baseline. The present results provide convergent evidence that a collicular dysfunction (sensory hyper-responsiveness) is present in ADHD, and that it may underlie the enhanced distractibility. In addition, d-amphetamine – a widely used treatment in ADHD – may have one of its loci of therapeutic action at the level of the colliculus.

In this review we summarize findings published over the past 10 years focusing on the neural correlates of perceptual decision-making. Importantly, this review highlights only studies that employ a model-based approach, i.e., they use quantitative cognitive models in combination with neuroscientific data. The model-based approach allows capturing latent decision-making processes such as strategic adjustments of response thresholds and relate these to interindividual differences or single-trial blood-oxygenated level dependent (BOLD) functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) responses. The review shows that different cortico-subcortical networks are responsive to different latent decision-making processes. More concretely, we show that evidence accumulation is associated with a fronto-parietal network which is partly overlapping with choice bias in perceptual decision making. The setting of decision thresholds is associated with fronto-basal ganglia networks which are also found for choice bias. In sum, we argue that the model-based approach holds great promises to understand the neural correlates of latent cognitive processes.

While estrogens are known to play a crucial role in the neurogenesis of the mammalian and avian brain, their role in teleost adult proliferation pattern is not yet fully understood. The present study aimed to determine the estrogen effects in adult brain proliferation zones, using zebrafish, as a model organism. Indeed, teleost fish brain provides a unique adult neurogenesis model, based on its extensive proliferation, contrasting the restricted adult telencephalic neurogenesis observed in birds and mammals. To determine the effect of estrogens, 17-β estradiol was administrated for 7 days in adult female zebrafish, followed by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence. Stereological analyses of the BrdU-positive cells within the neurogenic zones, showed region-specific decreases of actively proliferating cells in the estrogen-treated animals, compared to matched controls. Interestingly, the most prominent estradiol effects were found in the number of cycling cells of the ventral nucleus of ventral telencephalic area (Vv) and cerebellar areas. Significant decreases were also determined in the dorso-lateral telencephalic, preoptic and dorsal hypothalamic areas. In contrast, medial dorsal telencephalic, caudal (Hc) and ventral (Hv) hypothalamic areas were unaffected by estrogen treatment. The majority of the BrdU-labeled cells were found to co-express PCNA proliferating marker in Hc, Hv and Vv. Additionally, a population of proliferating cells co-expressed the early neuronal marker TOAD in all areas studied. These results provide significant evidence on the 17-β estradiol impact on adult neurogenesis, down-regulating the fast-cycling and post-mitotic cells within the female zebrafish brain neurogenetic zones.

AB  - Abstract
Neural networks ultimately arrive at functional output via interaction of the excitability of individual neurons and their synaptic interactions. We investigated the relationships between voltage-gated ion channel and neurotransmitter receptor mRNA levels in mouse spinal cord at four different postnatal time points (P5, P11, P17, and adult) and three different adult cord levels (cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral) using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Our analysis and data visualization are novel in that we chose a focal group of voltage-gated channel subunits and transmitter receptor subunits, performed absolute quantitation of mRNA copy number for each gene from a sample, and used multiple correlation analyses and correlation matrices to detect patterns in correlated mRNA levels across all genes of interest. These correlation profiles suggest that postnatal maturation of the spinal cord includes changes among channel and receptor subunits that proceed from widespread co-regulation to more refined and distinct functional relationships.

AB  - Abstract
Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) is known to control neuroinflammation, however the status of GSK3β in multiple sclerosis, the most common inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS, and its animal model EAE, is unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression of phosphorylated GSK3β, the inactive form of GSK3β, in the spinal cords of EAE mice. We demonstrate that while the expression of phosphorylated GSK3β was present in radial astrocytes and neurons of the control mice that received only complete Freund’s adjuvant, it was absent in radial astrocytes and significantly lower in neurons of EAE animals. The loss of phosphorylated GSK3β in radial glia and neurons in EAE spinal cords was concurrent with radial glia migration and astrogliosis. This disturbance in the expression of inactive GSK3β was recovered in neurons, but not in the radial glia, after treatment of EAE mice with adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells capable of inducing a Th2 shift. Collectively, our results suggest a link between inactive GSK3β and modulation of the immune responses during EAE. Thus, we propose that maintenance of GSK3β in its inactive status may play a role in preserving the normal physiology of the spinal cord and amelioration of EAE following stem cell therapy.

AB  - Abstract
The present study was designed to investigate possible involvement of the central amygdala (CeA) nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) and 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A) receptors in the reversal effect of nicotine and 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) on morphine-induced amnesia. Two guide cannulas were stereotaxically implanted in the CeA regions and a step-through passive avoidance task was used for the assessment of memory retrieval in adult male Wistar rats. Our results indicated that post-training s.c. administration of morphine (3–7-mg/kg) impaired memory retrieval. Pre-test administration of nicotine (0.3- and 0.5-mg/kg, s.c.) reversed morphine-induced amnesia. In addition, pre-test intra-CeA injection of MDMA (1–2-μg/rat) with an ineffective dose of nicotine (0.1-mg/kg, s.c.) improved memory retrieval, suggesting the interactive effect of the drugs on memory formation. It should be noted that that pre-test intra-CeA injection of 2-μg/rat of MDMA by itself produced amnesia. Interestingly, pre-test intra-CeA injection of mecamylamine, a nACh receptor antagonist (1–2-μg/rat) or (S)-WAY 100135 (0.25–1-μg/rat), a selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist inhibited the improvement of morphine-induced amnesia which was produced by pre-test co-injection of nicotine and MDMA. Pre-test intra-CeA injection of the same doses of MDMA, mecamylamine or (S)-WAY 100135 by itself had no effect on morphine-induced amnesia. Moreover, pre-test injection of the same doses of mecamylamine or (S)-WAY 100135 into the CeA alone could not change memory retrieval. Taken together, it can be concluded that there is a functional interaction between morphine, nicotine and MDMA via the CeA nicotinic and serotonergic receptor mechanisms in passive avoidance memory retrieval. Moreover, cross state-dependent memory retrieval may have been induced between the drugs and this probably depends on the rewarding effects of the drugs.

AB  - Abstract
We previously demonstrated that inactivation of Rho-kinase by hydroxyfasudil could impact N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) excitatory interneurons in the hippocampus and attenuate the spatial learning and memory dysfunction of rats caused by chronic forebrain hypoperfusion ischemia. Complementary interactions between the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA form the molecular basis of synaptic plasticity and cognitive performance. However, whether the GABAergic inhibitory interneurons are involved in the mechanisms underlying these processes remains unclear. Here, we further examined the role of GABAergic interneurons in the neuroprotective effect of the Rho-kinase inhibitor. Chronic forebrain ischemia was induced in Wistar rats by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCAO). The general synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampal CA3 neurons were evaluated at 30 days after sham surgery or BCAO. Real-time PCR and Western blot analyses were conducted to determine the effect of the Rho-kinase inhibitor hydroxyfasudil on GABAergic inhibitory interneuron expression and function after ischemia. Hydroxyfasudil showed no significant effect on general synaptic transmission, but it could abolish the inhibition of LTP induced by chronic forebrain ischemia. Moreover, the mRNA and protein levels of GABAA and GABAB in three brain regions after ischemia were markedly decreased, and hydroxyfasudil could up-regulate all mRNA and protein expression levels in these areas except for GABAA mRNA in the cerebral cortex and striatum. Using phosphorylation antibodies against specific sites on the GABAA and GABAB receptors, we further demonstrated that hydroxyfasudil could inhibit GABAergic interneuron phosphorylation triggered by the theta burst stimulation. In summary, our results indicated that the inactivation of Rho-kinase could enhance GABAA and GABAB expressions by different mechanisms to guarantee the induction of hippocampal LTP, and it could decrease the phosphorylation level of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons to promote the LTP induction rate and magnitude, hence improving the cognitive deficit suffered after chronic forebrain ischemia.

AB  - Abstract
Previous studies found that prostaglandins in skeletal muscle play a role in evoking the exercise pressor reflex; however the role played by prostaglandins in the spinal transmission of the reflex is not known. We determined, therefore, whether or not spinal blockade of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity and/or spinal blockade of endoperoxide (EP) 2 or 4 receptors attenuated the exercise pressor reflex in decerebrated rats. We first established that intrathecal doses of a non-specific COX inhibitor Ketorolac (100 μg in 10 μl), a COX-2-specific inhibitor Celecoxib (100 μg in 10 μl), an EP2 antagonist PF-04418948 (10 μg in 10 μl), and an EP4 antagonist L-161,982 (4 μg in 10 μl) effectively attenuated the pressor responses to intrathecal injections of arachidonic acid (100 μg in 10 μl), EP2 agonist Butaprost (4 ng in 10 μl), and EP4 agonist TCS 2510 (6.25 μg in 2.5 μl), respectively. Once effective doses were established, we statically contracted the hind limb before and after intrathecal injections of Ketorolac, Celecoxib, the EP2 antagonist and the EP4 antagonist. We found that Ketorolac significantly attenuated the pressor response to static contraction (before Ketorolac: 23 ± 5 mmHg, after Ketorolac 14 ± 5 mmHg; p &lt; 0.05) whereas Celecoxib had no effect. We also found that 8 μg of L-161,982, but not 4 μg of L-161,982, significantly attenuated the pressor response to static contraction (before L-161,982: 21 ± 4 mmHg, after L-161,982 12 ± 3 mmHg; p &lt; 0.05), whereas PF-04418948 (10 μg) had no effect. We conclude that spinal COX-1, but not COX-2, plays a role in evoking the exercise pressor reflex, and that the spinal prostaglandins produced by this enzyme are most likely activating spinal EP4 receptors, but not EP2 receptors.

AB  - Abstract
Visual exproprioception refers to information of the body relative to the environment and may be the critical piece of sensory information that explains why gait improvements can be achieved with visual step cues in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD). The primary aim of current study was to investigate the role of visual exproprioception in the positive effect of visual cues on gait in patients with PD. Nineteen individuals with PD and 15 healthy subjects participated in this study. Four conditions of self-paced gait were tested: normal walking, without exproprioception (exproprioceptive information of lower limbs removed), visual step length cues, and visual step length cues but without exproprioception. Gaze behavior, gait parameters and the accuracy and precision of foot placement on the visual cues were recorded. Individuals with PD improved step length in both cued conditions. Both groups fixated close to 46% on visual cues necessary to accomplish the next step (ongoing step), while 54% of fixations were focused on visual cues one or more steps ahead. Also, both groups increased absolute error and error variability of the foot placement around the visual cues without vision of their feet. These results suggest that exproprioceptive information is not critical to achieve step length and overall gait benefits with visual cues in PD, but is critical for the accuracy and precision of foot placement on targets. People with PD and healthy individuals use visual information from visual cues in both on-line and feedforward fashions. In conclusion, patients with PD likely focus attention on the discrete goal of each foot hitting a visual cue placed on the floor and then use the exteroceptive information (i.e. position of next foot placement location) to plan each step individually at a cortical level.

AB  - Abstract
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF, is one of the most important neurotrophic factors acting in the peripheral and central nervous system. In the auditory system its function was initially defined by using constitutive knockout mouse mutants and shown to be essential for survival of neurons and afferent innervation of hair cells in the peripheral auditory system. Further examination of BDNF null mutants also revealed a more complex requirement during re-innervation processes involving the efferent system of the cochlea. Using adult mouse mutants defective in BDNF signaling, it could be shown that a tonotopical gradient of BDNF expression within cochlear neurons is required for maintenance of a specific spatial innervation pattern of outer hair cells and inner hair cells. Additionally, BDNF is required for maintenance of voltage-gated potassium channels (KV) in cochlear neurons, which may form part of a maturation step within the ascending auditory pathway with onset of hearing and might be essential for cortical acuity of sound-processing and experience-dependent plasticity. A presumptive harmful role of BDNF during acoustic trauma and consequences of a loss of cochlear BDNF during aging are discussed in the context of a partial reversion of this maturation step. We compare the potentially beneficial and harmful roles of BDNF for the mature auditory system with those BDNF functions known in other sensory circuits, such as the vestibular, visual, olfactory, or somatosensory system.

AB  - Abstract
CNS white matter is subject to a novel form of neural plasticity which has been termed “myelin plasticity”. It is well established that oligodendrocyte generation and the addition of new myelin internodes continue throughout normal adulthood. These new myelin internodes maybe required for the de novo myelination of previously unmyelinated axons, myelin sheath replacement, or even myelin remodeling. Each process could alter axonal conduction velocity, but to what end? We review the changes that occur within the white matter over the lifetime, the known regulators and mediators of white matter plasticity in the mature CNS, and the physiological role this plasticity may play in CNS function.

AB  - Abstract
Hemokinin-1 (HK-1) is a peptide encoded by the preprotachykinin gene, TAC-4, and shares the hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal (C-terminal) region common to mammalian tachykinin peptides, such as substance P (SP). It is generally believed that C-terminal fragments of SP elicit an excitatory effect, while pretreatment with amino-terminal (N-terminal) fragments of SP inhibits the function of SP; however, there is no available information on HK-1. Therefore, to clarify the characteristics of C-terminal and N-terminal fragments of HK-1, HK-1 was divided into HK-1 (1–5) as the N-terminal fragment and HK-1 (6–11) as the C-terminal fragment based on the similarity of amino acids between HK-1 and SP. Intrathecal administration of HK-1 (6–11) induced scratching behavior similar to HK-1, while HK-1 (1–5) hardly induced scratching. Pretreatment with HK-1 (1–5), however, attenuated scratching induced by HK-1 and SP, whereas pretreatment with SP (1–5) attenuated SP-induced scratching, but not HK-1. Furthermore, intrathecal administration of HK-1 (1–5) and SP (1–5) markedly attenuated the induction of flinching and enhancement of c-Fos expression in the spinal cord following the intradermal administration of formalin, a noxious stimulant, while pretreatment with HK-1 (1–5), but not SP (1–5), markedly attenuated the induction of scratching behavior by subcutaneous administration of pruritic agents, such as serotonin or histamine. Taken together, these findings indicate that HK-1 (1–5) suppresses pruritic and nociceptive processing, while SP (1–5) suppresses nociceptive processing. Therefore, it is suggested that HK-1 (1–5) may be a useful tool for revealing pruritic processing and HK-1 may play a crucial role in pruritic processing.

Perceptual integration of sensory input from our two nostrils has received little attention in comparison to lateralized inputs for vision and hearing. Here, we investigated whether a binary odor mixture of eugenol and l-carvone (smells of cloves and caraway) would be perceived differently if presented as a mixture in one nostril (physical mixture), vs. the same two odorants in separate nostrils (dichorhinic mixture). In parallel, we investigated whether the different types of presentation resulted in differences in olfactory event-related potentials (OERP). Psychophysical ratings showed that the dichorhinic mixtures were perceived as more intense than the physical mixtures. A tendency for shift in perceived quality was also observed. In line with these perceptual changes, the OERP showed a shift in latencies and amplitudes for early (more “sensory”) peaks P1 and N1 whereas no significant differences were observed for the later (more “cognitive”) peak P2. The results altogether suggest that the peripheral level is a site of interaction between odorants. Both psychophysical ratings and, for the first time, electrophysiological measurements converge on this conclusion.

AB  - Abstract
The axons of transected and re-apposed vestibulocochlear nerve of the frog, in contrast to mammalian species, regenerate and establish functional contacts within their original termination areas of the vestibular nuclear complex and the cerebellum. The lack of regenerative capability of the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) is partially attributed to various extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules, such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG) and tenascin-R (TN-R), which exert inhibition on axon regeneration. In contrast to these molecules, hyaluronan (HA) was reported to be permissive for CNS regeneration. Using histochemical and immunohistochemical methods, we investigated the distribution pattern of these molecules in the medial (MVN), lateral (LVN), superior and descending vestibular nuclei and the cerebellum of the frog and detected regional differences in the organization of the ECM. In the vestibular nuclear complex, pericellular condensation of the ECM, the perineuronal nets (PNNs) were recognizable in the LVN and MVN and were positive only for HA. The neuropil of the vestibular nuclei showed either a diffuse appearance with varying intensity of reactions, or dots and ring-like structures, which may represent the perinodal ECM of the vestibular fibers. In the cerebellum, indistinct PNNs that were only labeled for HA were present in the granular layer. Our findings suggest that the HA-rich, but CSPG and TN-R-free PNNs may be associated with the high degree of plasticity and regenerative potential of the amphibian vestibular system.

AB  - Abstract
Conduction time is typically ignored in computational models of neural network function. Here we consider the effects of conduction delays on the synchrony of neuronal activity and neural oscillators, and evaluate the consequences of allowing conduction velocity (CV) to be regulated adaptively. We propose that CV variation, mediated by myelin, could provide an important mechanism of activity-dependent nervous system plasticity. Even small changes in CV, resulting from small changes in myelin thickness or nodal structure, could have profound effects on neuronal network function in terms of spike-time arrival, oscillation frequency, oscillator coupling, and propagation of brain waves. For example, a conduction delay of 5 ms could change interactions of two coupled oscillators at the upper end of the gamma frequency range (∼100 Hz) from constructive to destructive interference; delays smaller than 1 ms could change the phase by 30°, significantly affecting signal amplitude. Myelin plasticity, as another form of activity-dependent plasticity, is relevant not only to nervous system development but also to complex information processing tasks that involve coupling and synchrony among different brain rhythms. We use coupled oscillator models with time delays to explore the importance of adaptive time delays and adaptive synaptic strengths. The impairment of activity-dependent myelination and the loss of adaptive time delays may contribute to disorders where hyper- and hypo-synchrony of neuronal firing leads to dysfunction (e.g., dyslexia, schizophrenia, epilepsy).

AB  - Abstract
Endometriosis pain is a very common and extremely disabling condition whose mechanism is still poorly understood. While increased levels of leptin have been reported in patients with endometriosis, their contribution to endometriosis pain has not been explored. Using a rodent model of endometriosis we provide evidence for an estrogen-dependent contribution of leptin in endometriosis-induced pain. Rats implanted with autologous uterine tissue onto the gastrocnemius muscle developed endometriosis-like lesions and local chronic pain. Compared to eutopic uterine tissue, leptin mRNA and protein were up-regulated in the endometriosis-like lesions. Intramuscular injection of recombinant leptin in naive rats produced dose-dependent local mechanical hyperalgesia and nociceptor sensitization to mechanical stimulation. Ovariectomy attenuated the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by recombinant leptin, in rats treated with vehicle compared to those treated with 17β-estradiol replacement, at 1 and 24 h after leptin injection. Finally, intralesional injections of a pegylated leptin receptor (Ob-R) antagonist or of an inhibitor of Janus kinase2, which transduces the Ob-R signal, markedly attenuated pain in the endometriosis model. Taken together these data support the hypothesis that leptin, generated in ectopic endometrial lesions produces mechanical hyperalgesia by acting on nociceptors innervating the lesion. This sensitivity to leptin is dependent on estrogen levels. Thus, interventions targeting leptin signaling, especially in combination with interventions that lower estrogen levels, might be useful for the treatment of endometriosis pain.

AB  - Abstract
Myelination by oligodendrocytes is a highly specialized process that relies on intimate interactions between the axon and the oligodendrocytes. Astrocytes have an important part in facilitating myelination in the CNS, however, comparatively less is known about how they affect myelination. This review therefore summarizes the literature and explores lingering questions surrounding differences between white matter and gray matter astrocytes, how astrocytes support myelination, how their dysfunction in pathological states contributes to myelin pathologies and how astrocytes may facilitate remyelination. We discuss how astrocytes in the white matter are specialized to promote myelination and myelin maintenance by clearance of extracellular ions and neurotransmitters and by secretion of pro-myelinating factors. Additionally, astrocyte–oligodendrocyte coupling via gap junctions is crucial for both myelin formation and maintenance, due to K+ buffering and possibly metabolic support for oligodendrocytes via the panglial syncytium. Dysfunctional astrocytes aberrantly affect oligodendrocytes, as exemplified by a number of leukodystrophies in which astrocytic pathology is known as the direct cause of myelin pathology. Conversely, in primary demyelinating diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, astrocytes may facilitate remyelination. We suggest that specific manipulation of astrocytes could help prevent myelin pathologies and successfully restore myelin sheaths after demyelination.

AB  - Abstract
As the major excitatory neurotransmitter used in the vertebrate brain, glutamate activates ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), which mediate fast and slow neuronal actions, respectively. Important modulatory roles of mGluRs have been shown in many brain areas, and drugs targeting mGluRs have been developed for the treatment of brain disorders. Here, I review studies on mGluRs in the auditory system. Anatomical expression of mGluRs in the cochlear nucleus has been well characterized, while data for other auditory nuclei await more systematic investigations at both the light and electron microscopy levels. The physiology of mGluRs has been extensively studied using in vitro brain slice preparations, with a focus on the lower auditory brainstem in both mammals and birds. These in vitro physiological studies have revealed that mGluRs participate in neurotransmission, regulate ionic homeostasis, induce synaptic plasticity, and maintain the balance between excitation and inhibition in a variety of auditory structures. However, very few in vivo physiological studies on mGluRs in auditory processing have been undertaken at the systems level. Many questions regarding the essential roles of mGluRs in auditory processing still remain unanswered and more rigorous basic research is warranted.

AB  - Abstract
Previous neuroimaging studies of response inhibition have examined correlations between behavioral efficiency and brain activity, but the temporal stability of the correlations has largely been ignored. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study demonstrates the temporal changes of the brain activity associated with performance efficiency that led to more robust brain-behavior correlations in a later part of the experimental sessions. Participants performed a stop-signal task requiring inhibition of inappropriate responses, where more efficient behavioral performance is reflected in a shorter stop-signal reaction time (SSRT). Among across-subject negative correlations between the brain activity and the SSRT, the majority of the negative correlations were observed in the second half of experimental sessions. In the cerebellar region that showed the greatest difference in correlations between the second and the first halves, the brain activity increased in efficient performers, whereas the brain activity decreased in poor performers. These results suggest the existence of multiple brain mechanisms that increase and decrease the brain activity depending on the behavioral efficiency of the performers. More practically, these results indicate that robust brain-behavior correlations can more effectively be detected in a later part of the experimental sessions.

AB  - Abstract
Preterm infants are prematurely subjected to relatively high oxygen concentrations, even when supplemental oxygen is not administered. There is increasing evidence to show that an excess of oxygen is toxic to the developing brain. Dextromethorphan (DM), a frequently used antitussive agent with pleiotropic mechanisms of action, has been shown to be neuroprotective in various models of central nervous system pathology. Due to its numerous beneficial properties, it might also be able to counteract detrimental effects of a neonatal oxygen insult. The aim of the current study was to evaluate its therapeutic potential in established cell culture and rodent models of hyperoxia-induced neonatal brain injury.

For in vitro studies pre- and immature oligodendroglial (OLN-93) cells were subjected to hyperoxic conditions for 48 h after pre-treatment with increasing doses of DM. For in vivo studies 6-day-old Wistar rat pups received a single intraperitoneal injection of DM in two different dosages prior to being exposed to hyperoxia for 24 h. Cell viability and caspase-3 activation were assessed as outcome parameters at the end of exposure.

DM significantly increased cell viability in immature oligodendroglial cells subjected to hyperoxia. In pre-oligodendroglial cells cell viability was not significantly affected by DM treatment. In vivo caspase-3 activation induced by hyperoxic exposure was significantly lower after administration of DM in gray and white matter areas. In control animals kept under normoxic conditions DM did not significantly influence caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. The present results indicate that DM is a promising and safe treatment strategy for neonatal hyperoxia-induced brain injury that merits further investigation.

AB  - Abstract
Arousal enhances the readiness to process sensory information and respond to it. Rapid increment of arousal, referred to as arousal reaction or startle, increases the level of attention and the chance of survival. Arousal reaction is known to originate from the brainstem ascending reticular activating system and to modulate neuronal activity throughout the central nervous system. In the present study we investigated the effect of arousal on the central motor system by synchronizing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with acoustically evoked N100 potential. Because of the widespread cortical distribution of N100 to a sudden acoustic stimulus it is thought to be related to arousal reaction. Eight healthy subjects participated in this study. TMS was focused on the primary motor cortex utilizing neuronavigation. Trains of four identical loud tones repeated at 1-s intervals were delivered to the right ear and TMS was randomly placed after one tone in the train. The motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) were measured from the contralateral first dorsal interosseous muscle. The MEPs evoked by TMS timed at N100 after the first tone in train were significantly (p &lt; .001) larger in comparison with the control stimulation without a preceding sound or stimulation placed after the N100, i.e., 120% of the N100 interstimulus interval. Also, the MEPs following the second tone were significantly weaker (p &lt; .05) when compared with the MEPs following the first tone. Our findings suggest that acoustic arousal reaction facilitates, not only the activation of sensory cortices, but also simultaneously the central motor system.

AB  - Abstract
The neural pathways of the auditory system underlie our ability to detect sounds and to transform amplitude and frequency information into rich and meaningful perception. While it shares some organizational features with other sensory systems, the auditory system has some unique functions that impose special demands on precision in circuit assembly. In particular, the cochlear epithelium creates a frequency map rather than a space map, and specialized pathways extract information on interaural time and intensity differences to permit sound source localization. The assembly of auditory circuitry requires the coordinated function of multiple molecular cues. Eph receptors and their ephrin ligands constitute a large family of axon guidance molecules with developmentally regulated expression throughout the auditory system. Functional studies of Eph/ephrin signaling have revealed important roles at multiple levels of the auditory pathway, from the cochlea to the auditory cortex. These proteins provide graded cues used in establishing tonotopically ordered connections between auditory areas, as well as discrete cues that enable axons to form connections with appropriate postsynaptic partners within a target area. Throughout the auditory system, Eph proteins help to establish patterning in neural pathways during early development. This early targeting, which is further refined with neuronal activity, establishes the precision needed for auditory perception.

AB  - Abstract
In a previous study, we have shown that the small organic compound tegaserod, a drug approved for clinical application in an unrelated condition, is a mimic of the regeneration-beneficial glycan polysialic acid (PSA) in a mouse model of femoral nerve injury. Several independent observations have shown positive effects of PSA and its mimetic peptides in different paradigms of injury of the central and peripheral mammalian nervous systems. Since small organic compounds generally have advantages over metabolically rapidly degraded glycans and the proteolytically vulnerable mimetic peptides, a screen for a small PSA mimetic compound was successfully carried out, and the identified molecule proved to be beneficial in neurite outgrowth in vitro, independent of its originally described function as a 5-HT4 receptor agonist. In the present study, a mouse spinal cord compression device was used to elicit severe compression injury. We show that tegaserod promotes hindlimb motor function at 6 weeks after spinal cord injury compared to the control group receiving vehicle only. Immunohistology of the spinal cord rostral and caudal to the lesion site showed increased numbers of neurons, and a reduced area and intensity of glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity. Quantification of regrowth/sprouting of axons immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase and serotonin showed increased axonal density rostral and caudal to the injury site in the ventral horns of mice treated with tegaserod. The combined observations suggest that tegaserod has the potential for treatment of spinal cord injuries in higher vertebrates.

AB  - Abstract
Extracellular adenosine 5′-triphosphate (eATP) acts as a neurotransmitter within the retina and brain, activating a range of ionotropic P2X and metabotropic P2Y receptors. In this study, the specific localization of the P2X4 receptor (P2X4-R) subunit was evaluated in the retina using fluorescence immunohistochemistry and pre-embedding immuno-electron microscopy. Punctate P2X4-R labeling was largely localized to the inner and outer plexiform layers of mouse, rat and cat retinae. In the mouse outer retina, double-labeling of P2X4-R with the horizontal cell marker, calbindin, revealed P2X4-R immunoreactivity (P2X4-R-IR) on horizontal cell somata and processes. In the inner retina, P2X4-R expression was found closely associated with rod and cone bipolar cell terminals, and the punctate labeling was observed on calretinin-positive amacrine cells. Using immuno-electron microscopy, P2X4-Rs were observed on processes post-synaptic to photoreceptor and bipolar cell terminals, likely representing horizontal, amacrine and ganglion cells, respectively. Furthermore, P2X4-R expression was also observed on Müller cells, astrocytes and microglia. These data suggest a role for P2X4-Rs in the lateral inhibitory pathways of the retina, modulating neuronal function of photoreceptors and bipolar cells. The expression on macro- and microglial cells implicates a role for P2X4-Rs in glial signaling, tissue homeostasis and immunosurveillance within the mammalian retina.

AB  - Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as a major regulator in neurological diseases, and understanding their molecular mechanism in modulating cerebral ischemic injury may provide potential therapeutic targets for ischemic stroke. However, as one of 19 differentially expressed miRNAs in mouse brain with middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), the role of miR-134 in ischemic injury is not well understood. In this study, the miR-134 expression level was manipulated both in oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD)-treated N2A neuroblastoma cells in vitro and mouse brain with MCAO-induced ischemic stroke in vivo, and its possible targets of heat shock protein A5 (HSPA5) and HSPA12B were determined by bioinformatics analysis and dual luciferase assay. The results showed that overexpression of miR-134 exacerbated cell death and apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, downregulating miR-134 levels reduced cell death and apoptosis. Furthermore, non-expression of miR-134 enhanced HSPA12B protein levels in OGD-treated N2A cells as well as in the ischemic region. It could attenuate brain infarction size and neural cell damage, and improve neurological outcomes in mice with ischemic stroke, whereas upregulation of miR-134 had the opposite effect. In addition, HSPA12B was validated to be a target of miR-134 and its short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) could block miR-134 inhibitor-induced neuroprotection in OGD-treated N2A cells. In conclusion, downregulation of miR-134 could induce neuroprotection against ischemic injury in vitro and in vivo by negatively upregulating HSPA12B protein expression.

AB  - Abstract
Synaptic alterations in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are crucial for the aberrant reward-associated learning that forms the foundation of drug dependence. Altered glutamatergic synaptic plasticity, in particular, is thought to be a vital component of the neurobiological underpinnings of addictive behavior. The development of bacterial artificial chromosome-eGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) transgenic mice that express eGFP driven by endogenous D1 dopamine receptor (D1R) promoters has now allowed investigation of the cell type-specific synaptic modifications in the NAc in response to drugs of abuse. In this study, we used whole-cell ex vivo slice electrophysiology in Drd1-eGFP mice to investigate cell type-specific alterations in NAc synaptic plasticity following ethanol exposure. Electrophysiological recordings were made from eGFP-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1+ MSNs) and non-eGFP-expressing (putative D2 receptor-expressing) (D1− MSNs) from the shell subregion of the NAc. We observed low frequency-induced long-term depression (1 Hz-LTD) of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) solely in D1+ MSNs. However, 24 h following four consecutive days of in vivo chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor exposure, 1-Hz LTD was conversely observed only in D1− MSNs, and now absent in D1+ MSNs. Complete recovery of the baseline plasticity phenotype in both cell types required a full 2 weeks of withdrawal from CIE vapor exposure. Thus, we observed a cell type specificity of synaptic plasticity in the NAc shell, as well as, a gradual recovery of the pre-ethanol exposure plasticity state following extended withdrawal. These changes highlight the adaptability of NAc shell MSNs to the effects of ethanol exposure and may represent critical neuroadaptations underlying the development of ethanol dependence.

AB  - Abstract
Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is a neuropeptide that plays neuroprotective roles in cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury in animal models or oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in cultured neurons. Recent data suggest that intranasal CART treatment facilitates neuroregeneration in stroke brain. However, little is known about the effects of post-treatment with CART during the neuronal recovery after OGD and reoxygenation in cultured primary cortical neurons. The present study was to investigate the role of CART treated after OGD injury in neurons. Primary mouse cortical neurons were subjected to OGD and then treated with CART. Our data show that post-treatment with CART reduced the neuronal apoptosis caused by OGD injury. In addition, CART repaired OGD-impaired cortical neurons by increasing the expression of growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), which promotes neurite outgrowth. This effect depends on pleiotrophin (PTN) as siRNA-mediated PTN knockdown totally abolished the increase in CART-stimulated GAP43 protein levels. In summary, our findings demonstrate that CART repairs the neuronal injury after OGD by facilitating neurite outgrowth through PTN-dependent pathway. The role for CART in neurite outgrowth makes it a new potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Abstract
Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB) is a type I transmembrane protein reported to have neuroprotective effects in the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We investigated whether GPNMB is also neuroprotective against brain ischemia–reperfusion injury (IRI). Focal ischemia/reperfusion injury was induced via filament middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 2 h, followed by reperfusion upon withdrawal of the filament. We assessed the neuroprotective effects of GPNMB using transgenic (Tg) mice which over expressing GPNMB or recombinant GPNMB which has the sequence of human extracellular GPNMB. The results showed that GPNMB was up-regulated after IRI, and that genomic over-expression of GPNMB significantly ameliorated infarct volume. Next, we investigated the protective mechanisms of GPNMB via Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), and protein kinase B (Akt), were increased in the GPNMB Tg group according to Western blotting data. IHC analysis showed that GPNMB was expressed not only in neurons, but also in astrocytes, produced labeling patterns similar to that in human brain ischemia. Furthermore, recombinant GPNMB also decreased infarction volume. These results indicate that GPNMB protected neurons against IRI, and phosphor-Akt and phosphor-ERK might be a part of the protective mechanisms, and that the neuroprotective effect of GPNMB was seemingly induced by the extracellular sequence of GPNMB.

In conclusion, these findings indicate that GPNMB has neuroprotective effects against IRI, via phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt, suggesting that GPNMB may be a therapeutic target for ischemia–reperfusion injuries.

Brain injuries such as focal stroke initiate a myriad of neural events leading to local and remote alterations in cerebral networks. The neurochemical and neurophysiological mechanisms underlying these postlesion changes raise the question of their beneficial or adverse effects on functional recovery. In this review, we aim to reconcile findings from animal and patients studies using a “from cellular-to network-levels” perspective to gain further insights into the neuroplasticity mechanisms underlying recovery of sensorimotor functions. Ultimately, an integrative view of the multiple facets of poststroke changes should give an impetus to novel neurorehabilitation strategies by providing evidence of how neuroscience findings can be translated and operationalized within the context of restorative stroke.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic sleep restriction (CSR) has various negative consequences on cognitive performance and health. Using a rat model of CSR that uses alternating cycles of 3 h of sleep deprivation (using slowly rotating activity wheels) and 1 h of sleep opportunity continuously for 4 days (‘3/1’ protocol), we previously observed not only homeostatic but also allostatic (adaptive) sleep responses to CSR. In particular, non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) electroencephalogram (EEG) delta power, an index of sleep intensity, increased initially and then declined gradually during CSR, with no rebound during a 2-day recovery period. To study underlying mechanisms of these allostatic responses, we examined the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is known to regulate NREMS EEG delta activity, during the same CSR protocol. Mature BDNF protein levels were measured in the frontal cortex and basal forebrain, two brain regions involved in sleep and EEG regulation, and the hippocampus, using Western blot analysis. Adult male Wistar rats were housed in motorized activity wheels, and underwent the 3/1 CSR protocol for 27 h, for 99 h, or for 99 h followed by 24 h of recovery. Additional rats were housed in either locked wheels (locked wheel controls [LWCs]) or unlocked wheels that rats could rotate freely (wheel-running controls [WRCs]). BDNF levels did not differ between WRC and LWC groups. BDNF levels were increased, compared to the control levels, in all three brain regions after 27 h, and were increased less strongly after 99 h, of CSR. After 24 h of recovery, BDNF levels were at the control levels. This time course of BDNF levels parallels the previously reported changes in NREMS delta power during the same CSR protocol. Changes in BDNF protein levels in the cortex and basal forebrain may be part of the molecular mechanisms underlying allostatic sleep responses to CSR.

AB  - Abstract
Hemokinin-1 (HK-1) is a new mammalian tachykinin peptide consisting of the amino acid sequence similar to substance P (SP). Although the function of SP, a representative tachykinin peptide, has been well established in the pain system, that of HK-1 has not yet been elucidated. [Leu11]-SP had an antagonistic effect on SP-induced scratching behavior, suggesting that [Leu11]-HK-1 may also attenuate the induction of scratching behavior by HK-1. Thus, the effects of a pretreatment with [Leu11]-HK-1 were evaluated to clarify the function of HK-1. The intrathecal administration of [Leu11]-HK-1 attenuated the induction of scratching by HK-1, but not SP, while [Leu11]-SP reduced the induction of scratching by SP, but not HK-1. These results indicated that [Leu11]-HK-1 may be a more specific antagonist of HK-1-preferred receptors and [Leu11]-SP has an antagonistic effect on the SP-preferred receptor, the neurokinin 1 receptor. In the formalin test for examining noxious response, the intrathecal administration of [Leu11]-SP, but not [Leu11]-HK-1, reduced the number of flinchings and c-Fos-positive cells in the spinal dorsal horn following formalin injection into the plantar region of the hind paw. These results indicated that SP, but not HK-1, is involved in nociceptive processing at the spinal level. To evaluate the involvement of HK-1 and SP in pruritic processing, the effect of [Leu11]-HK-1 and [Leu11]-SP on the induction of scratching behavior and c-Fos expression by serotonin (5-HT) and histamine was evaluated. The increased induction of scratching behavior and c-Fos expression by 5-HT and histamine was markedly attenuated by pretreatment with both [Leu11]-HK-1 and [Leu11]-SP, suggesting that HK-1 and SP may be involved in pruritic processing. These results indicate that HK-1 is involved in pruritic processing and [Leu11]-HK-1 is a valuable tool for clarifying the mechanisms underlying pruritic processing.

AB  - Abstract
Tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is highly expressed in neurons and PTEN inhibition has been reported to be neuroprotective against ischemic stroke in experimental models. On the other hand, PTEN deletion has been shown to lead to cognitive impairment. In the current study, we examined the expression and functions of PTEN in an ischemic stroke rodent model. We found rapid S-nitrosylation and degradation of PTEN after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. PTEN degradation leads to activation of Akt. PTEN partial deletion or PTEN inhibition increased the expression of GABAA receptor (GABAAR) γ2 subunit and enhanced GABAA receptor current. After cerebral ischemia, increased expression of GABAAR γ2 subunit was observed in the ischemia region and the penumbra area. We also observed PTEN loss in astrocytes after cerebral ischemia. Astrocytic PTEN partial knockout increased astrocyte activation and exacerbated ischemic damage. We speculated that ischemic stroke induced neuronal PTEN degradation, hence enhanced GABAA receptor-medicated neuronal activity inhibition which could attenuate excitotoxicity and provide neuroprotection during the acute phase after stroke, while inhibiting long-term functional recovery and contributing to vascular cognitive impairment after stroke. On the other hand, ischemic stroke induced astrocytic PTEN loss and enhanced ischemic damage and astrogliosis. Taken together, our study indicates that ischemic stroke induces rapid PTEN degradation in both neurons and astrocytes which play both protective and detrimental action in a spatiotemporal- and cell-type-dependent manner. Our study provides critical insight for targeting PTEN signaling pathway for stroke treatment.

AB  - Abstract
This review discusses the impact of neurotrophins and other trophic factors, including fibroblast growth factor and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, on mood disorders, weight regulation and drug abuse, with an emphasis on stress- and drug-induced changes in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Neurotrophins, comprising nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophins 3 and 4/5 play important roles in neuronal plasticity and the development of different psychopathologies. In the VTA, most research has focused on the role of BDNF, because other neurotrophins are not found there in significant quantities. BDNF originating in the VTA provides trophic support to dopamine neurons. The diverse intracellular signaling pathways activated by BDNF may underlie precise physiological functions specific to the VTA. In general, VTA BDNF expression increases after psychostimulant exposures, and enhanced BDNF level in the VTA facilitates psychostimulant effects. The impact of VTA BDNF on the behavioral effects of psychostimulants relies primarily on its action within the mesocorticolimbic circuit. In the case of opiates, VTA BDNF expression and effects seem to be dependent on whether an animal is drug-naïve or has a history of drug use, only the latter of which is related to dopamine mechanisms. Social defeat stress that is continuous in mice or intermittent in rats increases VTA BDNF expression, and is associated with depressive and social avoidance behaviors. Intermittent social defeat stress induces persistent VTA BDNF expression that triggers psychostimulant cross-sensitization. Understanding the cellular and molecular substrates of neurotrophin effects may lead to novel therapeutic approaches for the prevention and treatment of substance use and mood disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Trimethyltin chloride (TMT) is a neurotoxicant producing neuronal degeneration and reactive astrogliosis in the mammalian central nervous system, especially the hippocampus. A previous magnetic resonance imaging investigation in TMT-treated rats evidenced dilation of lateral ventricles, also suggesting alterations in blood–brain barrier permeability and brain edema.

Aquaporin 4 (AQP4), a glial water channel protein expressed mainly in the nervous system, is considered a specific marker of vascular permeability and thought to play an important role in brain edema (conditions). We studied AQP4 expression in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of TMT-treated rats in order to explore the molecular mechanisms involved in brain edema occurring in these experimental conditions.

Real-time PCR and western blotting data showed significant up-regulation of both AQP4 mRNA and protein levels starting 14 days after TMT treatment in the hippocampus and cortex. Parallel immunofluorescence studies indicated intense astrogliosis and AQP4 immunoreactivity diffusely pronounced in the hippocampal and cortex areas starting 14 days after TMT intoxication. In order to study the effects of TMT on vascular integrity, double-label immunofluorescence experiments for rat immunoglobulin G (IgG) and rat endothelial cell antigen-1 (RECA-1) or neuronal nuclei (NeuN) (endothelial and neuronal markers respectively) were performed. The results indicated, at 21 and 35 days after treatment, the presence of rat IgG in paravasal parenchyma and in some neuronal cells of the hippocampus and cortex. The extravasated IgG staining was temporally correlated with over-expression of neuronal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the active phosphorylated form of its neuronal receptor (VEGFR-2P), suggesting that these factors may cooperate in mediating vascular leakage.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic exposure to stress hormones has an impact on brain structures relevant to cognition. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) are involved in numerous cognitive processes including learning and memory formation. In order to better understand the molecular mechanisms of chronic stress-triggered mental disease, the effect of corticosterone (CORT) on the biology of AChRs was studied in the neuronal cell line CNh. We found that chronic treatment with CORT reduced the expression levels of the α7-type neuronal AChR and, to a lesser extent, of α4-AChR. CORT also delayed the acquisition of the mature cell phenotype in CNh cells. Chronic nicotine treatment affected the differentiation of CNh cells and exerted a synergistic effect with CORT, suggesting that AChR could participate in signaling pathways that control the cell cycle. Overexpression of α7-AChR-GFP abolished the CORT effects on the cell cycle and the specific α7-AChR inhibitor, methyllycaconitine, mimicked the proliferative action exerted by CORT. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings showed a significant decrease in nicotine-evoked currents in CORT-treated cells. Taken together, these observations indicate that AChRs, and the α7-AChR in particular, could act as modulators of the differentiation of CNh cells and that CORT could impair the acquisition of a mature phenotype by affecting the function of this AChR subtype.

AB  - Abstract
Physical exercise could play a neuroprotective role in both human and animals. However, the involved signal pathways underlying the neuroprotective effect are still not well established. This study was to investigate the possible signal pathways involved in the neuroprotection of pre-ischemic treadmill training after ischemic stroke. Seventy-two SD rats were randomly assigned into three groups (n = 24/group): sham surgery group, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group and MCAO with exercise group. Following three weeks of treadmill training exercise, ischemic stroke was induced by occluding the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in rat for 2 h, followed by reperfusion. Twenty-four hours after MCAO/reperfusion, 12 rats in each group were evaluated for neurological deficit scores and then sacrificed to measure the infarct volume (n = 6) and cerebral edema (n = 6). Six rats in each group were sacrificed to measure the expression level of glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1), protein kinase C-α (PKC-α), Akt, and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) (n = 6). Two hundred and eighty minutes (4.67 h) after occlusion, six rats in each group were decapitated to detect the mRNA expression level of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit type 2B (NR2B) (n = 6).The results demonstrated that pre-ischemic treadmill training exercise reduced brain infarct volume, cerebral edema and neurological deficits, also decreased the over expression of PKC-α and increased the expression level of GLT-1, Akt and PI3K after ischemic stroke (p &lt; 0.05). The over-expression of mGluR5 and NR2B mRNA was also inhibited by pre-ischemic exercise (p &lt; 0.05). In summary, exercise preconditioning ameliorated brain damage after ischemic stroke, which might be involved in two signal pathways: PKC-α–GLT-1–Glutamate and PI3K/Akt–GLT-1–Glutamate.

AB  - Abstract
Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element that is required for normal brain functioning. However, excessive intake of Mn has been known to lead to neuronal loss and clinical symptoms resembling idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD), whose precise molecular mechanism remains largely elusive. In the study, we established a Mn-exposed rat model and identified a mitochondrial protease, the mature form of high temperature requirement A2 (HtrA2/Omi), which was significantly upregulated in rat brain striatum after Mn exposure. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the expression of mature HtrA2 was remarkably increased following Mn exposure. In addition, immunofluorescence assay demonstrated that overexposure to Mn could lead to significant elevation in the number of HtrA2-positive neurons. Accordingly, the expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), a well-characterized target of HtrA2-mediated proteolysis, was progressively decreased following Mn exposure, and was correlated with increased level of active caspase-3. Further, we showed that Mn exposure decreased the viability and induced apparent apoptosis of NFG-differentiated PC12 cells. Importantly, the expression of HtrA2 was progressively increased, whereas the level of cellular XIAP was reduced during Mn-induced apoptosis. In addition, blockage of HtrA2 activity with UCF-101 restored Mn-induced reduction in XIAP expression. Finally, we observed that UCF-101 treatment ameliorated Mn-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells. Collectively, these findings suggested that upregulated HtrA2 played a role in Mn-induced neuronal death in brain striatum.

5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is abundant in the brain, suggesting an important role in epigenetic control of neuronal functions. In this paper, we show that 5hmC and 5-methylcytosine (5mC) levels are coordinately distributed in gene promoters of the rhesus macaque prefrontal cortex. Although promoter hydroxymethylation and methylation are overall negatively correlated with expression, a subset of highly expressed genes involved in specific cerebral functions is associated with high levels of 5mC and 5hmC. These relationships were also observed in the mouse cortex. Furthermore, we found that early-life maternal deprivation is associated, in the adult monkey cortex, with DNA hydroxymethylation changes of promoters of genes related to neurological functions and psychological disorders. These results reveal that early social adversity triggers variations in brain DNA hydroxymethylation that could be detected in adulthood.

AB  - Abstract
Abnormalities of mental status represent a severe complication and an important cause of death in acute pancreatitis (AP), which is characterized by a pattern of neurological signs and symptoms. As some of the symptoms of AP are also affected by catecholamine neurotransmitters, they cannot be ruled out of the pathophysiology of AP; however, little research has been performed exploring this hypothesis. Our study aimed to elucidate whether AP affects the metabolism of catecholamine neurotransmitters in rats.

A total of 300 male SD rats were randomly divided into five groups: control, 6H, 24H, 48H and 72H experimental groups. AP was induced in rats by an injection of a sodium taurocholate solution via a cannulated bile-pancreatic duct. In the striatum, hippocampus and cerebellum, catecholamine neurotransmitters were tested using high performance liquid chromatography equipped with a electrochemical detector, and the activities and protein concentration levels of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) were also evaluated using ELISA and Western blotting analyses.

In the hippocampus, the dopamine (DA) concentrations increased in the 48-h and 72-h groups. The 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) concentration of the 72-h group also increased. The MAO-A and TH activity of the 6-h and 24-h groups decreased, respectively. The TH activities of the 48-h groups also decreased. The MAO-A and TH protein concentration of the 6-h and 24-h groups decreased. In the corpus striatum, the homovanillic acid concentration of the 72-h group and norepinephrine concentrations of the 24-h and 48-h groups increased, respectively. The MAO-A and TH activities of the 6-h and 24-h groups decreased. The MAO-A and TH protein concentrations of the 6-h and 24-h groups decreased. In the prefrontal cortex (left prefrontal lobe), the DA and DOPAC concentrations of the 48-h group increased. The MAO-A and TH activities of the 6-h, 24-h and 48-h groups decreased. The MAO-A and TH protein concentrations of the 6-h and 24-h groups also decreased. The other catecholamine concentration and enzyme activities fluctuated, but there was no statistically significant difference compared with the control group.

Catecholamine neurotransmitter metabolic systems are widely affected in AP, and these fluctuations may play an important role in determining the symptomatology of AP.

AB  - Abstract
Auditory information plays an important role in fine motor control such as speech and musical performance. The purpose of this study was to assess expertise-dependent differences in the role of temporal information of auditory feedback in the production of sequential movements. Differences in motor responses to the transient delay of tone production during musical performance between expert pianists and non-musicians were evaluated. Compared to expert pianists, non-musicians showed more pronounced movement disruptions following the delayed auditory feedback. For example, in response to a perturbation the inter-keystroke interval was prolonged and the key-press was longer in non-musicians, while the expert pianist marginally shortened both measures. These distinct differences between groups suggest that extensive musical training influences feedback control in sequential finger movements. Furthermore, there was a significant positive correlation between the age at which the expert pianists commenced their musical training and the amount of disruption. Overall, these findings suggest that expert pianists have a higher level of robustness against perturbations and depend less on auditory feedback during the performance of sequential movements.

AB  - Abstract
Environmental enrichment can modulate mild and chronic stress, responses to anxiogenic stimuli as well as drug vulnerability in a number of animal models. The current study was designed to examine the impact of postnatal environmental enrichment on selectively bred 4th generation high- (HAn) and low-anxiety (LAn) male rats. After weaning, animals were placed in isolated (IE), social (SE) and enriched environments (EE) (e.g., toys, wheels, ropes, changed weekly). We measured anxiety-like behavior (ALB) on the elevated plus maze (EPM; trial 1 at postnatal day (PND) 46, trial 2 at PND 63), amphetamine (AMPH) (0.5 mg/kg, IP)-induced locomotor behavior, basal and post anxiogenic stimuli changes in (1) plasma corticosterone, (2) blood pressure and (3) core body temperature. Initially, animals showed consistent trait differences on EPM with HAn showing more ALB but after 40 days in select housing, HAn rats reared in an EE showed less ALB and diminished AMPH-induced activity compared to HAn animals housed in IE and SE. In the physiological tests, animals housed in EE showed elevated adrenocortical responses to forced novel object exposure but decreased body temperature and blood pressure changes after an air puff stressor. All animals reared in EE and SE had elevated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-positive cells in the central amygdala (CeA), CA1 and CA2 hippocampal regions and the caudate putamen, but these differences were most pronounced in HAn rats for CeA, CA1 and CA2. Overall, these findings suggest that environmental enrichment offers benefits for trait anxiety rats including a reduction in behavioral and physiological responses to anxiogenic stimuli and AMPH sensitivity, and these responses correlate with changes in BDNF expression in the central amygdala, hippocampus and the caudate putamen.

AB  - Abstract
Proper development of the auditory cortex depends on early acoustic experience that modulates the balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) circuits. In the present social and occupational environment exposure to chronic loud sound in the form of occupational or recreational noise, is becoming inevitable. This could especially disrupt the functional auditory cortex development leading to altered processing of complex sound and hearing impairment. Here we report the effects of prenatal chronic loud sound (110-dB sound pressure level (SPL)) exposure (rhythmic [music] and arrhythmic [noise] forms) on the molecular components involved in regulation of the E/I balance in the developing auditory cortex analog/Field L (AuL) in domestic chicks. Noise exposure at 110-dB SPL significantly enhanced the E/I ratio (increased expression of AMPA receptor GluR2 subunit and glutamate with decreased expression of GABA(A) receptor gamma 2 subunit and GABA), whereas loud music exposure maintained the E/I ratio. Expressions of markers of synaptogenesis, synaptic stability and plasticity i.e., synaptophysin, PSD-95 and gephyrin were reduced with noise but increased with music exposure. Thus our results showed differential effects of prenatal chronic loud noise and music exposures on the E/I balance and synaptic function and stability in the developing auditory cortex. Loud music exposure showed an overall enrichment effect whereas loud noise-induced significant alterations in E/I balance could later impact the auditory function and associated cognitive behavior.

AB  - Abstract
Increased reactive oxygen species generation and mitochondrial dysfunction occur during ethanol hangover. The aim of this work was to study the effect of melatonin pretreatment on motor performance and mitochondrial function during ethanol hangover. Male mice received melatonin solution or its vehicle in drinking water during 7 days and i.p. injection with EtOH (3.8 g/kg BW) or saline at the eighth day. Motor performance and mitochondrial function were evaluated at the onset of hangover (6 h after injection). Melatonin improved motor coordination in ethanol hangover mice. Malate–glutamate-dependent oxygen uptake was decreased by ethanol hangover treatment and partially prevented by melatonin pretreatment. Melatonin alone induced a decrease of 30% in state 4 succinate-dependent respiratory rate. Also, the activity of the respiratory complexes was decreased in melatonin-pretreated ethanol hangover group. Melatonin pretreatment before the hangover prevented mitochondrial membrane potential collapse and induced a 79% decrement of hydrogen peroxide production as compared with ethanol hangover group. Ethanol hangover induced a 25% decrease in NO production. Melatonin alone and as a pretreatment before ethanol hangover significantly increased NO production by nNOS and iNOS as compared with control groups. No differences were observed in nNOS protein expression, while iNOS expression was increased in the melatonin group. Increased NO production by melatonin could be involved in the decrease of succinate-dependent oxygen consumption and the inhibition of complex IV observed in our study. Melatonin seems to act as an antioxidant agent in the ethanol hangover condition but also exhibited some dual effects related to NO metabolism.

AB  - Abstract
Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC) are glial cells that metamorphose into myelinating oligodendrocytes during embryogenesis and early stages of post-natal life. OPCs continue to divide throughout adulthood and some eventually differentiate into oligodendrocytes in response to demyelinating lesions. There is growing evidence that OPCs are also involved in activity-driven de novo myelination of previously unmyelinated axons and myelin remodeling in adulthood. In this review, we summarize the interwoven factors and cascades that promote the activation, recruitment and differentiation of OPCs into myelinating oligodendrocytes in the adult brain based mostly on results found in the study of demyelinating diseases. The goal of the review was to draw a complete picture of the transformation of OPCs into mature oligodendrocytes to facilitate the study of this transformation in both the normal and diseased adult brain.

AB  - Abstract
We tested the hypothesis that the angiotensinergic neurotransmission, specifically in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), is involved in the cardiovascular modulation during acute restraint stress (RS) in rats. The intravenous pretreatment with the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist losartan (5 mg/kg) inhibited the pressor response to RS, but did not affect the concomitant RS-evoked tachycardiac response. Because similar effects were observed after the PVN pretreatment with CoCl2, and considering the high density of angiotensin receptors reported in the PVN, we studied the effect of the pretreatment of the PVN with either losartan or the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril on the RS-evoked cardiovascular response. The bilateral microinjection of losartan (0.5 nmol/100 nL) or lisinopril (0.5 nmol/100 nL) into the PVN inhibited the RS-related pressor response without affecting the tachycardiac response, suggesting that the PVN angiotensinergic neurotransmission modulates the vascular component of the stress response. Finally, to exclude the possibility that centrally injected drugs could be leaking to the circulation and acting on peripheral vascular receptors, we tested the effect of the intravenous pretreatment with either losartan (0.5 nmol/animal) or lisinopril (0.5 nmol/animal), assuming the hypothesis of a total spread of drugs from the CNS to the peripheral circulation. When animals were pretreated with such doses of either losartan or lisinopril, the cardiovascular RS-evoked response was not affected, thus indicating that even if there were a complete leakage of the drug to the periphery, it would not affect the cardiovascular response to RS. This observation favors the idea that the effect of the intravenous injection of 5 mg/kg of losartan on the RS-related cardiovascular response would be explained by an action across the blood–brain barrier, possibly in the PVN. In conclusion, the results suggest that an angiotensinergic neurotransmission in the PVN acting on AT1-receptors modulates the vascular component of the RS-evoked cardiovascular response.

AB  - Abstract
Leucine-rich repeat in Flightless-1 interaction protein 1 (Lrrfip1) is an up-regulated protein after cerebral ischemia whose precise role in the brain both in healthy and ischemic conditions is unclear. Different Lrrfip1 isoforms with distinct roles have been reported in human and mouse species. The present study aimed to analyze the Lrrfip1 transcriptional variants expressed in rat cortex, to characterize their expression patterns and subcellular location after ischemia, and to define their putative role in the brain. Five transcripts were identified and three of them (Lrrfip1, CRA_g and CRA_a′ (Fli-I leucine-rich repeat associated protein 1 – Flap-1)) were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). All the transcripts were up-regulated and showed differential expression patterns after in vivo and in vitro ischemia models. The main isoform, Lrrfip1, was found to be up-regulated from the acute to the late phases of ischemia in the cytoplasm of neurons and astrocytes of the peri-infarct area. This study demonstrates that Lrrfip1 activates β-catenin, Akt, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) proteins in astrocytes and positively regulates the expression of the excitatory amino acid transporter subtype 2 (GLT-1). Our findings point to Lrrfip1 as a key brain protein that regulates pro-survival pathways and proteins and encourages further studies to elucidate its role in cerebral ischemia as a potential target to prevent brain damage and promote functional recovery after stroke.

AB  - Abstract
Ca2+ binding protein 1 (CaBP1) and caldendrin are alternatively spliced variants of a subfamily of CaBPs with high homology to calmodulin. Although CaBP1 and caldendrin regulate effectors including plasma membrane and intracellular Ca2+ channels in heterologous expression systems, little is known about their functions in vivo. Therefore, we generated mice deficient in CaBP1/caldendrin expression (C-KO) and analyzed the expression and cellular localization of CaBP1 and caldendrin in the mouse brain. Immunoperoxidase labeling with antibodies recognizing both CaBP1 and caldendrin was absent in the brain of C-KO mice, but was intense in multiple brain regions of wild-type mice. By Western blot, the antibodies detected two proteins that were absent in the C-KO mouse and consistent in size with caldendrin variants originating from alternative translation initiation sites. By quantitative PCR, caldendrin transcript levels were far greater than those for CaBP1, particularly in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. In the frontal cortex but not in the hippocampus, caldendrin expression increased steadily from birth. By double-label immunofluorescence, CaBP1/caldendrin was localized in principal neurons and parvalbumin-positive interneurons. In the cerebellum, CaBP1/caldendrin antibodies labeled interneurons in the molecular layer and in basket cell terminals surrounding the soma and axon initial segment of Purkinje neurons, but immunolabeling was absent in Purkinje neurons. We conclude that CaBP1/caldendrin is localized both pre- and postsynaptically where it may regulate Ca2+ signaling and excitability in select groups of excitatory and inhibitory neurons.

AB  - Abstract
Early brain injury (EBI) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is characterized by a reduction in excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) expression and severe amino acid excitotoxicity. The aim of this study was to explore the neuroprotective effect of ceftriaxone (CEF), a potent compound that up-regulates EAAT2, against EBI and the potential mechanisms using in vitro experiments and a rat model of SAH. Intracisternal treatment with CEF significantly improved neurological outcomes and alleviated extracellular glutamate accumulation after SAH. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay (TUNEL) staining and Western blot analysis of cleaved caspase 3 showed that CEF decreased hippocampal neuronal apoptosis following SAH. Immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting revealed that CEF significantly reversed the down-regulation of EAAT2 expression following SAH. In Morris water maze (MWM) tests, CEF remarkably ameliorated the SAH-induced cognitive dysfunction in spatial learning memory and reference memory. CEF promoted the nuclear translocation of p65 as well as the activation of Akt in hippocampal astrocytes in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that CEF may exert significant protective effects against EBI following SAH by modulating the PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway.

AB  - Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive brain disorder that causes gradual and irreversible loss of higher brain functions and is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, as assessed by autopsy and clinical series. Furthermore, it has an annual incidence of approximately 3% in the 65–74-year-old age group. This incidence rate doubles with every increment of 5 years above the age of 65. In Morocco, AD affects almost 30,000 individuals and this number will possibly increase to 75,000 by 2020 (projections of the World Health Organization (WHO)). Genetically, AD is caused by a mutation in one of at least 3 genes: presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Most cases are late onset and apparently sporadic, most likely as a result of a combination of environmental and non-dominant genetic factors. In Morocco, the genes predisposing individuals to AD and predicting disease incidence remain elusive. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the genetic contribution of mutations in PS1 and PS2 genes to familial early-onset AD cases and sporadic late-onset AD cases. Seventeen sporadic late-onset AD cases and eight familial early-onset AD cases were seen at the memory clinic of the University of Casablanca Neurology Department. These patients underwent standard somatic neurological examination, cognitive function assessment, brain imaging and laboratory tests. Direct sequencing of each exon in PS1 and PS2 genes was performed on genomic DNA of AD patients. Further, we identified 1 novel frameshift mutation in the PS1 gene and 2 novel frameshift mutations in the PS2 gene. Our mutational analysis reports a correlation between clinical symptoms and genetic factors in our cases of Early-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease (EOAD). These putative mutations cosegregate with affected family members suggesting a direct mutagenic effect.

GABAergic neurons are known to inhibit neural transduction and therefore negatively affect excitatory neural circuits in the brain. We have previously reported that 5-(3-methoxyphenyl)-3-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-1,6-naphthyridin-2(1H)-one (AC-3933), a partial inverse agonist for the benzodiazepine receptor (BzR), reverses GABAergic inhibitory effect on cholinergic neurons, and thus enhances acetylcholine release from these neurons in rat hippocampal slices. In this study, we evaluated AC-3933 potential for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, a disorder characterized by progressive decline mainly in cholinergic function. Oral administration of AC-3933 (0.01–0.03 mg/kg) resulted in the amelioration of scopolamine-induced amnesia, as well as a shift in electroencephalogram (EEG) relative power characteristic of pro-cognitive cholinergic activators, such as donepezil. In addition, treatment with AC-3933 even at the high dose of 100 mg/kg p.o. produced no seizure or anxiety, two major adverse effects of BzR inverse agonists developed in the past. These findings indicate that AC-3933 with its low risk for side effects may be useful in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.

AB  - Abstract
Interactions between the prelimbic cortex and the basolateral amygdala underlie fear memory processing, mostly through acquiring and consolidating the learning of a conditioned fear. More recently, studies highlighted the role of the dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG) in the modulation of learning fear responses. In addition, extensive data in the literature have signaled the importance of serotonin (5-HT) on fear and anxiety. In the present study, the role of 5-HT neurotransmission of the prelimbic cortex, basolateral amygdala or the DPAG on the unconditioned and conditioned fear responses in rats previously selected as low- (LA) or high-anxious (HA) were assessed through local infusions of 5-HT itself (10 nmol/0.2 μl) or the selective 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT – 0.3 μg/0.2 μl). Behavioral analysis was conducted using the fear-potentiated startle (FPS) procedure. Dependent variables recorded were the latency and amplitude of the unconditioned startle response and FPS. Our findings suggest that, on the prelimbic cortex, 5-HT modulates the expression of conditioned fear response in HA rats and this modulation is dependent on 5-HT1A receptors. This is not true, however, for the basolateral amygdala or the DPAG. In these regions LA but not HA rats were susceptible to the anxiolytic-like effect of 5-HT1A receptor activation. It is thought that the expression of conditioned fear in HA subjects may be dependent on other 5-HT receptors, as the 5-HT1B subtype, and/or changes in other systems such as the GABA and glutamate neurotransmitters. These results increase our understanding of the rostrocaudal influence of 5-HT on the unconditioned and conditioned fear responses in LA and HA subjects and, to some extent, are in disagreement with the theoretical current that emphasizes the role of 5-HT on anxiety, mainly at the subcortical and midbrain levels.

AB  - Abstract
The distribution and functional presence of three voltage-dependent potassium channels, Kv2.1, Kv3.4, Kv4.3, respectively, were studied in the central nervous system of the snail Helix pomatia by immunohistochemical and electrophysiological methods. Cell clusters displaying immunoreactivity for the different channels were observed in all parts of the CNS, although their localization and number partly varied. Differences were also found in their intracellular, perikaryonal and axonal localization, as well as in their presence in non-neuronal tissues nearby the CNS, such as the perineurium and the aorta wall. At ultrastructural level Kv4.3 channel immunolabeling was observed in axon profiles containing large 80–100 nm granular vesicles. Blotting analyses revealed specific signals for the Kv2.1, Kv3.4 and Kv4.3 channels, confirming the presence of the channels in the Helix CNS. Voltage-clamp recordings proved that outward currents obtained from neurons displaying Kv3.4 or Kv4.3 immunoreactivity contained transient components while Kv2.1 immunoreactive cells were characterized by delayed currents. The distribution of the K+-channels containing neurons suggests specific roles in intercellular signaling processes in the Helix CNS, most probably related to well-defined, partly local events. The cellular localization of the K+-channels studied supports their involvement in both pre- and postsynaptic events at perikaryonal and axonal levels.

AB  - Abstract
The pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) of the ventrolateral medulla is the kernel for inspiratory rhythm generation. However, it is not fully understood how inspiratory neural activity is generated in the preBötC and propagates to other medullary regions. We analyzed the detailed anatomical connectivity to and from the preBötC and functional aspects of the inspiratory information propagation from the preBötC on the transverse plane of the medulla oblongata. Tract-tracing with immunohistochemistry in young adult rats demonstrated that neurokinin-1 receptor- and somatostatin-immunoreactive neurons in the preBötC, which could be involved in respiratory rhythmogenesis, are embedded in the plexus of axons originating in the contralateral preBötC. By voltage-imaging in rhythmically active slices of neonatal rats, we analyzed origination and propagation of inspiratory neural activity as depolarizing wave dynamics on the entire transverse plane as well as within the preBötC. Novel combination of pharmacological blockade of glutamatergic transmission and mathematical subtraction of the video images under blockade from the control images enabled to extract glutamatergic signal propagations. By ultra-high-speed voltage-imaging we first demonstrated the inter-preBötC conduction process of inspiratory action potentials. Intra-preBötC imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution during a single spontaneous inspiratory cycle unveiled deterministic nonlinearities, i.e., chaos, in the population recruitment. Collectively, we comprehensively elucidated the anatomical pathways to and from the preBötC and dynamics of inspiratory neural information propagation: (1) From the preBötC in one side to the contralateral preBötC, which would synchronize the bilateral rhythmogenic kernels, (2) from the preBötC directly to the bilateral hypoglossal premotor and motor areas as well as to the nuclei tractus solitarius, and (3) from the hypoglossal premotor areas toward the hypoglossal motor nuclei. The coincidence of identified anatomical and functional connectivity between the preBötC and other regions in adult and neonatal rats, respectively, indicates that this fundamental connectivity is already well developed at the time of birth.

AB  - Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) usually leads to severe sensory and motor deficits below the spinal lesion. Previous animal models have shown significant atrophic changes in the neural sensorimotor system following SCI. However, specific anatomical changes in the human brain following SCI remain poorly understood. The purpose of the present study was to investigate structural changes during the early stage of SCI, and to investigate further the association between the structural changes and patients’ sensorimotor functions. The study participants included 20 patients with SCI and 30 matched healthy controls. The mean period post-SCI was 8.9 ± 2.7 weeks (range 4–12 weeks). Voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate the regions with gray and white matter volume changes. Compared to healthy controls, patients with SCI showed significant gray matter atrophy in the primary motor cortex (M1), primary somatosensory cortex (S1), supplementary motor area (SMA), and thalamus, as well as white matter atrophy in the corticospinal tracts at the level of the bilateral cerebral peduncles. In addition, gray matter volume in the primary motor cortex was positively correlated with the total American Spinal Injury Association motor score in patients with SCI. In conclusion, our findings suggest that SCI causes significant anatomical changes in the human sensorimotor system, and that these anatomical changes may occur in the early phase of SCI. Future treatments that aim to restore sensorimotor functions following SCI need to attend to these anatomical changes in the brain.

AB  - Abstract
The endocannabinoid system plays a major role in modulating memory. In the present study, we examined whether cannabinoid agonists influence the consolidation of stimulus–response/habit memory, a form of memory dependent upon the dorsolateral striatum (DLS). In Experiment 1, rats were trained in a cued platform water maze task in which animals were released from different start points and in order to escape had to find a cued platform which was moved to various spatial locations across trials. Immediately following training, rats received an i.p. injection of the cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN 55,212-2 (1 or 3 mg/kg) or a vehicle solution. In Experiment 2, rats were trained in a forced-response version of the water plus-maze task in which a consistent body-turn response was reinforced across trials. Immediately following training, rats received an i.p. injection of WIN 55,212-2 (3 mg/kg) or vehicle. In Experiment 3, rats were trained in the cued platform task and after training received bilateral intra-DLS WIN 55,212-2 (100 ng/.5 μL or 200 ng/.5 μL) or vehicle. In Experiments 1–3, the higher doses of WIN 55,212-2 were associated with significant memory impairments, relative to vehicle-treated controls. The results indicate that peripheral or intra-DLS administration of a cannabinoid receptor agonist impairs consolidation of DLS-dependent memory. The findings are discussed within the context of previous research encompassing cannabinoids and DLS-dependent learning and memory processes, and the possibility that cannabinoids may be used to treat some habit-like human psychopathologies (e.g. posttraumatic stress disorder) is considered.

AB  - Abstract
Aging decreases the density of spines and the proportion of thin spines in the non-human primate (NHP) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). In this study, we used confocal imaging of dye-loaded neurons to expand upon previous results regarding the effects of aging on spine density and morphology in the NHP dlPFC and compared these results to the effects of aging on pyramidal neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1). We confirmed that spine density, and particularly the density of thin spines, decreased with age in the dlPFC of rhesus monkeys. Furthermore, the average head diameter of non-stubby spines in the dlPFC was a better predictor than chronological age of the number of trials required to reach criterion on both the delayed response test of visuospatial working memory and the delayed nonmatching-to-sample test of recognition memory. By contrast, total spine density was lower on neurons in V1 than in dlPFC, and neither total spine density, thin spine density, nor spine size in V1 was affected by aging. Our results highlight the importance and selective vulnerability of dlPFC thin spines for optimal prefrontal-mediated cognitive function. Understanding the nature of the selective vulnerability of dlPFC thin spines as compared to the resilience of thin spines in V1 may be a promising area of research in the quest to prevent or ameliorate age-related cognitive decline.

AB  - Abstract
Studies in adult animals have demonstrated a beneficial effect of physical exercise on epileptic insults. Although the effects of physical exercise on the mature nervous system are well documented, its influence on the developing nervous system subjected to injuries in childhood has been little explored. The purpose of our study was to investigate whether a physical exercise program applied during brain development could influence the hippocampal plasticity of rats submitted to status epilepticus (SE) induced by pilocarpine model at two different ages of the postnatal period. Male Wistar rats aged 18 (P18) and 28 (P28) days were randomly divided into four groups: Control (CTRL), Exercise (EX), SE (SE) and SE Exercise (SE/EX) (n = 17 per group). After the aerobic exercise program, histological and behavioral (water maze) analyses were performed. Our results showed that only animals subjected to pilocarpine-induced SE at P28 presented spontaneous seizures during the observational period. A significant reduction in seizure frequency was observed in the SE/EX group compared to the SE group. In adulthood, animals submitted to early-life SE displayed impairment in long-term memory in the water maze task, while the exercise program reversed this deficit. Reduced mossy fiber sprouting in the dentate gyrus was noted in animals that presented spontaneous seizures (SE/EX vs SE). Exercise increased cell proliferation (Ki-67 staining) and anti-apoptotic response (bcl-2 staining) and reduced pro-apoptotic response (Bax staining) in animals of both ages of SE induction (P18/28). Exercise also modified the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in EX and SE/EX animals. Our findings indicate that in animals subjected to SE in the postnatal period a physical exercise program brings about beneficial effects on seizure frequency and hippocampal plasticity in later stages of life.

We used the cheek model of itch and pain in rats to determine the dose–response relationships for intradermal injection of serotonin and α methylserotonin on scratching behavior. We also determined the dose-related effects of intracisternally injected morphine on scratching, effects that were greatly reduced by administration of the opiate antagonist naloxone. We then examined the interactions of intradermal injection of serotonin and intracisternal injection of morphine on scratching and found that the two procedures act synergistically to increase itch. These results suggest that morphine applied to the CNS is capable of producing itch and greatly increasing itch originating in the skin (hyperknesis).

AB  - Abstract
The partial opioid agonist thienorphine is currently in Phase II clinical trials in China as a candidate drug for the treatment of opioid dependence. However, its effect on synaptic plasticity in the NAc (nucleus accumbens) remains unclear. In the present study, we measured structural parameters of the synaptic interface to investigate the effect of thienorphine, morphine or a combination of both on synaptic morphology in the NAc of rats. Expression of synaptophysin was also examined. Ultrastructural observation showed that synaptic alterations were less pronounced after chronic thienorphine administration than after chronic morphine administration. Animals that received thienorphine had thinner postsynaptic densities and shorter active zones in the NAc compared with those in the saline group, but the active zone was larger, and the cleft narrower, than those in the morphine group. Furthermore, synaptophysin expression in the NAc was significantly greater after chronic administration of thienorphine, morphine, or both, than after saline. These results identified interesting differences between thienorphine and morphine in their effects on synaptic structure and synaptophysin expression in the rat NAc. Further study is deserved to investigate thienorphine as a new treatment for opioid dependence.

AB  - Abstract
Zellweger syndrome (ZS) is a severe peroxisomal disorder caused by mutations in peroxisome biogenesis, or PEX, genes. A central hallmark of ZS is abnormal neuronal migration and neurodegeneration, which manifests as widespread neurological dysfunction. The molecular basis of ZS neuropathology is not well understood. Here we present findings using a mouse model of ZS neuropathology with conditional brain inactivation of the PEX13 gene. We demonstrate that PEX13 brain mutants display changes that reflect an abnormal serotonergic system – decreased levels of tryptophan hydroxylase-2, the rate-limiting enzyme of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) synthesis, dysmorphic 5-HT-positive neurons, abnormal distribution of 5-HT neurons, and dystrophic serotonergic axons. The raphe nuclei region of PEX13 brain mutants also display increased levels of apoptotic cells and reactive, inflammatory gliosis. Given the role of the serotonergic system in brain development and motor control, dysfunction of this system would account in part for the observed neurological changes of PEX13 brain mutants.

AB  - Abstract
In resting state, the dynamics of blood oxygen level-dependent signals recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) showed reliable modular structures. To explore the network property, previous research used to construct an adjacency matrix by Pearson’s correlation and prune it using stringent statistical threshold. However, traditional analyses may lose useful information at middle to moderate high correlation level. This resting fMRI study adopted full connection as a criterion to partition the adjacency matrix into composite sub-matrices (neural patterns) and investigated the associated community organization and network features. Modular consistency across subjects was assessed using scaled inclusivity index. Our results disclosed two neural patterns with reliable modular structures. Concordant with the results of traditional intervention, community detection analysis showed that neural pattern 1, the sub-matrix at highest correlation level, was composed of sensory–motor, visual associative, default mode/midline, temporal limbic and basal ganglia structures. The neural pattern 2 was situated at middle to moderate high correlation level and comprised two larger modules, possibly associated with mental processing of outer world (such as visuo-associative, auditory and sensory–motor networks) and inner homeostasis (such as default-mode, midline and limbic systems). Graph theoretical analyses further demonstrated that the network feature of neural pattern 1 was more local and segregate, whereas that of neural pattern 2 was more global and integrative. Our results suggest that future resting fMRI research may take the neural pattern at middle to moderate high correlation range into consideration, which has long been ignored in extant literature. The variation of neural pattern 2 could be relevant to individual characteristics of self-regulatory functions, and the disruption in its topology may underlie the pathology of several neuropsychiatric illnesses.

AB  - Abstract
The secreted glycoprotein reelin plays an indispensable role in neuronal migration during development and in regulating adult synaptic functions. The upstream mechanisms responsible for initiating and regulating the duration and magnitude of reelin signaling are largely unknown. Here we report that reelin is cleaved between EGF-like repeats 6–7 (R6–7) by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) under cell-free conditions. No changes were detected in the level of reelin and its fragments in the brains of tPA knockouts, implying that other unknown proteases are responsible for generating reelin fragments found constitutively in the adult brain. Induction of NMDAR-independent long-term potentiation with the potassium channel blocker tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA-Cl) led to a specific up-regulation of reelin processing at R6–7 in wild-type mice. In contrast, no changes in reelin expression and processing were observed in tPA knockouts following TEA-Cl treatment. These results demonstrate that synaptic potentiation results in tPA-dependent reelin processing and suggest that extracellular proteolysis of reelin may regulate reelin signaling in the adult brain.

The CNS white matter makes up about half of the human brain, and with advances in human imaging it is increasingly becoming clear that changes in the white matter play a major role in shaping human behavior and learning. However, the mechanisms underlying these white matter changes remain poorly understood. Within this special issue of Neuroscience on white matter, recent advances in our knowledge of the function of white matter, from the molecular level to human imaging, are reviewed. Collaboration between fields is essential to understand the function of the white matter, but due to differences in methods and field-specific ‘language’, communication is often hindered. In this review, we try to address this hindrance by introducing the methods and providing a basic background to myelin biology and human imaging as a prelude to the other reviews within this special issue.

Evidence from the animal literature suggests that post-training glucocorticoids (GCs) interact with noradrenergic activation at acquisition to enhance memory consolidation for emotional stimuli. While there is evidence that GCs enhance memory for emotional material in humans, the extent to which this depends on noradrenergic activation at encoding has not been explored. In this study, 20-mg hydrocortisone was administered to healthy young women (18–35 yrs old) in a double-blind fashion 10 min prior to viewing a series of emotional and neutral images. Saliva samples were taken at baseline, 10 min after drug or placebo administration, immediately after viewing the images, 10, 20, and 30 min after viewing the images. Participants returned 1 week later for a surprise recall test. Results suggest that, hydrocortisone administration resulted in emotional memory enhancement only in participants who displayed an increase in endogenous noradrenergic activation, measured via salivary alpha-amylase at encoding. These results support findings in the animal literature, and suggest that GC-induced memory enhancement relies on noradrenergic activation at encoding in women.

AB  - Abstract
Lower motor neuron dysfunction is one of the most debilitating neurological conditions and, as such, significantly impacts on the quality of life of affected individuals. Within the last decade, the engineering of mouse models of lower motor neuron diseases has facilitated the development of new therapeutic scenarios aimed at delaying or reversing the progression of these conditions. In this context, motor end plates (MEPs) are highly specialized regions on the skeletal musculature that offer minimally invasive access to the pre-synaptic nerve terminals, henceforth to the spinal cord motor neurons. Transgenic technologies can take advantage of the relationship between the MEP regions on the skeletal muscles and the corresponding motor neurons to shuttle therapeutic genes into specific compartments within the ventral horn of the spinal cord. The first aim of this neuroanatomical investigation was to map the details of the organization of the MEP zones for the main muscles of the mouse hindlimb. The hindlimb was selected for the present work, as it is currently a common target to challenge the efficacy of therapies aimed at alleviating neuromuscular dysfunction. This MEP map was then used to guide series of intramuscular injections of Fluoro-Gold (FG) along the muscles’ MEP zones, therefore revealing the distribution of the motor neurons that supply them. Targeting the entire MEP regions with FG increased the somatic availability of the retrograde tracer and, consequently, gave rise to FG-positive motor neurons that are organized into rostro-caudal columns spanning more spinal cord segments than previously reported. The results of this investigation will have positive implications for future studies involving the somatic delivery and retrograde transport of therapeutic transgenes into affected motor neurons. These data will also provide a framework for transgenic technologies aiming at maintaining the integrity of the neuromuscular junction for the treatment of lower motor neuron dysfunctions.

AB  - Abstract
Interleukin (IL)-17A plays an important role in the cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, the mechanisms are still largely unknown. Calpain-transient receptor potential canonical (subtype) 6 (TRPC6) signaling pathway has been recently found to be implicated in brain I/R injury. However, their relationships with IL-17A remain unknown. This study aims to test whether this important signaling has correlation with IL-17A and how they led to the neuronal damage in I/R injury. In the present study, mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (60 min) followed by reperfusion for different times. Infarct volumes and neurological deficits were examined. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blotting were conducted to detect IL-17A expression in the penumbral brain tissue. Activation of calpain and expression of TRPC6 were also studied. We found that cerebral I/R significantly increased the levels of IL-17A at 1, 3 and 6 days after reperfusion in the penumbral area. IL-17A knockout or anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody (mAb) significantly reduced whereas recombinant mouse-IL-17A (rIL-17A) increased the activation of calpain at 3 days after reperfusion. The calpain specific inhibitor calpeptin significantly increased TRPC6 expression. Brain injury and neurological deficits were largely abrogated by IL-17A knockout, anti-IL-17A mAb or calpeptin. Recombinant IL-17A treatment markedly increased I/R injury. In conclusion, IL-17A may promote brain I/R injury through the increase of calpain-mediated TRPC6 proteolysis. These results further outline a novel neuroprotective strategy with increased effectiveness for the inhibition of excess brain IL-17A in cerebral I/R injury.

AB  - Abstract
We have previously shown near infrared light (NIr), directed transcranially, mitigates the loss of dopaminergic cells in MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)-treated mice, a model of parkinsonism. These findings complement others suggesting NIr treatment protects against damage from various insults. However one puzzling feature of NIr treatment is that unilateral exposure can lead to a bilateral healing response, suggesting NIr may have ‘indirect’ protective effects. We investigated whether remote NIr treatment is neuroprotective by administering different MPTP doses (50-, 75-, 100-mg/kg) to mice and treating with 670-nm light directed specifically at either the head or body. Our results show that, despite no direct irradiation of the damaged tissue, remote NIr treatment produces a significant rescue of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta at the milder MPTP dose of 50-mg/kg (∼30% increase vs sham-treated MPTP mice, p &lt; 0.05). However this protection did not appear as robust as that achieved by direct irradiation of the head (∼50% increase vs sham-treated MPTP mice, p &lt; 0.001). There was no quantifiable protective effect of NIr at higher MPTP doses, irrespective of the delivery mode. Astrocyte and microglia cell numbers in substantia nigra pars compacta were not influenced by either mode of NIr treatment. In summary, the findings suggest that treatment of a remote tissue with NIr is sufficient to induce protection of the brain, reminiscent of the ‘abscopal effect’ sometimes observed in radiation treatment of metastatic cancer. This discovery has implications for the clinical translation of light-based therapies, providing an improved mode of delivery over transcranial irradiation.

AB  - Abstract
Sleep/wake disorders are frequently associated with anxiety and depression and to elevated levels of cortisol. Even though these alterations are increasingly sought in animal models, no study has investigated the specific effects of chronic corticosterone (CORT) administration on sleep. We characterized sleep/wake disorders in a neuroendocrine mouse model of anxiety/depression, based on chronic CORT administration in the drinking water (35 μg/ml for 4 weeks, “CORT model”). The CORT model was markedly affected during the dark phase by non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) increase without consistent alteration of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Total sleep duration (SD) and sleep efficiency (SE) increased concomitantly during both the 24 h and the dark phase, due to the increase in the number of NREM sleep episodes without a change in their mean duration. Conversely, the total duration of wake decreased due to a decrease in the mean duration of wake episodes despite an increase in their number. These results reflect hypersomnia by intrusion of NREM sleep during the active period as well as a decrease in sleep/wake continuity. In addition, NREM sleep was lighter, with an increased electroencephalogram (EEG) theta activity. With regard to REM sleep, the number and the duration of episodes decreased, specifically during the first part of the light period. REM and NREM sleep changes correlated respectively with the anxiety and the anxiety/depressive-like phenotypes, supporting the notion that studying sleep could be of predictive value for altered emotional behavior. The chronic CORT model in mice that displays hallmark characteristics of anxiety and depression provides an insight into understanding the changes in overall sleep architecture that occur under pathological conditions.

AB  - Abstract
Spinal microglia are widely recognized as activated by and contributing to the generation and maintenance of inflammatory and nerve injury related chronic pain; whereas the role of spinal astrocytes has received much less attention, despite being the first glial cells identified as activated following peripheral nerve injury. Recently it was suggested that microglia do not appear to play a significant role in chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), but in contrast astrocytes appear to have a key role. In spite of the generalizability of astrocyte recruitment across chemotherapy drugs, its correlation to the onset of the behavioral CIPN phenotype has not been determined. The astroglial and microglial markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and OX-42 were imaged here to examine glial reactivity in multiple models of CIPN over time and to contrast this response to that produced in the spinal nerve ligation (SNL) model. Microglia were strongly activated following SNL, but not activated at any of the time points observed following chemotherapy treatments. Astrocytes were activated following both oxaliplatin and bortezomib treatment in a manner that paralleled chemotherapy-evoked behavioral changes. Both the behavioral phenotype and activation of astrocytes were prevented by co-administration of minocycline hydrochloride in both CIPN models, suggesting a common mechanism.

AB  - Abstract
Axotomy of the rodent facial nerve represents a well-established model of synaptic plasticity. Post-traumatic “synaptic stripping” was originally discovered in this system. We report upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase MMP12 in regenerating motor neurons of the mouse and rat facial nucleus. Matrix metalloproteinases (matrix metallopeptidases, MMPs) are zinc-binding proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix and of regulating extracellular signaling networks including within synapses. MMP12 protein expression in facial motor neurons was enhanced following axotomy and peaked at day 3 after the operation. The peak of neuronal MMP12 expression preceded the peak of experimentally induced synaptic plasticity. At the same time, MMP12 redistributed intracellularly and became predominantly localized beneath the neuronal somatic cytoplasmic membrane. Both findings point to a role of MMP12 in the neuronal initiation of the synaptic stripping process. MMP12 is the first candidate molecule for such a trigger function and has potential as a therapeutic target. Moreover, since statins have been shown to increase the expression of MMP12, interference with synaptic stability may represent one mechanism by which these widely used drugs exert their side effects on higher CNS functions.

AB  - Abstract
The effects of extremely low-frequency electric fields (ELF-EFs, 3–300 Hz) on lipid peroxidation levels and antioxidant enzyme activities have been shown in many tissues and plasma after exposure to 50-Hz alternating current (AC) electric fields. However, similar studies investigating brain lipid peroxidation status are limited. Moreover and as far as we know, no study has been conducted to examine mismatch negativity (MMN) response in rats following exposure to a 50-Hz AC electric field. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to investigate different intensities and exposure durations of ELF-EFs on MMN component of event-related potentials (ERPs) as well as apoptosis and oxidative brain damage in rats. Ninety male rats, aged 3 months were used in our study. A total of six groups, composed of 15 animals each, was formed as follows: sham-exposed rats for 2 weeks (C2), sham-exposed rats for 4 weeks (C4), rats exposed to 12-kV/m and 18-kV/m electric fields for 2 weeks (E12-2 and E18-2), rats exposed to 12- and 18-kV/m electric fields for 4 weeks (E12-4 and E18-4). At the end of the experimental period, MMN responses were recorded in urethane-anesthetized rats by electrodes positioned stereotaxically to the surface of the dura. After MMN recordings, animals were killed by exsanguination and their brain tissues were removed for 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), protein carbonyl and TUNEL analysis. In the current study, different change patterns in ERP parameters were observed dependent on the intensity and exposure duration of ELF-EFs. There were differences in the amplitudes of ERP between the responses to the standard and the deviant tones in all groups. When peak-to-peak amplitude of the difference curves was evaluated, MMN amplitude was significantly decreased in the E18-4 group compared with the C4 group. Additionally, the amount of 4-HNE was increased in all experimental groups compared with the control group. Consequently, it could be concluded that electric field decreased MMN amplitudes possibly induced by lipid peroxidation.

AB  - Abstract
Androgen administration to castrated individuals was purported to decrease activity in the serotonin system. However, we found that androgen administration to castrated male macaques increased fenfluramine-induced serotonin release as reflected by increased prolactin secretion. In this study, we sought to define the effects of androgens and aromatase inhibition on serotonin-related gene expression in the dorsal raphe, as well as serotonergic innervation of the LC. Male Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) were castrated for 5–7 months and then treated for 3 months with (1) placebo, (2) testosterone (T), (3) dihydrotestosterone (DHT; non-aromatizable androgen) and ATD (steroidal aromatase inhibitor), or (4) Flutamide (FLUT; androgen antagonist) and ATD (n = 5/group). This study reports the expression of serotonin-related genes: tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) and the serotonin 1A autoreceptor (5HT1A) using digoxigenin-ISH and image analysis. To examine the production of serotonin and the serotonergic innervation of a target area underlying arousal and vigilance, we measured the serotonin axon density entering the LC with ICC and image analysis. TPH2 and SERT expression were significantly elevated in T- and DHT + ATD-treated groups over placebo- and FLUT + ATD-treated groups in the dorsal raphe (p &lt; 0.007). There was no difference in 5HT1A expression between the groups. There was a significant decrease in the pixel area of serotonin axons and in the number of varicosities in the LC across the treatment groups with T &gt; placebo &gt; DHT + ATD = FLUT + ATD treatments. Comparatively, T- and DHT + ATD-treated groups had elevated TPH2 and SERT gene expression, but the DHT + ATD group had markedly suppressed serotonin axon density relative to the T-treated group. Further comparison with previously published data indicated that TPH2 and SERT expression reflected yawning and basal prolactin secretion. The serotonin axon density in the LC agreed with the area under the fenfluramine-stimulated prolactin curve, providing a morphological basis for the pharmacological results. This suggested that androgen activity increased TPH2 and SERT gene expression but, aromatase activity, and neural production of estradiol (E), may subserve axonal serotonin and determination of the compartment acted upon by fenfluramine. In summary, androgens stimulated serotonin-related gene expression, but aromatase inhibition dissociated gene expression from the serotonin innervation of the LC terminal field and fenfluramine-stimulated prolactin secretion.

AB  - Abstract
Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the least treatable form of stroke and is associated with the worst prognosis. In up to 40% of cases, ICH is further complicated by intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), which predisposes to hydrocephalus, and increases case-mortality to 80%. However, IVH is not present in widely used preclinical models of ICH. Here, we characterize a novel rat model of combined ICH and IVH. Rats were injected with different volumes of autologous whole blood into the right deep basal ganglia region (100 μL, 150 μL, 200 μL, and 250 μL, n = 10 per group). MRI was performed immediately, and at 24, 48, 72 h, and 1 week after blood injection, along with neurological evaluations. Injected blood volume reliably correlated with blood volumes measured from MRI obtained after blood injection. Brain edema was most prominent in the ⩾200 μL groups, peaking at 48 h in all groups, being statistically different between the ⩾200 μL and &lt;200 μL groups at all-time points. Presence of hydrocephalus was detected in most of the animals, most clearly in the 200 μL and 250 μL groups, both being statistically different from the 100 μL group at all-time points, with tendency to worsen during the whole follow-up period. Most deteriorating neurological and behavioral outcomes as well as the highest mortality rates were detected in groups injected with 200 μL and 250 μL of autologous blood, 40% and 70%, respectively. These volumes were most similar to the clinical scenario of combined ICH and IVH, demonstrating that this novel rat model is a promising starting point for future ICH + IVH research.

AB  - Abstract
Decreased expression of CHRNA7, the gene encoding the α7∗ subtype of nicotinic receptor, may contribute to the cognitive dysfunction observed in schizophrenia by disrupting the inhibitory/excitatory balance in the hippocampus. C3H mice with reduced Chrna7 expression have significant reductions in hippocampal α7∗ receptor density, deficits in hippocampal auditory gating, increased hippocampal activity as well as significant decreases in hippocampal glutamate decarboxylase-65 (GAD65) and γ-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptor levels. The current study investigated whether altered Chrna7 expression is associated with changes in the levels of parvalbumin, GAD67 and/or GABAA receptor subunits in the hippocampus from male and female C3H Chrna7 wildtype, C3H Chrna7 heterozygous and C3H Chrna7 knockout (KO) mice using quantitative Western immunoblotting. Reduced Chrna7 expression was associated with significant increases in hippocampal parvalbumin and GAD67 and with complex alterations in GABAA receptor subunits. A decrease in α3 subunit protein was seen in both female C3H Chrna7 Het and KO mice while a decrease in α4 subunit protein was also detected in C3H Chrna7 KO mice with no sex difference. In contrast, an increase in δ subunit protein was observed in C3H Chrna7 Het mice while a decrease in this subunit was observed in C3H Chrna7 KO mice, with δ subunit protein levels being greater in males than in females. Finally, an increase in γ2 subunit protein was found in C3H Chrna7 KO mice with the levels of this subunit again being greater in males than in females. The increases in hippocampal parvalbumin and GAD67 observed in C3H Chrna7 mice are contrary to reports of reductions in these proteins in the postmortem hippocampus from schizophrenic individuals. We hypothesize that the disparate results may occur because of the influence of factors other than CHRNA7 that have been found to be abnormal in schizophrenia.

Physical activity influences inflammation, and both affect brain structure and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk. We hypothesized that older adults with greater reported physical activity intensity and lower serum levels of the inflammatory marker tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) would have larger regional brain volumes on subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.

In 43 cognitively intact older adults (79.3 ± 4.8 years) and 39 patients with AD (81.9 ± 5.1 years at the time of MRI) participating in the Cardiovascular Health Study, we examined year-1 reported physical activity intensity, year-5 blood serum TNFα measures, and year-9 volumetric brain MRI scans. We examined how prior physical activity intensity and TNFα related to subsequent total and regional brain volumes. Physical activity intensity was measured using the modified Minnesota Leisure Time Physical Activities questionnaire at year 1 of the study, when all subjects included here were cognitively intact.

Stability of measures was established for exercise intensity over 9 years and TNFα over 3 years in a subset of subjects who had these measurements at multiple time points. When considered together, more intense physical activity intensity and lower serum TNFα were both associated with greater total brain volume on follow-up MRI scans. TNFα, but not physical activity, was associated with regional volumes of the inferior parietal lobule, a region previously associated with inflammation in AD patients. Physical activity and TNFα may independently influence brain structure in older adults.

AB  - Abstract
Midbrain dopamine systems play important roles in Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, addiction, and depression. The participation of midbrain dopamine systems in diverse clinical contexts suggests these systems are highly complex. Midbrain dopamine regions contain at least three neuronal phenotypes: dopaminergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic. Here, we review the locations, subtypes, and functions of glutamatergic neurons within midbrain dopamine regions. Vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2) mRNA-expressing neurons are observed within each midbrain dopamine system. Within rat retrorubral field (RRF), large populations of VGluT2 neurons are observed throughout its anteroposterior extent. Within rat substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC), VGluT2 neurons are observed centrally and caudally, and are most dense within the laterodorsal subdivision. RRF and SNC rat VGluT2 neurons lack tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), making them an entirely distinct population of neurons from dopaminergic neurons. The rat ventral tegmental area (VTA) contains the most heterogeneous populations of VGluT2 neurons. VGluT2 neurons are found in each VTA subnucleus but are most dense within the anterior midline subnuclei. Some subpopulations of rat VGluT2 neurons co-express TH or glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), but most of the VGluT2 neurons lack TH or GAD. Different subsets of rat VGluT2-TH neurons exist based on the presence or absence of vesicular monoamine transporter 2, dopamine transporter, or D2 dopamine receptor. Thus, the capacity by which VGluT2-TH neurons may release dopamine will differ based on their capacity to accumulate vesicular dopamine, uptake extracellular dopamine, or be autoregulated by dopamine. Rat VTA VGluT2 neurons exhibit intrinsic VTA projections and extrinsic projections to the accumbens and to the prefrontal cortex. Mouse VTA VGluT2 neurons project to accumbens shell, prefrontal cortex, ventral pallidum, amygdala, and lateral habenula. Given their molecular diversity and participation in circuits involved in addiction, we hypothesize that individual VGluT2 subpopulations of neurons play unique roles in addiction and other disorders.

AB  - Abstract
The knowledge that diverse populations of dopaminergic neurons within the ventral tegmental area (VTA) can be distinguished in terms of their molecular, electrophysiological and functional properties, as well as their differential projections to cortical and subcortical regions has significance for key brain functions, such as the regulation of motivation, working memory and sensorimotor control. Almost without exception, this understanding has evolved from landmark studies performed in the male sex. However, converging evidence from both clinical and pre-clinical studies illustrates that the structure and functioning of the VTA dopaminergic systems are intrinsically different in males and females. This may be driven by sex differences in the hormonal environment during adulthood (‘activational’ effects) and development (perinatal and/or pubertal ‘organizational’ effects), as well as genetic factors, especially the SRY gene on the Y chromosome in males, which is expressed in a sub-population of adult midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Stress and stress hormones, especially glucocorticoids, are important factors which interact with the VTA dopaminergic systems in order to achieve behavioral adaptation and enable the individual to cope with environmental change. Here, also, there is male/female diversity not only during adulthood, but also in early life when neurobiological programing by stress or glucocorticoid exposure differentially impacts dopaminergic developmental trajectories in male and female brains. This may have enduring consequences for individual resilience or susceptibility to pathophysiological change induced by stressors in later life, with potential translational significance for sex bias commonly found in disorders involving dysfunction of the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic systems. These findings highlight the urgent need for a better understanding of the sexual dimorphism in the VTA if we are to improve strategies for the prevention and treatment of debilitating conditions which differentially affect men and women in their prevalence and nature, including schizophrenia, attention/deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorders, anxiety, depression and addiction.

AB  - Abstract
The ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the brain’s reward circuitry is composed of a heterogeneous population of dopamine, GABA, and glutamate neurons that play important roles in mediating mood-related functions including depression. These neurons project to different brain regions, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and the amygdala. The functional understanding of these projection pathways has been improved since the extensive use of advanced techniques such as viral-mediated gene transfer, cell-type-specific neurophysiology and circuit-probing optogenetics. In this article, we will discuss the recent progress in understanding these VTA projection-specific functions, focusing on mood-related disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Whether beauty and ugliness represent two independent judgement categories or, instead, opposite extremes of a single dimension is a matter of debate. In the present 3T-functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study, 20 participants were scanned while judging faces and nude bodies of people classified as extremely ugly, extremely beautiful, or indifferent. Certain areas, such as the caudate/nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), exhibited a linear relationship across esthetic judgments supporting ugliness as the lowest extreme of a beauty continuum. Other regions, such as basal occipital areas, displayed an inverse pattern, with the highest activations for ugly and the lowest for beautiful ones. Further, several areas were involved alike by both the very beautiful and the very ugly stimuli. Among these, the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC), as well as the posterior and medial portions of the cingulate gyrus. This is interpreted as the activation of neural circuits related to self- vs. other-assessment. Beauty and ugliness in the brain, at least in relation to natural and biologically and socially relevant stimuli (faces and bodies), appear tightly related and non-independent. Finally, neutral stimuli elicited strong and wide activations of the somatosensory and somatomotor systems together with longer reaction times and higher error rates, probably reflecting the difficulty of the human brain to classify someone as indifferent.

AB  - Abstract
Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)-containing afferent neurons convey nociceptive signals and play an essential role in pain sensation. Exposure to nerve growth factor (NGF) rapidly increases TRPV1 activity (sensitization). In the present study, we investigated whether treatment with the selective cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) agonist arachidonyl-2′-chloroethylamide (ACEA) affects NGF-induced sensitization of TRPV1 in adult mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) afferent neurons. We found that CB1, NGF receptor tyrosine kinase A (trkA), and TRPV1 are present in cultured adult mouse small- to medium-sized afferent neurons and treatment with NGF (100 ng/ml) for 30 min significantly increased the number of neurons that responded to capsaicin (as indicated by increased intracellular Ca2 + concentration). Pretreatment with the CB1 agonist ACEA (10 nM) inhibited the NGF-induced response, and this effect of ACEA was reversed by a selective CB1 antagonist. Further, pretreatment with ACEA inhibited NGF-induced phosphorylation of AKT. Blocking PI3 kinase activity also attenuated the NGF-induced increase in the number of neurons that responded to capsaicin. Our results indicate that the analgesic effect of CB1 activation may in part be due to inhibition of NGF-induced sensitization of TRPV1 and also that the effect of CB1 activation is at least partly mediated by attenuation of NGF-induced increased PI3 signaling.

AB  - Abstract
Alpha-synuclein (a-syn) is the major component of the intracytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy bodies (LB), which constitute the hallmark of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Mice overexpressing human a-syn under the Thy-1 promoter (ASO) show slow neurodegeneration and some behavioral deficits similar to those seen in human PD patients. Here, we describe a whole-brain distribution of human a-syn in adult ASO mice. We find that the human a-syn is ubiquitously distributed in the brain including the cerebellar cortex, but the intensity and sub-cellular localization of the staining differed in the various regions of the central nervous system. Among particular CNS areas with human a-syn immunoreactivity, we describe staining patterns in the olfactory bulb, cortex, hippocampus, thalamic region, brainstem nuclei and cerebellar cortex. This immunohistochemical study provides an anatomical map of the human a-syn distribution in ASO mice. Our data show that human a-syn, although not present at levels that were detectable by immunostaining in dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra or noradrenergic neurons of locus coeruleus, was highly expressed in other PD relevant regions of the brain in different neuronal subtypes. These data will help to relate a-syn expression to the phenotypic manifestations observed in this widely used mouse line.

AB  - Abstract
The involvement of the central nervous system in the pathophysiology of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) has been noticed. TMD patients have been shown dysfunction of motor performance and reduced cognitive ability in neuropsychological tests. The aim of this study is to explore the spontaneous neural activity in TMD patients with centric relation (CR)–maximum intercuspation (MI) discrepancy before and after stabilization splint treatment. Twenty-three patients and twenty controls underwent clinical evaluations, including CR–MI discrepancy, Helkimo indices and chronic pain, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans at baseline. Eleven patients repeated the evaluations and scanning after the initial wearing (T1) and 3 months of wearing (T2) of the stabilization splint. The fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) was calculated to compare the neural functions. At baseline, the patients showed decreased fALFF in the left precentral gyrus, supplementary motor area, middle frontal gyrus and right orbitofrontal cortex compared with the controls (P &lt; 0.05, AlphaSim corrected). Negative correlations were found between the fALFF in the left precentral gyrus and vertical CR–MI discrepancy of bilateral temporomandibular joints of patients (P &lt; 0.05, two-tailed). At T2, the symptoms and signs of the patients were improved, and a stable condylar position on the CR was recovered, with increased fALFF in the left precentral gyrus and left posterior insula compared with pretreatment. The fALFF decrease in the patients before treatment was no longer evident at T2 compared with the controls. The results suggested that TMD patients with CR–MI discrepancy showed significantly decreased brain activity in their frontal cortexes. The stabilization splint elicited functional recovery in these cortical areas. These findings provided insight into the cortical neuroplastic processes underlying TMD with CR–MI discrepancy and the therapeutic mechanisms of stabilization splint.

AB  - Abstract
Amphetamine-type psychostimulants (ATS) are used worldwide by millions of patients for several psychiatric disorders. Amphetamine (AMPH) and “ecstasy” (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine or MDMA) are common drugs of abuse. The impact of chronic ATS exposure to neurons and brain aging is still undisclosed.

Current neuronal culture paradigms are designed to access acute ATS toxicity. We report for the first time a model of chronic exposure to AMPH and MDMA using long-term rat cortical cultures. In two paradigms, ATS were applied to neurons at day 1 in vitro (DIV) (0, 1, 10 and 100 μM of each drug) up to 28 days (200 μM was applied to cultures up to 14 DIV). Our reincubation protocol assured no decrease in the neuronal media’s drug concentration. Chronic exposure of neurons to concentrations equal to or above 100 μM of ATS up to 28 DIV promoted significant mitochondrial dysfunction and elicited neuronal death, which was not prevented by glutamate receptor antagonists at 14 DIV. ATS failed to promote accelerated senescence as no increase in β-galactosidase activity at 21 DIV was found. In younger cultures (4 or 8 DIV), AMPH promoted mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal death earlier than MDMA. Overall, AMPH proved more toxic and was the only drug that decreased intraneuronal glutathione levels. Meanwhile, caspase 3 activity increased for either drug at 200 μM in younger cultures at 8 DIV, but not at 14 DIV. At 8 DIV, ATS promoted a significant change in the percentage of neurons and astroglia present in culture, promoting a global decrease in the number of both cells. Importantly, concentrations equal to or below 10 μM of either drug did not promote neuronal death or oxidative stress.

Our paradigm of neuronal cultures long-term exposure to low micromolar concentrations of ATS closely reproduces the in vivo scenario, being valuable to study the chronic impact of ATS.

AB  - Abstract
Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of focal epilepsies in adults. It is often initiated by an insult or brain injury which triggers a series of alterations which ultimately lead to seizures (epilepsy). In 50–70% of people with TLE the condition cannot be adequately treated by the present antiepileptic drugs. During the last decade the blood–brain barrier (BBB) has received renewed interest as a potential target to treat TLE or its progression. BBB changes have been observed in brain tissue of people with epilepsy as well as in experimental models at the structural, cellular and molecular level that could explain its role in the development and progression of epilepsy (epileptogenesis) as well as the development of drug resistance. Here, we will discuss the role of the BBB in TLE and drug resistance and summarize potential new therapies that may restore normal BBB function in order to put a brake on epileptogenesis and/or to improve drug treatment.

AB  - Abstract
Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), the target cells of the cochlear implant, undergo gradual degeneration following loss of the sensory epithelium in deafness. The preservation of a viable population of SGNs in deafness can be achieved in animal models with exogenous application of neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3. For translation into clinical application, a suitable delivery strategy that provides ongoing neurotrophic support and promotes long-term SGN survival is required. Cell-based neurotrophin treatment has the potential to meet the specific requirements for clinical application, and we have previously reported that Schwann cells genetically modified to express BDNF can support SGN survival in deafness for 4 weeks. This study aimed to investigate various parameters important for the development of a long-term cell-based neurotrophin treatment to support SGN survival. Specifically, we investigated different (i) cell types, (ii) gene transfer methods and (iii) neurotrophins, in order to determine which variables may provide long-term neurotrophin expression and which, therefore, may be the most effective for supporting long-term SGN survival in vivo. We found that fibroblasts that were nucleofected to express BDNF provided the most sustained neurotrophin expression, with ongoing BDNF expression for at least 30 weeks. In addition, the secreted neurotrophin was biologically active and elicited survival effects on SGNs in vitro. Nucleofected fibroblasts may therefore represent a method for safe, long-term delivery of neurotrophins to the deafened cochlea to support SGN survival in deafness.

AB  - Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common and devastating neurodegenerative disease. The etiology of AD has yet to be fully understood, and common treatments remain largely non-efficacious. The amyloid hypothesis posits that extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits are the fundamental etiological factor of the disease. The present study tested the organoselenium compound diphenyl-diselenide (PhSe)2, which is characterized by its antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties and has shown efficacy in several neurodegenerative disease models. We employed a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans AD model to analyze the effects of (PhSe)2 treatment on Aβ peptide-induced toxicity. Chronic exposure to (PhSe)2 attenuated oxidative stress induced by Aβ1–42, with concomitant recovery of associative learning memory in C. elegans. Additionally, (PhSe)2 decreased Aβ1–42 transgene expression, suppressed Aβ1–42 peptide, and downregulated hsp-16.2 by reducing the need for this chaperone under Aβ1–42-induced toxicity. These observations suggest that (PhSe)2 plays an important role in protecting against oxidative stress-induced toxicity, thus representing a promising pharmaceutical modality that attenuates Aβ1–42 expression.

AB  - Abstract
Depending on an animal’s behavioral state, hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells receive distinct patterns of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. The time-dependent changes in the frequencies of these inputs and the nonuniform distribution of voltage-gated channels lead to dynamic fluctuations in membrane conductance. In this study, using a whole-cell patch-clamp method, we attempted to record and analyze the frequency dependencies of membrane responsiveness in Wistar rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells following noise current injection directly into dendrites and somata under pharmacological blockade of all synaptic inputs. To estimate the frequency-dependent properties of membrane potential, membrane impedance was determined from the voltage response divided by the input current in the frequency domain. The cell membrane of most neurons showed low-pass filtering properties in all regions. In particular, the properties were strongly expressed in the somata or proximal dendrites. Moreover, the data revealed nonuniform distribution of dendritic impedance, which was high in the intermediate segment of the apical dendritic shaft (∼220–260 μm from the soma). The low-pass filtering properties in the apical dendrites were more enhanced by membrane depolarization than those in the somata. Coherence spectral analysis revealed high coherence between the input signal and the output voltage response in the theta–gamma frequency range, and large lags emerged in the distal dendrites in the gamma frequency range. Our results suggest that apical dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells integrate synaptic inputs according to the frequency components of the input signal along the dendritic segments receiving the inputs.

AB  - Abstract
Frontal areas are thought to be the coordinators of working memory processes by controlling other brain areas reflected by oscillatory activities like frontal-midline theta (4–7 Hz). With aging substantial changes can be observed in the frontal brain areas, presumably leading to age-associated changes in cortical correlates of cognitive functioning. The present study aimed to test whether altered frontal-midline theta dynamics during working memory maintenance may underlie the capacity deficits observed in older adults. 33-channel EEG was recorded in young (18–26 years, N = 20) and old (60–71 years, N = 16) adults during the retention period of a visual delayed match-to-sample task, in which they had to maintain arrays of 3 or 5 colored squares. An additional visual odd-ball task was used to be able to measure the electrophysiological indices of sustained attentional processes. Old participants showed reduced frontal theta activity during both tasks compared to the young group. In the young memory maintenance-related frontal-midline theta activity was shown to be sensitive both to the increased memory demands and to efficient subsequent memory performance, whereas the old adults showed no such task-related difference in the frontal theta activity. The decrease of frontal-midline theta activity in the old group indicates that cerebral aging may alter the cortical circuitries of theta dynamics, thereby leading to age-associated decline of working memory maintenance function.

AB  - Abstract
Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) binds select mRNAs, functions in intracellular transport of these mRNAs and represses their translation. FMRP is highly expressed in neurons and lack of FMRP has been shown to result in dendritic dysmorphology and altered synaptic function. FMRP is known to interact with mRNAs for the Kv3.1b potassium channel which is required for neurons to fire action potentials at high rates with remarkable temporal precision. Auditory brainstem neurons are known for remarkably high spike rates and expression of Kv3.1b potassium channels. Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (Fmr1) resulting in decreased expression of FMRP and subsequent intellectual disability, seizures, attention deficit and hypersensitivity to auditory and other sensory stimuli. We therefore hypothesize that the auditory difficulties in FXS result, at least in part, from dysfunction of auditory brainstem neurons. To examine this hypothesis, we have studied normal human brainstem tissue with immunohistochemical techniques and confocal microscopy. Our results demonstrate that FMRP is widely expressed in cell bodies and dendritic arbors of neurons in the human cochlear nucleus and superior olivary complex and also that coincidence detector neurons of the medial superior olive colocalization of FMRP and Kv3.1b. We interpret these observations to suggest that the lower auditory brainstem is a potential site of dysfunction in FXS.

AB  - AbstractObject
The purpose of this study was to investigate functional alterations of the brain in the early stage of spinal cord injury (SCI) and further investigate how these functional alterations relate to SCI patients’ sensorimotor functions.
Methods
Twenty-five patients with SCI and 25 matched healthy controls underwent imaging by using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) were used to characterize regional neural function, and the seed-based functional connectivity (FC) was used to evaluate the functional integration of the brain network.
Results
Compared to healthy controls, patients with SCI showed decreased ALFF in the bilateral primary sensorimotor cortex, and increased ALFF in the bilateral cerebellum and right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The ALFF value in the left cerebellum was negatively correlated with the clinical total motor score in patients with SCI. Furthermore, SCI patients mainly showed decreased inter-hemispheric FC between the bilateral primary sensorimotor cortex, as well as increased intra-hemispheric FC within the motor network, including the primary sensorimotor cortex, premotor cortex, supplementary motor area (SMA), thalamus and cerebellum. Subsequent correlation analyses revealed that increased FC within the primary sensorimotor cortex, SMA, and cerebellum negatively correlated with the total American Spinal Cord Injury Association (ASIA) motor score.
Conclusions
Our findings provide evidence that SCI can induce significant regional and network-level functional alterations in the early stage of the disease. We hypothesized these alterations may be an adaptive phenomenon following SCI, reflecting a compensatory mechanism during the early stage of SCI.

AB  - Abstract
Metformin a well known antidiabetic drug has been recently investigated and proposed to promote neurogenesis and enhance the spatial memory formation. In the present study, we aim to investigate the neuroprotective effect of metformin with respect to Parkinson’s disease (PD). MPTP (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) (25 mg/kg) along with Probenecid (250 mg/kg) was administrated for five consecutive days to induce Parkinsonism in mice. Metformin 500 mg/kg was administrated orally for 21 days. Motor co-ordination and locomotor activities were evaluated by rotarod and open-field tests. The oxidative stress levels were assessed by estimating the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) specifically in the midbrain. Dopaminergic degeneration was evaluated by analyzing the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) by immunostaining and nissl staining of the substantia nigra (SN) region of the brain. In addition brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was also estimated.

Our findings demonstrated that long-term metformin treatment resulted in significant improvement of the locomotor and muscular activities in MPTP-treated mice than acute treatment. Metformin treatment significantly improved the antioxidant activity as compared to MPTP-treated group. TH-positive cells decreased up to 16% in MPTP-treated mice as compared to normal mice (P &lt; 0.001) and were found to be protected from degeneration in metformin-treated mice (47%, P &lt; 0.01). Interestingly, BDNF levels were found to be significantly elevated in metformin treatment group as compared to MPTP treatment mice (P &lt; 0.001).

In conclusion, metformin possesses neuroprotective activity and provides preclinical support for therapeutic prospective of this compound in the treatment of PD.

AB  - Abstract
The anterior hypothalamus (Ant Hyp) of the brain serves as the main regulator of numerous homeostatic functions, among them body temperature. Fine-tuning of the thermal-response set point during the critical postnatal sensory-developmental period involves neuronal network remodeling which might also be accompanied by alterations in hypothalamic cell populations. Here we demonstrate that heat stress during the critical period of thermal-control establishment interferes with generation of new cells in the chick hypothalamus. Whereas conditioning of the 3-day-old chicks under high ambient temperatures for 24 h diminished the number of newborn cells in anterior hypothalamic structures 1 week after the treatment, mild heat stress did not influence the amount of new cells. Phenotypic analysis of these newborn cells indicated a predominant decrease in non-neuronal cell precursors, i.e. cells that do not express doublecortin (DCX). Furthermore, heat challenge of 10-day-old previously high-temperature-conditioned chicks abolished hypothalamic neurogenesis and significantly decreased the number of cells of non-neural origin. As a potential regulatory mechanism for the underlying generation of new cells in the hypothalamus, we investigated the role of the microRNA (miRNA) miR-138, previously reported by us to promote hypothalamic cell migration in vitro and whose levels are reduced during heat stress. Intracranial injection into the third ventricle of miR-138 led to an increase in the number of newborn cells in the Ant Hyp, an effect which might be partially mediated by inhibition of its direct target reelin. These data demonstrate the role of ambient temperature on the generation of new cells in the hypothalamus during the critical period of thermal-control establishment and highlight the long-term effect of severe heat stress on hypothalamic cell population. Moreover, miRNAs, miR-138 in particular, can regulate new cell generation in the hypothalamus.

AB  - Abstract
Pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA3 area interconnect intensively via recurrent axonal collaterals, and such CA3-to-CA3 recurrent circuitry plays important roles in the generation of hippocampal network activities. In particular, the CA3 circuitry is able to generate spontaneous sharp waves (SPWs) when examined in vitro. These in vitro SPWs are thought to result from the network activity of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons as SPW-correlating intracellular activities are featured with strong IPSPs in pyramidal neurons and EPSPs or spikes in GABAergic interneurons. In view of accumulating evidence indicating a decrease in subgroups of hippocampal GABAergic interneurons in aged animals, we test the hypothesis that the intracellular activities related to in vitro SPWs are altered in CA3 pyramidal neurons of aged mice. Hippocampal slices were prepared from adult and aged C57 black mice (ages 3–6 and 24–28 months respectively). Population and single-cell activities were examined via extracellular and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. CA3 SPW frequencies were not significantly different between the slices of adult and aged mice but SPW-correlating intracellular activities featured weaker IPSC components in aged CA3 pyramidal neurons compared to adult neurons. It was unlikely that this latter phenomenon was due to general impairments of GABAergic synapses in the aged CA3 circuitry as evoked IPSC responses and pharmacologically isolated IPSCs were observed in aged CA3 pyramidal neurons. In addition, aged CA3 pyramidal neurons displayed more positive resting potentials and had a higher propensity of burst firing than adult neurons. We postulate that alterations of GABAergic network activity may explain the reduced IPCS contributions to in vitro SPWs in aged CA3 pyramidal neurons. Overall, our present observations are supportive of the notion that excitability of hippocampal CA3 circuitry is increased in aged mice.

AB  - Abstract
Dopamine (DA) neurons in the midbrain are crucial for motivational control of behavior. However, recent studies suggest that signals transmitted by DA neurons are heterogeneous. This may reflect a wide range of inputs to DA neurons, but which signals are provided by which brain areas is still unclear. Here we focused on the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg) in macaque monkeys and characterized its inputs to DA neurons. Since the PPTg projects to many brain areas, it is crucial to identify PPTg neurons that project to DA neuron areas. For this purpose we used antidromic activation technique by electrically stimulating three locations (medial, central, lateral) in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). We found SNc-projecting neurons mainly in the PPTg, and some in the cuneiform nucleus. Electrical stimulation in the SNc-projecting PPTg regions induced a burst of spikes in presumed DA neurons, suggesting that the PPTg–DA (SNc) connection is excitatory. Behavioral tasks and clinical tests showed that the SNc-projecting PPTg neurons encoded reward, sensorimotor and arousal/alerting signals. Importantly, reward-related PPTg neurons tended to project to the medial and central SNc, whereas sensorimotor/arousal/alerting-related PPTg neurons tended to project to the lateral SNc. Most reward-related signals were positively biased: excitation and inhibition when a better and worse reward was expected, respectively. These PPTg neurons tended to retain the reward value signal until after a reward outcome, representing ‘value state’; this was different from DA neurons which show phasic signals representing ‘value change’. Our data, together with previous studies, suggest that PPTg neurons send positive reward-related signals mainly to the medial–central SNc where DA neurons encode motivational values, and sensorimotor/arousal signals to the lateral SNc where DA neurons encode motivational salience.

AB  - Abstract
The temporo-parietal (TP) white matter connections between the inferior parietal lobule and superior temporal gyrus as part of the superior longitudinal fasciculus/arcuate fasciculus (SLF/AF) or middle longitudinal fasciculus (MdLF) have been studied in prior diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) studies. However, few studies have been focusing on the higher TP connections of the superior parietal lobule with the temporal lobe. These higher TP connections have been shown to have a role in core processes such as attention, memory, emotions, and language. Our most recent study, for the first time, hinted to the possibility of a long white matter connection interconnecting the superior parietal lobule (SPL) with the posterior temporal lobe in human brain which we call the SLF/AF TP-SPL and for a shorter abbreviation, the TP-SPL. We decided to further investigate this white matter connection using fiber assignment by continuous tracking deterministic tractography and high spatial resolution diffusion tensor imaging on 3T. Five healthy right-handed men (age range 24–37 years) were studied. We delineated the SPL connections of the SLF/AF TP bilaterally in five normal adult human brains. Using a high resolution DTT technique, we demonstrate for the first time, the trajectory of a long fiber bundle connectivity between the SPL and posterior temporal lobe, called the SLF/AF TP-SPL (or the TP-SPL), bilaterally in five healthy adult human brains. We also demonstrate the trajectory of the vertically oriented posterior TP connections, interconnecting the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) with the posterior temporal lobe (TP-IPL) in relation to the TP-SPL, arcuate fasciculus and other major language pathways. In the current study, for the first time, we categorized the TP connections into the anterior and posterior connectivity groups and subcategorized each one into the SPL or IPL connections.

AB  - Abstract
Evidence is emerging that reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced oxidative stress has a crucial role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. To find the effective therapies for neurodegenerative diseases, evaluation of the relevant molecular mechanisms is necessary. In the current study, we investigated the effects of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress on SK-N-MC cell death with focus on HIF-1α, Foxo3a and Notch1 signaling factors. Our results revealed that H2O2 reduced viability of cells through up-regulation of p53 followed by increase in Bax/Bcl2 ratio. In addition, H2O2 increased intracellular levels of HIF-1α, Foxo-3a and Notch intracellular domain (NICD). However, Quercetin decreased cell contents of HIF-1α, Foxo-3a and NICD as well as pro-apoptotic factors including p53 and Bax compared to H2O2-treated cells. Additionally, we found that HIF-1α down-regulation reduced Foxo3a and NICD contents parallel to up-regulation of p53 and Bax and led to further vulnerability to oxidative stress-induced cell death. In contrast, Notch inhibition resulted in HIF-1α/Foxo3a signaling pathway up-regulation, suggesting the bidirectional crosstalk between HIF-1α and Notch1. These results collectively suggest that ROS are involved in activation of both the defensive and pro-apoptotic pathways encompassing HIF-1α and p53, respectively. Regarding the HIF-1α-mediated neuroprotection role, elucidation of the molecular mechanism would certainly be essential for effective drug design against neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Abstract
The normal function of GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition is governed by several factors, including release of GABA, subunit composition and density of the receptors and in particular by the appropriate ionic gradient. In the human epileptogenic neocortex an impaired chloride (Cl−) gradient has been proposed, due to decreases of potassium-coupled chloride transport (KCC2) and voltage-gated Cl− channels (ClC). Regarding sodium- and potassium-coupled Cl− transport (NKCC1) both up- and downregulations have been proposed.

We investigated changes of Cl− homeostasis of human and rat neocortical neurons (layer 2/3) with intracellular recordings and iontophoretic Cl− loading employing selective compounds. After cessation of iontophoresis, the IPSPA amplitudes of rat neurons recovered with a time constant (τrec) of 6.5 s (n = 21). In human neurons, τrec averaged 17.8 s (n = 36; 23 resections). Application of the novel KCC2 blocker VU0240551 (1 μM) caused in rat neurons a reversible prolongation of τrec from 5.7 to 8.1 s (n = 11), corresponding to a VU0240551-sensitive Cl− transport rate (1/Δτrec) of 0.0504 s−1. In human neurons, τrec increased on application of 1 μM VU0240551, on average from 15.1 to 20.3 s (n = 17). The human neurons comprised two subgroups with different τrec when segregated according to a border given by the mean + 2 s.d. of rat neurons. In one group, τrec averaged 8.7 s (n = 6) and reversibly increased to 14.6 s in the presence of 1 μM VU0240551, corresponding to a Cl− transport rate of 0.0504 s−1. The other group had an average τrec of 18.5 s which increased in the presence of 1 μM VU0240551 to 23.3 s (n = 11), indicating a much smaller rate (0.0151 s−1). Addition of DIDS, a presumed blocker of anion exchanger (AE), increased the τrec of rat neurons from 7.5 to 8.8 s (n = 6) corresponding to a DIDS-sensitive rate of 0.0185 s−1. In human neurons, DIDS increased τrec from 23.3 to 50.7 s (n = 7), corresponding to a DIDS-sensitive rate of 0.0200 s−1.

These data suggest a greatly reduced KCC2-mediated transport rate in most of the human neurons. The two subgroups observed in human tissue indicate a considerable variability of Cl− transport within a given tissue from almost normal to greatly impeded, predominated by a decline of KCC2 whereas AE is unaltered.

AB  - Abstract
Homeostatic plasticity is engaged when neurons need to stabilize their synaptic strength and excitability in response to acute or prolonged destabilizing changes in global activity. Compared to the extensive studies investigating the molecular mechanisms for homeostatic synaptic plasticity, the mechanism underlying homeostatic intrinsic plasticity is largely unknown. Through whole-cell patch-clamp recording in low-density cultures of dissociated hippocampal neurons, we demonstrate here that prolonged activity blockade induced by the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) leads to increased action potential firing rates. Conversely, prolonged activity enhancement induced by the A-type gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor antagonist bicuculline (BC) results in decreased firing rates. Prolonged activity enhancement also enhanced potassium (K+) current through Kv1 channels, suggesting that changes in K+ current, in part, mediate stabilization of hippocampal neuronal excitability upon prolonged activity elevation. In contrast to the previous reports showing that L-type voltage-gated calcium (Ca2+) channels solely mediate homeostatic regulation of excitatory synaptic strength (Ibata et al., 2008; Goold and Nicoll, 2010), inhibition of N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors alone mimics the elevation in firing frequency driven by prolonged TTX application, while the decrease in firing rates induced by prolonged BC treatment involves the activity of NMDA receptors and L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. These results collectively provide strong evidence that alterations in Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors and L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels mediate homeostatic intrinsic plasticity in hippocampal neurons in response to prolonged activity changes.

AB  - Abstract
Alterations in hippocampal neurogenesis affect spatial learning, though, the relative contributions of cell proliferation and cell survival on this process are poorly understood. The current study utilized mu opioid receptor (MOR-1) knockout (KO) mice on two background strains, C57BL/6 and 129S6, to assess cell survival as well as determine the impact on spatial learning using the Morris water maze. These experiments were designed to extend prior work showing that both C57BL/6 and 129S6 MOR-1 KO mice have an increased number of proliferating cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) when compared to wild-type (WT) mice. The current study indicates that newly born neurons in the DG of C57BL/6 MOR-1 KO mice exhibit enhanced survival when compared to WT mice, while new neurons in the DG of 129S6 MOR-1 KO mice do not. In addition, C57BL/6 MOR-1 KO mice have a lower number of apoptotic cells in the DG compared to WT mice while, in contrast, 129S6 MOR-1 KO mice have a higher number of apoptotic cells in this region. These alterations collectively contribute to an increase in the granule cell number in the DG of C57BL/6 MOR-1 KO mice, while the total number of granule cells in 129S6 MOR-1 KO mice is unchanged. Thus, although C57BL/6 and 129S6 MOR-1 KO mice both exhibit increased cell proliferation in the DG, the impact of the MOR-1 mutation on cell survival differs between strains. Furthermore, the decrease in DG cell survival displayed by 129S6 MOR-1 KO mice is correlated with functional deficits in spatial learning, suggesting that MOR-1-dependent alterations in the survival of new neurons in the DG, and not MOR-1-dependent changes in proliferation of progenitor cells in the DG, is important for spatial learning.

AB  - Abstract
The developing brain is talkative but its language is not that of the adult. Most if not all voltage and transmitter-gated ionic currents follow a developmental sequence and network-driven patterns differ in immature and adult brains. This is best illustrated in studies engaged almost three decades ago in which we observed elevated intracellular chloride (Cl−)i levels and excitatory GABA early during development and a perinatal excitatory/inhibitory shift. This sequence is observed in a wide range of brain structures and animal species suggesting that it has been conserved throughout evolution. It is mediated primarily by a developmentally regulated expression of the NKCC1 and KCC2 chloride importer and exporter respectively. The GABAergic depolarization acts in synergy with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated and voltage-gated calcium currents to enhance intracellular calcium exerting trophic effects on neuritic growth, migration and synapse formation. These sequences can be deviated in utero by genetic or environmental insults leading to a persistence of immature features in the adult brain. This “neuroarcheology” concept paves the way to novel therapeutic perspectives based on the use of drugs that block immature but not adult currents. This is illustrated notably with the return to immature high levels of chloride and excitatory actions of GABA observed in many pathological conditions. This is due to the fact that in the immature brain a down regulation of KCC2 and an up regulation of NKCC1 are seen. Here, I present a personal history of how an unexpected observation led to novel concepts in developmental neurobiology and putative treatments of autism and other developmental disorders. Being a personal account, this review is neither exhaustive nor provides an update of this topic with all the studies that have contributed to this evolution. We all rely on previous inventors to allow science to advance. Here, I present a personal summary of this topic primarily to illustrate why we often fail to comprehend the implications of our own observations. They remind us – and policy deciders – why Science cannot be programed, requiring time, and risky investigations that raise interesting questions before being translated from bench to bed. Discoveries are always on sideways, never on highways.

AB  - Abstract
The cholinergic system is implicated in visuospatial attention and inhibition, however the exact role is still unclear. Two key mechanisms in visuospatial attention are bias and disengagement. Bias refers to neuronal signals that enhance the sensitivity of the sensory cortex, disengagement is the decoupling of attention. Previous studies suggest that nicotine affects disengagement and (related) inhibition. However the exact relation is still unknown. Furthermore, nicotine-abstinence in ‘healthy’ smokers may resemble some anomalies of visuospatial attention and inhibition as seen in Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Smokers and non-smokers (32 male students) performed in a visuospatial cueing (VSC) task, to assess bias and disengagement, and in a stop-signal task (SST) to assess inhibition. It was expected that nicotine abstinent smokers compared to non-smokers, would show poor disengagement (indicated by an enhanced validity effect) and poor inhibitory control (indicated by an enhanced stop-signal reaction time (SSRT)). It was expected that nicotine would positively affect disengagement and inhibition: hypothesis 1 stated that this effect would be larger in smokers as opposed to non-smokers, in terms of smoking-related deficient inhibitory control. Hypothesis 2 stated the exact opposite, in terms of drug-tolerance. Results indicated no baseline differences. Nicotine enhanced inhibition more in non-smokers relative to smokers. Integrating the results, nicotine-abstinent smokers do not seem to resemble ADHD patients, and do not seem to smoke in order to self-medicate a pre-existing deficit pertaining to mechanisms of visuospatial attention and inhibition. Nicotine may affect inhibition more in non-smokers relative to smokers, consistent with a drug-tolerance account.

AB  - Abstract
Striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) is a brain-specific tyrosine phosphatase that has been shown to de-phosphorylate several key neuronal signaling proteins, including kinases (extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), FYN, PYK2) and glutamate receptor subunits (N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subtype 2B (NR2B), glutamate receptor 2 (GLUR2)). Step knock-out mice have increased phosphorylation of these substrates in the brain, with potential functional consequences in synaptic plasticity and cognitive tasks. It is therefore of interest to identify the molecular pathways and downstream transcriptional targets that are impacted by Step knockdown. In the present study, striatal RNA samples from Step wild-type, knock-out and heterozygous mice were hybridized to Affymetrix microarray chips and evaluated for transcriptional changes between genotypes. Pathway analysis highlighted Erk signaling and multiple pathways related to neurotrophin signaling, neuronal development and synaptic transmission. Potential genes of interest identified by microarray were confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in the cortex and hippocampus, which shared several transcriptional alterations with the striatum. In order to evaluate Step knockdown in an in vitro system, a panel of genes were evaluated using qRT-PCR in rat cortical neurons that were transduced with lentivirus expressing short hairpin RNA against Step or a non-targeting control. Our data suggest that Step has a role in the expression of immediate early genes relevant to synaptic plasticity, in both in vitro and in vivo systems.

AB  - Abstract
One of the most striking demonstrations of experience-dependent plasticity comes from studies of sensory-deprived individuals (e.g., blind or deaf), showing that brain regions deprived of their natural inputs change their sensory tuning to support the processing of inputs coming from the spared senses. These mechanisms of crossmodal plasticity have been traditionally conceptualized as having a double-edged sword effect on behavior. On one side, crossmodal plasticity is conceived as adaptive for the development of enhanced behavioral skills in the remaining senses of early-deaf or blind individuals. On the other side, crossmodal plasticity raises crucial challenges for sensory restoration and is typically conceived as maladaptive since its presence may prevent optimal recovery in sensory-re-afferented individuals. In the present review we stress that this dichotomic vision is oversimplified and we emphasize that the notions of the unavoidable adaptive/maladaptive effects of crossmodal reorganization for sensory compensation/restoration may actually be misleading. For this purpose we critically review the findings from the blind and deaf literatures, highlighting the complementary nature of these two fields of research. The integrated framework we propose here has the potential to impact on the way rehabilitation programs for sensory recovery are carried out, with the promising prospect of eventually improving their final outcomes.

AB  - Abstract
Mindfulness is typically defined as nonjudgmental awareness of experiences in the present moment, which is beneficial for mental and physical well-being. Previous studies have identified multiple regions in the default mode network (DMN) that are involved in mindfulness, but little is known about how these regions work collaboratively as a network. Here, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the role of the DMN in trait mindfulness by correlating spontaneous functional connectivity among DMN nodes with self-reported trait mindfulness in a large population of young human adults. Among all pairs of the DMN nodes, we found that individuals with weaker functional connectivity between the thalamus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) were more mindful of the present. Post-hoc analyses of these two nodes further revealed that graph-based nodal properties of the thalamus, not the PCC, were negatively correlated with trait mindfulness, suggesting that a low involvement of the thalamus in the DMN is relevant for high trait mindfulness. Our findings not only suggest the thalamus as a switch between mind-wandering and mindfulness, but also invite future studies on mechanisms of how mindfulness produces beneficial effects by modulating the thalamus.

AB  - Abstract
Interpersonal synchrony is characterized by a temporary alignment of periodic behaviors with another person. This process requires that at least one of the two individuals monitors and adjusts his/her movements to maintain alignment with the other individual (the referent). Interestingly, recent research on interpersonal synchrony has found that people who are motivated to befriend an unfamiliar social referent tend to automatically synchronize with their social referents, raising the possibility that synchrony may be employed as an affiliation tool. It is unknown, however, whether the opposite is true; that is, whether the person serving as the referent of interpersonal synchrony perceives synchrony with his/her partner or experiences affiliative feelings toward the partner.

To address this question, we performed a series of studies on interpersonal synchrony with a total of 100 participants. In all studies, participants served as the referent with no requirement to monitor or align their behavior with their partners. Unbeknown to the participants, the timings of their “partner’s” movements were actually determined by a computer program based on the participant’s (i.e., referent’s) behavior.

Overall, our behavioral results showed that the referent of a synchrony task expressed greater perceived synchrony and greater social affiliation toward a synchronous partner (i.e., one displaying low mean asynchrony and/or a narrow asynchrony range) than with an asynchronous partner (i.e., one displaying high mean asynchrony and/or high asynchrony range). Our neuroimaging study extended these results by demonstrating involvement of brain areas implicated in social cognition, embodied cognition, self-other expansion, and action observation as correlates of interpersonal synchrony (vs. asynchrony). These findings have practical implications for social interaction and theoretical implications for understanding interpersonal synchrony and social coordination.

AB  - Abstract
Cornea-evoked eyeblinks maintain tear film integrity on the ocular surface in response to dryness and protect the eye from real or potential damage. Eyelid movement following electrical stimulation has been well studied in humans and animals; however, the central neural pathways that mediate protective eyeblinks following natural nociceptive signals are less certain. The aim of this study was to assess the role of the trigeminal subnucleus interpolaris/caudalis (Vi/Vc) transition and subnucleus caudalis/upper cervical cord (Vc/C1) junction regions on orbicularis oculi electromyographic (OOemg) activity evoked by ocular surface application of hypertonic saline or exposure to bright light in urethane anesthetized male rats. The Vi/Vc and Vc/C1 regions are the main sites of termination for trigeminal afferent nerves that supply the ocular surface, while hypertonic saline (saline = 0.15–5 M) and bright light (light = 5k–20k lux) selectively activate ocular surface and intraocular trigeminal nerves, respectively, and excite second-order neurons at the Vi/Vc and Vc/C1 regions. Integrated OOemg activity, ipsilateral to the applied stimulus, increased with greater stimulus intensities for both modalities. Lidocaine applied to the ocular surface inhibited OOemg responses to hypertonic saline, but did not alter the response to light. Lidocaine injected into the trigeminal ganglion blocked completely the OOemg responses to hypertonic saline and light indicating a trigeminal afferent origin. Synaptic blockade by cobalt chloride of the Vi/Vc or Vc/C1 region greatly reduced OOemg responses to hypertonic saline and bright light. These data indicate that OOemg activity evoked by natural stimuli known to cause irritation or discomfort in humans depends on a relay in both the Vi/Vc transition and Vc/C1 junction regions.

AB  - Abstract
The habenular complex, encompassing medial (MHb) and lateral (LHb) divisions, is a highly conserved epithalamic structure involved in the dorsal diencephalic conduction system (DDC). These brain nuclei regulate information flow between the limbic forebrain and the mid- and hindbrain, integrating cognitive with emotional and sensory processes. The MHb is also one of the strongest expression sites for mu opioid receptors (MORs), which mediate analgesic and rewarding properties of opiates. At present however, anatomical distribution and function of these receptors have been poorly studied in MHb pathways. Here we took advantage of a newly generated MOR-mcherry knock-in mouse line to characterize MOR expression sites in the DDC.

MOR-mcherry fluorescent signal is weak in the LHb, but strong expression is visible in the MHb, fasciculus retroflexus (fr) and interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), indicating that MOR is mainly present in the MHb–IPN pathway. MOR-mcherry cell bodies are detected both in basolateral and apical parts of MHb, where the receptor co-localizes with cholinergic and substance P (SP) neurons, respectively, representing two main MHb neuronal populations. MOR-mcherry is expressed in most MHb-SP neurons, and is present in only a subpopulation of MHb-cholinergic neurons. Intense diffuse fluorescence detected in lateral and rostral parts of the IPN further suggests that MOR-mcherry is transported to terminals of these SP and cholinergic neurons. Finally, MOR-mcherry is present in septal regions projecting to the MHb, and in neurons of the central and intermediate IPN.

Together, this study describes MOR expression in several compartments of the MHb–IPN circuitry. The remarkably high MOR density in the MHb–IPN pathway suggests that these receptors are in a unique position to mediate analgesic, autonomic and reward responses.

AB  - Abstract
Disruption of bacterial colonization during the early postnatal period is increasingly being linked to adverse health outcomes. Indeed, there is a growing appreciation that the gut microbiota plays a role in neurodevelopment. However, there is a paucity of information on the consequences of early-life manipulations of the gut microbiota on behavior.

To this end we administered an antibiotic (vancomycin) from postnatal days 4–13 to male rat pups and assessed behavioral and physiological measures across all aspects of the brain–gut axis. In addition, we sought to confirm and expand the effects of early-life antibiotic treatment using a different antibiotic strategy (a cocktail of pimaricin, bacitracin, neomycin; orally) during the same time period in both female and male rat pups.

Vancomycin significantly altered the microbiota, which was restored to control levels by 8 weeks of age. Notably, vancomycin-treated animals displayed visceral hypersensitivity in adulthood without any significant effect on anxiety responses as assessed in the elevated plus maze or open field tests. Moreover, cognitive performance in the Morris water maze was not affected by early-life dysbiosis. Immune and stress-related physiological responses were equally unaffected. The early-life antibiotic-induced visceral hypersensitivity was also observed in male rats given the antibiotic cocktail. Both treatments did not alter visceral pain perception in female rats. Changes in visceral pain perception in males were paralleled by distinct decreases in the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1, the α-2A adrenergic receptor and cholecystokinin B receptor.

In conclusion, a temporary disruption of the gut microbiota in early-life results in very specific and long-lasting changes in visceral sensitivity in male rats, a hallmark of stress-related functional disorders of the brain–gut axis such as irritable bowel disorder.

AB  - Abstract
Sex and reproductive status affect hippocampal neurogenesis and dentate gyrus (DG) size in rodents. Relatively few studies, however, address these two effects simultaneously and even fewer studies address this issue in wild populations. Here, we examined seasonal and sex differences in neurogenesis and DG size in a wild, polygynous and social rodent, Richardson’s ground squirrel (Uriocitellus richardsonii). Based on the behavioral ecology of this species, we predicted that both neurogenesis and DG size would be sexually dimorphic and the degree of dimorphism would be greatest in the breeding season. Using unbiased stereology and doublecortin (DCX) immunohistochemistry, we found that brain volume, DG size and number of DCX cells varied significantly between breeding and non-breeding seasons, but only brain volume and the number of DCX labeled cells differed between the sexes. Both sex and seasonal differences likely reflect circulating hormone levels, but the extent to which these differences relate to space use in this species is unclear. Based on the degree of seasonal differences in neurogenesis and the DG, we suggest that ground squirrels could be considered model species in which to examine hippocampal plasticity in an ecologically valid context.

AB  - Abstract
Somatostatin (SRIF) modulates neurotransmitter release by activating the specific receptors (sst1-sst5). Our previous study showed that sst5 receptors are expressed in rat retinal GABAergic amacrine cells. Here, we investigated modulation of GABA release by SRIF in cultured amacrine cells, using patch-clamp techniques. The frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in the amacrine cells was significantly reduced by SRIF, which was partially reversed by BIM 23056, an sst5 receptor antagonist, and was further rescued by addition of CYN-154806, an sst2 receptor antagonist. Both nimodipine, an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, and ω-conotoxin GVIA, an N-type Ca2+ channel blocker, suppressed the sIPSC frequency, and in the presence of nimodipine and ω-conotoxin GVIA, SRIF failed to further suppress the sIPSC frequency. Extracellular application of forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, increased the sIPSC frequency, while the membrane permeable protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor Rp-cAMP reduced it, and in the presence of Rp-cAMP, SRIF did not change sIPSCs. However, SRIF persisted to suppress the sIPSCs in the presence of KT5823, a protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor. Moreover, pre-incubation with Bis IV, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, or pre-application of xestospongin C, an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) inhibitor, SRIF still suppressed the sIPSC frequency. All these results suggest that SRIF suppresses GABA release from the amacrine cells by inhibiting presynaptic Ca2+ channels, in part through activating sst5/sst2 receptors, a process that is mediated by the intracellular cAMP–PKA signaling pathway.

AB  - Abstract
The magnocellular medial preoptic nucleus (MPN mag) plays a critical role in the regulation of male copulatory behavior in the Syrian hamster. Our study of the afferents are consistent with the hypothesis that the MPN mag receives input from areas in the chemosensory pathway and nuclear groups that contain receptors for gonadal steroids (Wang and Swann, 2006). The goal of the present study is to identify targets of the MPN mag by describing the location of labeled fibers following an injection of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) into the MPN mag. Our results indicate that targets of the MPN mag include: (1) brainstem nuclei implicated in regulating male mating behavior in other species, such as the periaqueductal gray, deep mesencephalic nucleus, retrorubral field, ventral tegmental area and lateral paragigantocellular nucleus and (2) steroid-concentrating nuclei in the septum, preoptic area and hypothalamus. The lack of projections from the MPN mag to its chemosensory afferents indicate that the connections of the MPN mag with the posterior medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial and anterior cortical nuclei of the amygdala are unidirectional, and that chemosensory information flows from the medial amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) to the MPN mag. The bidirectional nature of the connections between the MPN mag and steroid-concentrating nuclei suggest that the MPN mag may influence the function of a steroid-concentrating network that regulates behaviors. Together these results support the hypothesis that the MPN mag regulates male mating behavior by integrating chemosensory and hormonal signals and relaying this information to brainstem areas that control motor output.

AB  - Abstract
N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) at layer (L)1/primary whisker motor cortex synaptic inputs are distinct from thalamic/striatal (Str) synaptic inputs onto L5 pyramidal neurons in the rat somatosensory cortex. However, the consequences of differential expression of putative GluN3A-containing triheteromeric NMDARs at L1 inputs and GluN2A-containing diheteromeric NMDARs at Str inputs on plasticity of the underlying synapses at the respective inputs remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that L1, but not Str, synapses are potentiated following delta burst stimulation (dBS). This potentiation is blocked by d-serine and/or intracellular 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) suggesting that it is subunit-specific and dependent on elevations in intracellular Ca2+. Interestingly, ifenprodil, the GluN2B-preferring antagonist, suppresses baseline L1 responses but does not prevent induction of dBS-evoked potentiation. Unlike L1, Str synapses are maximally potentiated following theta burst stimulation (tBS) and this potentiation is blocked with BAPTA and/or the GluN2A-preferring antagonist NVP-AAM077. We show further that while dBS is both necessary and sufficient to potentiate L1 synapses, tBS is most effective in potentiating Str synapses. Our data suggest distinct potentiating paradigms for the two convergent inputs onto pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex and co-dependence of synaptic potentiation on brain wave-tuned frequencies of burst stimulation and subunit composition of underlying NMDARs. A model for predicting the likelihood of enhancing synaptic efficacy is proposed based on Ca2+ influx through these receptors and integration of EPSPs at these inputs. Together, these findings raise the possibility of input-specific enhancements of synaptic efficacy in neurons as a function of the animal’s behavioral state and/or arousal in vivo.

Embryonic stem (ES) cells secrete some soluble factors which may affect the differentiation potential of adult stem cells toward different lineages. In the present study, we evaluated neural differentiation of mouse adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) following coculture with ES cells. For this purpose, ADSCs were induced in a medium supplemented with a synthetic serum replacement and various concentrations of retinoic acid (RA). Then, third-passaged ADSCs were indirectly cocultured with ES cells, and the expression levels of pluripotency markers, OCT4 and Sox2, mesenchymal stem cell markers, CD73 and CD105, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), were assessed in the cocultured ADSCs. Moreover, the control and cocultured ADSCs were differentiated with or without RA treatment. We showed here that 2-week differentiated ADSCs expressed several neuron-specific genes, and RA treatment improved neural differentiation of the ADSCs. The expression levels of OCT4, Sox2 and PCNA were upregulated in the cocultured ADSCs. Moreover, coculture with the ES cells significantly improved neural differentiation of the ADSCs. Treatment of the cocultured ADSCs with RA diminished the expression of neural maturation markers. Coculture with the ES cells efficiently improves neural differentiation of the ADSCs. Non-contact coculture with the ES cells may be used as an efficient strategy to improve differentiation potential of adult stem cells for developmental studies and regenerative medicine.

A spinal generator for ejaculation (SGE) has been identified in the rat that orchestrates peripheral events leading to ejaculation. Despite physiological evidence of cerebral influences exerted on the SGE, brain-descending pathways to the SGE have not been fully delineated. A tracing study combining retrograde and anterograde approaches was undertaken in adult male rats in order to identify brain sites containing neurons that directly project onto SGE neurons. Fluorogold (FG) was microinjected as a retrograde tracer into the SGE area in the central medial gray of the third lumbar (L3) spinal segment. FG-positive neurons were found in various structures in medulla oblongata, pons, and forebrain. Among the brain structures already known as participating in the brain control of ejaculation and harboring retrogradelly-labeled neurons, the ventrolateral part of the gigantocellular nucleus and the raphe pallidus/magnus in medulla oblongata as well as the lateral hypothalamus were targeted with the anterograde tracer dextran amine (DA). Galanin and substance P receptor (NK1) were used as markers of SGE neurons. DA-positive fibers and varicosities originating in the targeted brain sites were found to make close appositions with neurons expressing galanin or NK1 receptors in central medial gray of L3–L4 spinal segments. This study provides new insights regarding the anatomical support for the brain control of ejaculation via direct influences onto the SGE.

AB  - Abstract
Paced Auditory Serial-Addition Task (PASAT) is a complex task commonly used to examine patients with diffuse brain damage. A visual version of the neuropsychological test (Paced Visual Serial-Addition Task, PVSAT) has also been introduced to clinical practice, and both versions were adapted to be used in neuroimaging, namely functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The aim of our work was direct comparison of auditory and visual versions of the paced serial addition test (PASAT/PVSAT) in a within-subject and within-session study and description of the commonalities and differences in both activated and deactivated brain regions.

Twenty young adult right-handed healthy volunteers participated in the study and underwent whole-brain fMRI examination during PASAT and PVSAT performance. Higher-level statistical analysis was performed to generate group mean activation and deactivation maps for both tasks, their conjunctions and differences across modalities.

In PASAT/PVSAT activation conjunction analysis, we confirmed the existence of a modality-independent neural network similar to working memory tasks and to previous PASAT or PVSAT studies. In PASAT/PVSAT deactivation conjunction analysis, we observed a rather symmetrical extensive pattern of deactivated regions, overlapping the default mode network. Significant differences between PASAT and PVSAT were found in the right frontal eye field (FEF) and bilaterally in the striate and extrastriate cortices. Activation in one task and deactivation in the other jointly contributed to significant differences in all occipital and occipitotemporal regions. Both tasks activated right FEF, but activation during PASAT was significantly stronger than during PVSAT. Between-modality differences should be considered when preparing and interpreting neuroimaging experiments.

AB  - Abstract
Increasing evidence points to an essential role played by neuron-derived neurosteroids, such as estrogen, on synaptic connectivity in the hippocampus. Inhibition of local estradiol synthesis results in synapse loss specifically in females, but not in males. Synapse loss in females, after inhibition of estradiol synthesis in hippocampal neurons, appears to result from impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP) and dephosphorylation of cofilin, and thereby the destabilization of postsynaptic dendritic spines. Such clear-cut effects were not seen in males. Cognitive deficits after inhibition of aromatase, the final enzyme of estrogen synthesis, have been seen in women, but not in men. Altogether, the data demonstrate distinct differences between genders in neurosteroid-induced synaptic stability.

AB  - Abstract
Experiences with a high degree of emotional salience are better remembered than events that have little emotional context and the amygdala is thought to play an important role in this enhancement of memory. Visual recognition memory relies on synaptic plasticity in the perirhinal cortex but little is known about the mechanisms that may underlie emotional enhancement of this form of memory. There is good evidence that noradrenaline acting via β-adrenoceptors (β-ADRs) can enhance memory consolidation. In the present study we examine the role of β-ADRs in synaptic plasticity at the amygdala–perirhinal pathway (LA–PRh) and compare this to mechanisms of intra-perirhinal (PRh–PRh) synaptic plasticity. We demonstrate that activity-dependent PRh–PRh long-term potentiation (LTP) does not rely on β1- or β2-ADRs and that LA–PRh LTP relies on β1-ADRs but not β2-ADRs. We further demonstrate that application of the β-ADR agonist isoprenaline produces lasting PRh–PRh potentiation but only transient potentiation at the LA–PRh input. However, at the LA–PRh input, combining stimulation that is subthreshold for LTP induction with isoprenaline results in long-lasting potentiation. Isoprenaline-induced and isoprenaline plus subthreshold stimulation-induced potentiation in the PRh–PRh and LA–PRh inputs, respectively were both dependent on activation of NMDARs (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors), voltage-gated calcium channels and PKA (protein kinase A). Understanding the mechanisms of amygdala–perirhinal cortex plasticity will allow a greater understanding of how emotionally-charged events are remembered.

AB  - Abstract
We examined changes in the variability, frequency composition, and complexity of force signal from subacute to chronic stage of stroke during maintenance of isometric knee extension and compared these parameters between chronic stroke and healthy subjects. The sample included 15 healthy (65 ± 8 years) and 23 chronic stroke subjects (65 ± 14 years, 6–112 months post-stroke) of whom 10 (64 ± 15 years) were also examined 11–22 days post-stroke (subacute stage). The subjects performed isometric knee extension at 10%, 20%, 30%, and 50% of peak torque for 10 s (two trials each). Coefficient of variation (CV) was used as a measure of force variability. The median frequency and relative power in the 0–3, 4–6, and 8–12 Hz bands were obtained through a power spectrum analysis of the force signal. The signal complexity was quantified using the sample entropy (SampEn). The longitudinal analysis revealed a significant decrease in CV from subacute to chronic stage across all contraction levels (P &lt; 0.001) but no significant changes in the frequency and entropy parameters. Comparison between the chronic stroke and control subjects revealed no significant difference in CV across the force levels (P &gt; 0.05) but significantly decreased median frequency (P &lt; 0.01), with the relative power increased in 0–3 Hz band and decreased in 4–6 and 8–12 Hz bands in both paretic and non-paretic legs (P &lt; 0.001). SampEn was also significantly decreased in chronic stroke, bilaterally (P &lt; 0.001). These results indicate a shift toward lower frequencies and a less complex physiological process underlying force control in chronic stroke. The overall results suggest the improvement in force variability from subacute to chronic stroke but without normalization in the frequency composition and complexity of the force signal. Thus, disordered structure of the force signal remains a marker of impaired motor control long after stroke occurrence despite apparent recovery in force variability.

AB  - Abstract
Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) exerts neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects on substantia nigra (SN) dopamine neurons and has great therapeutic potential for Parkinson’s disease (PD). Hindering this potential is the fact that GDNF cannot cross the blood–brain barrier. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of GDNF administered by the intranasal route in normal rats, and in the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model of PD. In the first study, rats received single intranasal doses of 50-μg GDNF in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or cationic liposomes, but no 6-OHDA. In the second study, rats were nasally administered 10, 50 or 150 μg of GDNF in PBS or cationic liposomes 1 h before injection of 6-OHDA. All groups were sacrificed 3–4 weeks later. Both intranasal GDNF treatments induced a neurotrophic effect in the SN insofar as the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons was significantly higher than in controls given intranasal PBS liposomes. Dopamine cell counts were also higher in the intact SN of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats compared to controls given PBS liposomes. Most importantly, intranasal GDNF provided significant neuroprotective efficacy indicated by greater TH immunostaining density in the lesioned versus intact SN of rats given single 50-μg doses of GDNF in PBS, or 150-μg doses of liposomal GDNF, compared to lesioned rats given PBS liposomes. Three 50-μg doses given at daily intervals (1 day before, 1 h before, and 1 day after 6-OHDA) provided even greater protection than single 150-μg doses. Multiple doses at short intervals may therefore provide greater neuroprotection than single bolus doses. These results demonstrate both a neurotrophic effect of intranasal GDNF in the intact SN as well as neuroprotective efficacy in the unilateral 6-OHDA model, supporting pursuit of this approach as a potential treatment for PD.

AB  - Abstract
Accumulating evidence suggested that hyperglycemia played a critical role in hippocampus dysfunction in patients with diabetes mellitus. However, the multifactorial pathogenesis of hyperglycemia-induced impairments of hippocampal neurons has not been fully elucidated. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been shown to enhance learning and memory and affect neural function in various experimental conditions. The present study investigated the effects of DHA on the lipid peroxidation, the level of inflammatory cytokines and neuron apoptosis in the hippocampal neurons in high-glucose condition. High-glucose administration increased the level of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and IL-6, induced oxidative stress and apoptosis of hippocampal neurons in vitro. DHA treatment reduced oxidative stress and TNF-α expression, protected the hippocampal neurons by increasing AKT phosphorylation and decreasing caspase-3 and caspase-9 expression. These results suggested that high-glucose exposure induced injury of hippocampal neurons in vitro, and the principle mechanisms involved in the neuroprotective effect of DHA were its antioxidant and anti-apoptotic potential. DHA may thus be of use in preventing or treating neuron-degeneration resulting from hyperglycemia.

AB  - Abstract
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disease characterized by inflammation and degeneration within the CNS. Over the course of the disease, most MS patients successively accumulate inflammatory lesions, axonal damage, and a rather diffuse CNS pathology, along with an increasing degree of disability. Pharmacological treatment options which are currently approved for MS aim at limiting inflammation and decreasing the relapse rate, or at simply relieving symptoms. Established disease-modifying and immunosuppressive treatments are unable to prevent the accumulation of pathology in most patients over long-term. Therefore, therapies promoting the innate ability of the CNS to compensate for dysfunction resulting from brain injury might be highly beneficial in MS. As a precondition, however, development of such strategies requires well-grounded knowledge about the extent to which central plasticity is intact and accessible in MS patients, and whether it is functionally relevant at all.

This review will focus on plasticity of the motor system in patients with MS. A number of functional imaging studies have assessed patterns of brain activation during simple motor tasks in MS patients and their relationship with CNS damage and motor function. Deeper insights about causal and functional relationships were gained by neurophysiological techniques, predominantly by transcranial magnetic stimulation. In addition, and probably closest to rehabilitative approaches, practice-induced plasticity has been probed in a few studies. Altogether, there is growing evidence for a preservation of rapid-onset motor plasticity and for functionally relevant chronic reorganization processes, which might be limited by high CNS injury in advanced stages of the disease. Clinical implications of these findings with regard to the development and optimization of rehabilitative treatments in MS are discussed, as well as open questions which need to be addressed by future studies.

AB  - Abstract
Inosine (hypoxanthine 9-beta-d-ribofuranoside), a purine nucleoside with multiple intracellular roles, also serves as an extracellular modulatory signal. On neurons, it can produce anti-inflammatory and trophic effects that confer protection against toxic influences in vivo and in vitro. The protective effects of inosine treatment might also be mediated by its metabolite urate. Urate in fact possesses potent antioxidant properties and has been reported to be protective in preclinical Parkinson’s disease (PD) studies and to be an inverse risk factor for both the development and progression of PD. In this study we assessed whether inosine might protect rodent MES 23.5 dopaminergic cell line from oxidative stress in a cellular model of PD, and whether its effects could be attributed to urate. MES 23.5 cells cultured alone or in presence of enriched murine astroglial cultures MES 23.5–astrocytes co-cultures were pretreated with inosine (0.1–100 μM) for 24 h before addition of the oxidative stress inducer H2O2 (200 μM). Twenty-four hours later, cell viability was quantified by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay or immunocytochemistry in pure and MES 23.5–astrocytes co-cultures, respectively. H2O2-toxic effect on dopaminergic cells was reduced when they were cultured with astrocytes, but not when they were cultured alone. Moreover, in MES 23.5–astrocytes co-cultures, indicators of free radical generation and oxidative damage, evaluated by nitrite (NO2−) release and protein carbonyl content, respectively, were attenuated. Conditioned medium experiments indicated that the protective effect of inosine relies on the release of a protective factor from inosine-stimulated astrocytes. Purine levels were measured in the cellular extract and conditioned medium using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. Urate concentration was not significantly increased by inosine treatment however there was a significant increase in levels of other purine metabolites, such as adenosine, hypoxanthine and xanthine. In particular, in MES 23.5–astrocytes co-cultures, inosine medium content was reduced by 99% and hypoxanthine increased by 127-fold. Taken together these data raise the possibility that inosine might have a protective effect in PD that is independent of any effects mediated through its metabolite urate.

AB  - Abstract
Functional interactions between dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems occur in many brain areas, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Biochemical, electrophysiological and behavioral data indicate crosstalk between D1 dopamine receptor (D1R) and α1-adrenergic receptor (α1AR) signaling in the PFC. However, it is unknown whether these interactions occur within the same neurons, or between neurons expressing either receptor. In this study, we used electron microscopy immunocytochemistry to demonstrate that D1Rs and α1ARs co-localize in rat PFC neuronal elements, most prominently in dendrites (60–70%), but also significantly in axon terminals, unmyelinated axons and spines (∼20–30%). Our data also showed that the ratio of plasma membrane-bound to intracellular α1ARs is significantly reduced in D1R-expressing dendrites. Similar results were obtained using either a pan-α1AR or a selective α1bAR antibody to label noradrenergic receptors. Thus, these results demonstrate that D1Rs and α1ARs co-localize in PFC dendrites, thereby suggesting that the catecholaminergic effects on PFC function may be driven, at least in part, by cell-autonomous D1R–α1AR interactions.

AB  - Abstract
Numerous epidemiological studies have shown an association between pesticide exposure and the increased risk of developing Parkinson’s disease. Previously we have reported that Dichlorvos exposure can induce oxidative stress, resulting in over-expression of pro-apoptotic genes and finally caspase-dependent nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuronal cell death in rat brain. Here, we examined the effect of caspase inhibition on PC12 cell death induced by Dichlorvos (30 μM). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation followed by protein carbonylation, lipid peroxidation, decreased antioxidant defenses (decreased Mn-superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) activity and decreased glutathione levels) and subsequent caspase activation mediated the apoptosis. Inhibition of caspase cascade with Boc-aspartyl(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (BAF) enhanced the Dichlorvos-induced PC12 cell death, as assessed by the increased cellular efflux of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This increase in cell death was accompanied by a marked increase in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) activity, increased oxidative stress, a reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced cellular NAD and ATP levels. Pretreatment of cells with PJ34, a PARP1 inhibitor prevented the cells from undergoing cell death and preserved intracellular NAD and ATP levels. Subsequent release of the apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria and its translocation into the nucleus was also prevented by PJ34 pretreatment. In conclusion, the results of the present study show that caspase inhibition without concurrent inhibition of PARP1 is unlikely to be effective in preventing cell death because in the presence of the caspase inhibitor, caspase-independent cell death predominates due to PARP activation. These results suggest that combined therapeutic strategies directed at multiple cell death pathways may provide superior neuroprotection than those directed at a single mechanism.

AB  - Abstract
It has been argued that arm movements are important during human gait because they affect leg activity due to neural coupling between arms and legs. Consequently, one would expect that locomotor-like alternating arm swing is more effective than in-phase swing in affecting the legs’ motor output. Other alternating movements such as trunk rotation associated to arm swing could also affect leg reflexes. Here, we assessed how locomotor-like movement patterns would affect soleus H-reflexes in 13 subjects performing arm swing in the sagittal plane (ipsilateral, contralateral and bilateral in-phase versus locomotor-like anti-phase arm movements) and trunk rotation with the legs stationary, and leg stepping with the arms stationary. Findings revealed that soleus H-reflexes were suppressed for all arm, trunk or leg movements. However, a marked reflex modulation occurred during locomotor-like anti-phase arm swing, as was also the case during leg stepping, and this modulation flattened out during in-phase arm swing. This modulation had a peculiar bell shape and showed maximum suppression at a moment where the heel-strike would occur during a normal walking cycle. Furthermore, this modulation was independent from electromyographic activity, suggesting a spinal processing at premotoneuronal level. Therefore, trunk movement can affect legs’ output, and a special neural coupling occurs between arms and legs when arms move in alternation. This may have implications for gait rehabilitation.

AB  - Abstract
Bryostatin-1, a potent agonist of protein kinase C (PKC), has recently been found to enhance spatial learning and long-term memory in rats, mice, rabbits and the nudibranch Hermissenda, and to exert profound neuroprotective effects on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in transgenic mice. However, details of the mechanistic effects of bryostatin on learning and memory remain unclear. To address this issue, whole-cell recording, a dual-recording approach and extracellular recording techniques were performed on young (2–4 months) Brown-Norway rats. We found that bath-applied bryostatin-1 significantly increased the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs). The firing rate of GABAergic interneurons significantly was also increased as recorded with a loosely-attached extracellular recording configuration. Simultaneous recordings from communicating cell pairs of interneuron and pyramidal neuron revealed unique activity-dependent properties of GABAergic synapses. Furthermore, the bryostatin-induced increase of the frequency and amplitude of IPSCs was blocked by methionine enkephalin which selectively suppressed the excitability of interneurons. Pretreatment with RO-32-0432, a relatively specific PKCα antagonist, blocked the effect of bryostatin on sIPSCs. Finally, bryostatin increased paired-pulse ratio of GABAergic synapses that lasted for at least 20 min while pretreatment with RO-32-0432 significantly reduced the ratio. In addition, 8-[2-(2-pentyl-cyclopropylmethl)-cyclopropyl]-octanoic acid (DCP-LA), a selective PKCε activator, also increased the frequency and amplitude of sIPSCs. Taken together, these results suggest that bryostatin enhances GABAergic neurotransmission in pyramidal neurons by activating the PKCα &amp; ε-dependent pathway and by a presynaptic mechanism with excitation of GABAergic interneurons. These effects of bryostatin on GABAergic transmissions and modifiability may contribute to the improvement of learning and memory previously observed to be induced by bryostatin.

AB  - Abstract
Borna disease virus (BDV) is a neurotropic, non-cytolytic RNA virus which replicates in the cell nucleus targeting mainly hippocampal neurons, but also astroglial and oligodendroglial cells in the brain. BDV is associated with a large spectrum of neuropsychiatric pathologies in animals. Its relationship to human neuropsychiatric illness still remains controversial. We could recently demonstrate that human BDV strain Hu-H1 promoted apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation in a human oligodendroglial cell line (OL cells) whereas laboratory BDV strain V acted contrariwise. Here, differential protein expression between BDV Hu-H1-infected OL cells and non-infected OL cells was assessed through a proteomics approach, using two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 63 differential host proteins were identified in BDV Hu-H1-infected OL cells compared to non-infected OL cells. We found that most changes referred to alterations related to the pentose phosphate pathway, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and glycolysis /gluconeogenesis. By manual querying, two differential proteins were found to be associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction. Five key signaling proteins of this pathway (i.e., p-Raf, p-MEK, p-ERK1/2, p-RSK, and p-MSK) were selected for Western blotting validation. p-ERK1/2 and p-RSK were found to be significantly up-regulated, and p-MSK was found to be significantly down-regulated in BDV Hu-H1-infected OL cells compared to non-infected OL cell. Although BDV Hu-H1 constitutively activated the ERK–RSK pathway, host cell proliferation and nuclear translocation of activated pERK in BDV Hu-H1-infected OL cells were impaired. These findings indicate that BDV Hu-H1 infection of human oligodendroglial cells significantly perturbs host energy metabolism, activates the downstream ERK–RSK complex of the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade, and disturbs host cell proliferation possibly through impaired nuclear translocation of pERK, a finding which warrants further research.

AB  - Abstract
High-density, event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded to explore differences in spatiotemporal dynamics between modus ponens (MP) and modus tollens (MT) in the Wason selection task. Results showed that MP elicits a more positive P3b-like component than MT from 400 to 800 ms. MP appeared to occur earlier than MT in various stages of proposition testing, such as stimulus processing and response selection. ERP results showed that MT has a longer duration and more negative later negative component (LNC) than MP at 2000 ms. This result suggests that MT occupies more cognitive resources than MP in the final stages of proposition testing. The short and small left frontal LNC obtained by MP implies examination of the expectable conclusion, whereas the long and large left frontal LNC elicited by MT may be involved in the retention operation of the card in working memory from the monitoring and inspecting putative conclusion in the later stages of proposition testing.

AB  - Abstract
Previous studies have indicated a sparse distribution of multisensory neurons in the transition zones between cortical areas associated with specific sensory modalities. However, little is known about the distribution and functional properties of such neurons. The bimodal visual–auditory neurons in the transition area between visual and auditory cortices in rats were examined to determine whether these neurons are modulated by simultaneous input from visual and auditory modalities. Visual–auditory neurons were found to have a non-uniform distribution within this region, instead gathering together and forming a small zone. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that visual–auditory neurons possess integrative characteristics similar to neurons of the superior colliculus, a midbrain structure in the visual pathway. Exposing adult animals to combined visual and auditory stimuli resulted in an expansion of bimodal neuron distribution in the visual–auditory transition area. These effects were more pronounced in young animals; in this case, the distribution of visual–auditory neurons extended past the limits of the transition area and invaded the flanking modality-specific cortical areas. These results provide a direct demonstration of the role of sensory experience in shaping cortical structure, which can have implications for neuronal integration and cognitive function.

AB  - Abstract
Light has profound effects on mood, as exemplified by seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and the beneficial effects of bright light therapy. However, the underlying neural pathways through which light regulates mood are not well understood. Our previous work has developed the diurnal grass rat, Arvicanthis niloticus, as an animal model of SAD (Leach et al., 2013a,b). By utilizing a 12:12-h dim light:dark (DLD) paradigm that simulates the lower light intensity of winter, we showed that the animals housed in DLD exhibited increased depression-like behaviors in the forced swim test (FST) and sweet solution preference (SSP) compared to animals housed in bright light during the day (BLD). The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that light affects mood by acting on the brain orexinergic system in the diurnal grass rat model of SAD. First, orexin A immunoreactivity (OXA-ir) was examined in DLD and BLD grass rats. Results revealed a reduction in the number of OXA-ir neurons in the hypothalamus and attenuated OXA-ir fiber density in the dorsal raphe nucleus of animals in the DLD compared to those in the BLD group. Then, the animals in BLD were treated systemically with SB-334867, a selective orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) antagonist, which led to a depressive phenotype characterized by increased immobility in the FST and a decrease in SSP compared to vehicle-treated controls. Results suggest that attenuated orexinergic signaling is associated with increased depression-like behaviors in grass rats, and support the hypothesis that the orexinergic system mediates the effects of light on mood.

AB  - Abstract
Task execution almost always occurs in the context of reward-seeking or punishment-avoiding behavior. As such, ongoing task-monitoring systems are influenced by reward anticipation systems. In turn, when a task has been executed either successfully or unsuccessfully, future iterations of that task will be re-titrated on the basis of the task outcome. Here, we examined the neural underpinnings of the task-monitoring and reward-evaluation systems to better understand how they govern reward-seeking behavior. Twenty-three healthy adult participants performed a task where they accrued points that equated to real world value (gift cards) by responding as rapidly as possible within an allotted timeframe, while success rate was titrated online by changing the duration of the timeframe dependent on participant performance. Informative cues initiated each trial, indicating the probability of potential reward or loss (four levels from very low to very high). We manipulated feedback by first informing participants of task success/failure, after which a second feedback signal indicated actual magnitude of reward/loss. High-density electroencephalography (EEG) recordings allowed for examination of event-related potentials (ERPs) to the informative cues and in turn, to both feedback signals. Distinct ERP components associated with reward cues, task-preparatory and task-monitoring processes, and reward feedback processes were identified. Unsurprisingly, participants displayed increased ERP amplitudes associated with task-preparatory processes following cues that predicted higher chances of reward. They also rapidly updated reward and loss prediction information dependent on task performance after the first feedback signal. Finally, upon reward receipt, initial reward probability was no longer taken into account. Rather, ERP measures suggested that only the magnitude of actual reward or loss was now processed. Reward and task-monitoring processes are clearly dissociable, but interact across very fast timescales to update reward predictions as information about task success or failure is accrued. Careful delineation of these processes will be useful in future investigations in clinical groups where such processes are suspected of having gone awry.

AB  - Abstract
The interleukin (IL)-6 pathway plays an important role in recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI). The anti-IL-6 receptor antibody MR16-1 has been shown to suppress inflammation after SCI and promote recovery of motor function. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of MR16-1 on the expression patterns of phospholipids in the spinal cord in a mouse model of SCI. Eight-week-old C57BL/6JJmsSlc mice were used in this study. Laminectomy was performed at the ninth and tenth thoracic levels (T9–T10), and contusion injury of the spinal cord was induced at level T10. Immediately after SCI, mice were intraperitoneally injected with a single dose of MR16-1 (MR16-1 group) or a single dose of phosphate-buffered saline of the same volume (control group). Imaging mass spectrometry was performed to visualize phosphatidylcholine (PC) expression in the spinal cord 7 days after SCI. We found that MR16-1 treatment suppressed the infiltration of immune cells after SCI, and was able to increase the locomotor function post-injury. Phospholipid imaging revealed that the MR16-1 was able to prevent the reduction of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-containing PC in comparison with the control group. We also observed high levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) at the site of DHA-containing PC expression in the MR16-1 group. These results suggest that MR16-1 treatment influences the DHA-containing PC composition of GFAP-positive cells at the injury site as early as 7 days post-SCI.

AB  - Abstract
The auxiliary α2δ-1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels is up-regulated in dorsal root ganglion neurons following peripheral somatosensory nerve damage, in several animal models of neuropathic pain. The α2δ-1 protein has a mainly presynaptic localization, where it is associated with the calcium channels involved in neurotransmitter release. Relevant to the present study, α2δ-1 has been shown to be the therapeutic target of the gabapentinoid drugs in their alleviation of neuropathic pain. These drugs are also used in the treatment of certain epilepsies. In this study we therefore examined whether the level or distribution of α2δ-1 was altered in the hippocampus following experimental induction of epileptic seizures in rats, using both the kainic acid model of human temporal lobe epilepsy, in which status epilepticus is induced, and the tetanus toxin model in which status epilepticus is not involved. The main finding of this study is that we did not identify somatic overexpression of α2δ-1 in hippocampal neurons in either of the epilepsy models, unlike the upregulation of α2δ-1 that occurs following peripheral nerve damage to both somatosensory and motor neurons. However, we did observe local reorganization of α2δ-1 immunostaining in the hippocampus only in the kainic acid model, where it was associated with areas of neuronal cell loss, as indicated by absence of NeuN immunostaining, dendritic loss, as identified by areas where microtubule-associated protein-2 immunostaining was missing, and reactive gliosis, determined by regions of strong OX42 staining.

AB  - Abstract
Congenital toxoplasmosis and toxoplasmic encephalitis can be associated with severe neuropsychiatric symptoms. However, which host cell processes are regulated and how Toxoplasma gondii affects these changes remain unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA sequences critical to neurodevelopment and adult neuronal processes by coordinating the activity of multiple genes within biological networks. We examined the expression of over 1000 miRNAs in human neuroepithelioma cells in response to infection with Toxoplasma. MiR-132, a cyclic AMP-responsive element binding (CREB)-regulated miRNA, was the only miRNA that was substantially upregulated by all three prototype Toxoplasma strains. The increased expression of miR-132 was also documented in mice following infection with Toxoplasma. To identify cellular pathways regulated by miR-132, we performed target prediction followed by pathway enrichment analysis in the transcriptome of Toxoplasma-infected mice. This led us to identify 20 genes and dopamine receptor signaling was their strongest associated pathway. We then examined myriad aspects of the dopamine pathway in the striatum of Toxoplasma-infected mice 5 days after infection. Here we report decreased expression of D1-like dopamine receptors (DRD1, DRD5), metabolizing enzyme (MAOA) and intracellular proteins associated with the transduction of dopamine-mediated signaling (DARPP-32 phosphorylation at Thr34 and Ser97). Increased concentrations of dopamine and its metabolites, serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were documented by HPLC analysis; however, the metabolism of dopamine was decreased and 5-HT metabolism was unchanged. Our data show that miR-132 is upregulated following infection with Toxoplasma and is associated with changes in dopamine receptor signaling. Our findings provide a possible mechanism for how the parasite contributes to the neuropathology of infection.

AB  - Abstract
We previously demonstrated that mice which overexpress human renin and angiotensinogen (R+A+) show enhanced cerebral damage in both in vivo and in vitro experimental ischemia models. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) counteracts the effects of angiotensin (Ang-II) by transforming it into Ang-(1–7), thus reducing the ligand for the AT1 receptor and increasing stimulation of the Mas receptor. Triple transgenic mice, SARA, which specifically overexpress ACE2 in neurons of R+A+ mice were used to study the role of ACE2 in ischemic stroke using oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) of brain slices as an in vitro model. We examined tissue swelling, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cell death in the cerebral cortex (CX) and the hippocampal CA1 region during OGD. Expression levels of NADPH oxidase (Nox) isoforms, Nox2 and Nox4 were measured using western blots. Results show that SARA mice and R+A+ mice treated with the Mas receptor agonist Ang-(1–7) had less swelling, cell death, and ROS production in CX and CA1 areas compared to those in R+A+ animals. Treatment of slices from SARA mice with the Mas antagonist A779 eliminated this protection. Finally, western blots revealed less Nox2 and Nox4 expression in SARA mice compared with R+A+ mice both before and after OGD. We suggest that reduced brain swelling and cell death observed in SARA animals exposed to OGD result from diminished ROS production coupled with lower expression of Nox isoforms. Thus, the ACE2/Ang-(1–7)/Mas receptor pathway plays a protective role in brain ischemic damage by counteracting the detrimental effects of Ang-II-induced ROS production.

AB  - Abstract
The correlation between temporal changes of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and the severity of transient ischemic stroke in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar–Kyoto rats (WKY) was investigated using T2-, diffusion- and perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging at six different time points: before and during 1 h of unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), 1 h after reperfusion, and 1 day, 4 days and 7 days after MCAO. rCBF values were measured in both hemispheres, and the perfusion-deficient lesion (PDL) was defined as the area of the brain with a 57% or more reduction in basal CBF. Within the PDL, regions were further refined as ischemic core (rCBF = 0–6 mL/100 g/min), ischemic penumbra (rCBF = 6–15 mL/100 g/min) and benign oligemia (rCBF &gt; 15 mL/100 g/min). SHR and WKY had identical initial volume of the PDLs (WKY: 32.52 ± 4.08% vs. SHR: 33.95 ± 3.68%; P &gt; 0.05) and the maximum rCBF measured within those lesions (WKY: 38.20 ± 3.57 mL/100 g/min vs. SHR: 38.46 ± 6.22 mL/100 g/min; P &gt; 0.05) during MCAO. However, in SHR virtually all of the PDL progressed to become the final ischemic lesion (33.02 ± 5.41%, P &gt; 0.05), while the final ischemic lesion volume of WKY (12.62 ± 9.19%) was significantly smaller than their original PDL (P &lt; 0.01) and similar to the ischemic core (13.13 ± 2.96%, P &gt; 0.05). The region with the lowest range of rCBF was positively correlated with the final ischemic lesion volume (r = 0.716, P &lt; 0.01). Both during ischemia and after reperfusion, rCBF in either ipsilesional and contralesional brain hemispheres of SHR could not be restored to pre-ischemic levels, and remained lower than in WKY until up to 4 days after MCAO. The data suggest that impaired CBF regulation and relatively high CBF threshold for ischemia are strong contributors to the increased susceptibility of SHR to ischemic stroke.

AB  - AbstractBackground and object
Apoptosis is a major form of cell death in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) pathogenesis and may represent a target for treatment. Diosmin (DM), a micronized purified flavonoid drug, possesses an anti-apoptotic effect in the treatment of varicose veins and renal injury. However, the effect of DM in the acute phase of cerebral I/R is not clear. This study investigated DM’s role in cerebral I/R and its potential mechanism.
Methods
Male CD-1 mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Experiment 1 was used to evaluate the time course expression of Janus tyrosine kinase-2 (JAK2), signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), phosphorylated JAK2 (pJAK2) and phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) after cerebral I/R, and six time points were included. In experiment 2, DM was given orally at doses of 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg for 6 consecutive days before receiving tMCAO. At 24 h after reperfusion, neurological deficit, Nissl staining, brain water content and infarct volume were examined. Bcl-2, Bax, pJAK2, and pSTAT3 were detected by immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR and Western blot. Confocal microscope was used to observe the location of pSTAT3 in the cerebral cortex.
Results
Compared with Vehicle group, the high dose of DM significantly alleviated neurological deficit, brain water content, infarct volume, increased the Nissl-positive cells, upregulated the expression of pJAK2, pSTAT3 and Bcl-2 and downregulated Bax (P &lt; 0.05).
Conclusion
These results showed that DM protected against cerebral I/R injury through activating JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway.

AB  - Abstract
Traumatic spinal cord injury induces a long-standing inflammatory response in the spinal cord tissue, leading to a progressive apoptotic death of spinal cord neurons and glial cells. We have recently demonstrated that immediate treatment with the antioxidants N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) and acetyl-l-carnitine (ALC) attenuates neuroinflammation, induces axonal sprouting, and reduces the death of motoneurons in the vicinity of the trauma zone 4 weeks after initial trauma. The objective of the current study was to investigate the effects of long-term antioxidant treatment on the survival of descending rubrospinal neurons after spinal cord injury in rats. It also examines the short- and long-term effects of treatment on apoptosis, inflammation, and regeneration in the spinal cord trauma zone. Spinal cord hemisection performed at the level C3 induced a significant loss of rubrospinal neurons 8 weeks after injury. At 2 weeks, an increase in the expression of the apoptosis-associated markers BCL-2-associated X protein (BAX) and caspase 3, as well as the microglial cell markers OX42 and ectodermal dysplasia 1 (ED1), was seen in the trauma zone. After 8 weeks, an increase in immunostaining for OX42 and the serotonin marker 5HT was detected in the same area. Antioxidant therapy reduced the loss of rubrospinal neurons by approximately 50%. Treatment also decreased the expression of BAX, caspase 3, OX42 and ED1 after 2 weeks. After 8 weeks, treatment decreased immunoreactivity for OX42, whereas it was increased for 5HT. In conclusion, this study provides further insight in the effects of treatment with NAC and ALC on descending pathways, as well as short- and long-term effects on the spinal cord trauma zone.

AB  - Abstract
Sensitization and activation of trigeminal nociceptors is implicated in prevalent and debilitating orofacial pain conditions including temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders. Orexins are excitatory neuropeptides that function to regulate many physiological processes and are reported to modulate nociception. To determine the role of orexins in an inflammatory model of trigeminal activation, the effects of a dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA-12) on levels of proteins that promote peripheral and central sensitization and changes in nocifensive responses were investigated. In adult male Sprague–Dawley rats, mRNA for orexin receptor 1 (OX1R) and receptor 2 (OX2R) were detected in trigeminal ganglia and spinal trigeminal nucleus (STN). OX1R immunoreactivity was localized primarily in neuronal cell bodies in the V3 region of the ganglion and in laminas I–II of the STN. Animals injected bilaterally with complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) in the TMJ capsule exhibited increased expression of P-p38, P-ERK, and lba1 in trigeminal ganglia and P-ERK and lba1 in the STN at 2 days post injection. However, levels of each of these proteins in rats receiving daily oral DORA-12 were inhibited to near basal levels. Similarly, administration of DORA-12 on days 3 and 4 post CFA injection in the TMJ effectively inhibited the prolonged stimulated expression of protein kinase A, NFkB, and Iba1 in the STN on day 5 post injection. While injection of CFA mediated a nocifensive response to mechanical stimulation of the orofacial region at 2 h and 3 and 5 days post injection, treatment with DORA-12 suppressed the nocifensive response on day 5. Somewhat surprisingly, nocifensive responses were again observed on day 10 post CFA stimulation in the absence of daily DORA-12 administration. Our results provide evidence that DORA-12 can inhibit CFA-induced stimulation of trigeminal sensory neurons by inhibiting expression of proteins associated with sensitization of peripheral and central neurons and nociception.

AB  - Abstract
β-Site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE1) is the rate-limiting enzyme for production of Aβ peptides, proposed to drive the pathological changes found in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Reticulon 3 (RTN3) is a negative modulator of BACE1 (β-secretase) proteolytic activity, while peptidylprolyl isomerase (cyclophilin)-like 2 (PPIL2) positively regulated BACE1 gene expression in a cell-based assay. This study aimed to analyze RTN3 and PPIL2 mRNA levels in four brain regions from individuals with AD and controls. BACE1 mRNA had been previously quantified in the samples, as had glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE), to track changing cell populations in the tissue. mRNA levels in the human post mortem brain tissue were assayed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and qbasePLUS, employing validated stably expressed reference genes. No differences in RTN3 or PPIL2 mRNA levels were found in individuals with AD, compared to controls. Both RTN3 and PPIL2 mRNA levels correlated significantly with BACE1 mRNA and all three showed similar disease stage-dependent changes with respect to NSE and GFAP. These findings indicated that the in vitro data demonstrating an effect of PPIL2 on BACE1 expression have functional relevance in vivo. Further research into BACE1-interacting proteins could provide a fruitful approach to the modulation of this protease and consequently Aβ production.

AB  - Abstract
Targeting cortical neuroplasticity through rehabilitation-based practice is believed to enhance functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI). While prehensile performance is severely disturbed after C6–C7 SCI, subjects with tetraplegia can learn a compensatory passive prehension using the tenodesis effect. During tenodesis, an active wrist extension triggers a passive flexion of the fingers allowing grasping. We investigated whether motor imagery training could promote activity-dependent neuroplasticity and improve prehensile tenodesis performance. SCI participants (n = 6) and healthy participants (HP, n = 6) took part in a repeated measurement design. After an extended baseline period of 3 weeks including repeated magnetoencephalography (MEG) measurements, MI training was embedded within the classical course of physiotherapy for 5 additional weeks (three sessions per week). An immediate MEG post-test and a follow-up at 2 months were performed. Before MI training, compensatory activations and recruitment of deafferented cortical regions characterized the cortical activity during actual and imagined prehension in SCI participants. After MI training, MEG data yielded reduced compensatory activations. Cortical recruitment became similar to that in HP. Behavioral analysis evidenced decreased movement variability suggesting motor learning of tenodesis. Data suggest that MI training participated to reverse compensatory neuroplasticity in SCI participants, and promoted the integration of new upper limb prehensile coordination in the neural networks functionally dedicated to the control of healthy prehension before injury.

AB  - Abstract
Parkinson’s disease patients who suffer from freezing of gait (PD-FOG) may have sensory and/or perceptual deficits, although they are difficult to disentangle. This study evaluated whether visuospatial perception or self-motion perception were more impaired in PD-FOG, and whether distance estimation errors might be related to misperception of physical walking (compared to imagined). Finally, cognitive status was evaluated in order to evaluate whether cognitive status predicts any of the perception deficits identified. Nine PD-FOG and 15 PD-nonFOG were tested. In experiment 1, participants were shown a target, then the target was removed, before participants demonstrated the original position of the target in two different feedback conditions (pointing with a laser, or walking to its original position). In experiment 2, participants walked to a target (3, 4.5, 6 m) and then imagined walking to that same target. The time to complete both of these tasks was measured and compared. Experiment 1 found a significantly greater judgment error in PD-FOG across both conditions (p = 0.013) (compared to PD-nonFOG). Constant error revealed that both groups significantly underestimated during the self-motion condition only (p = 0.01). Interestingly, results from experiment 2 demonstrated a significant discrepancy between the time it took to imagine walking compared to their actual movement times, specifically in PD-FOG (p = 0.03). This mismatch as well as cognitive status significantly predicted judgment errors during the self-motion condition from experiment 1. Therefore, this study found evidence that PD-FOG have significantly greater sensory–perception deficits compared to PD-nonFOG. These findings have important clinical implications for further understanding FOG and developing new rehabilitative strategies for FOG symptoms.

AB  - Abstract
Some pathophysiological models of schizophrenia posit that prenatal inflammation sensitizes the developing brain to second insults in early life and enhances brain vulnerability, thereby increasing the risk of developing the disorder during adulthood. We previously developed a two-hit animal model, based on the well-established prenatal immune challenge with poly-inosinic/cytidylic acid (polyI:C), followed by juvenile restraint stress (RS). We observed an additive disruption of prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle in juvenile mice submitted to both insults. Previous studies have also reported that oxidative stress is associated with pathophysiological mechanisms of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. We report here that PPI disruption in our two-hit animal model of schizophrenia is associated with an increase in oxidative stress. These findings led us to assess whether α-lipoic acid, an antioxidant, can prevent both increase in oxidative status and PPI deficits in our juvenile in vivo model of schizophrenia. In the offspring submitted to prenatal injection of polyI:C and to RS, treatment with α-lipoic acid prevented the development of PPI deficits 24 h after the last period of RS. α-Lipoic acid also improved PPI performance in control mice. The reversal effect of α-lipoic acid pretreatment on these behavioral alterations was further accompanied by a normalization of the associated oxidative status and dopaminergic and GABAergic abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex. Based on our double insult paradigm, these results support the hypothesis that oxidative stress plays an important role in the development of PPI deficits, a well-known behavior associated with schizophrenia. These findings form the basis of future studies aiming to unravel mechanistic insights of the putative role of antioxidants in the treatment of schizophrenia, especially during the prodromal stage.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic exposure to n-hexane induces peripheral-central axonopathy, mediated by its metabolite 2,5-hexanedione (2,5-HD), in occupational workers and experimental animals, but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In the current study, we investigated the effects of 2,5-HD on middle-molecular-weight neurofilament (NF-M) axonal transport using live-cell imaging technique in cultured rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cells. PA-GFP-NF-M plasmid was transfected into DRG neurons and live-cell imaging was performed to observe the slow axonal transport of NF-M. The levels of cytoskeleton and motor proteins in DRG cells were detected by Western-blot and the concentration of ATP was determined using an ATP Assay Kit. The results showed that 2,5-HD administration resulted in a decrease of NF-M axonal transport and a reduction of three neurofilament subunits levels in DRG cells. Furthermore, 2,5-HD exposure significantly decreased ATP contents and the protein levels of kinesin heavy chain (KHC). These findings indicated that 2,5-HD reduced slow axonal transport, neurofilaments cargoes, motor proteins and ATP energy in rat DRG cells, which may contribute to 2,5-HD-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - Abstract
Head direction (HD) cells have been identified in a number of limbic system structures. These cells encode the animal’s perceived directional heading in the horizontal plane and are dependent on an intact vestibular system. Previous studies have reported that the responses of vestibular neurons within the vestibular nuclei are markedly attenuated when an animal makes a volitional head turn compared to passive rotation. This finding presents a conundrum in that if vestibular responses are suppressed during an active head turn how is a vestibular signal propagated forward to drive and update the HD signal? This review identifies and discusses four possible mechanisms that could resolve this problem. These mechanisms are: (1) the ascending vestibular signal is generated by more than just vestibular-only neurons, (2) not all vestibular-only neurons contributing to the HD pathway have firing rates that are attenuated by active head turns, (3) the ascending pathway may be spared from the affects of the attenuation in that the HD system receives information from other vestibular brainstem sites that do not include vestibular-only cells, and (4) the ascending signal is affected by the inhibited vestibular signal during an active head turn, but the HD circuit compensates and uses the altered signal to accurately update the current HD. Future studies will be needed to decipher which of these possibilities is correct.

The left occipitotemporal cortex has been found sensitive to the hierarchy of increasingly complex features in visually presented words, from individual letters to bigrams and morphemes. However, whether this sensitivity is a stable property of the brain regions engaged by word recognition is still unclear. To address the issue, the current study investigated whether different task demands modify this sensitivity. Participants viewed real English words and stimuli with hierarchical word-likeness while performing a lexical decision task (i.e., to decide whether each presented stimulus is a real word) and a symbol detection task. General linear model and independent component analysis indicated strong activation in the fronto-parietal and temporal regions during the two tasks. Furthermore, the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus and insula showed significant interaction effects between task demand and stimulus type in the pseudoword condition. The occipitotemporal cortex showed strong main effects for task demand and stimulus type, but no sensitivity to the hierarchical word-likeness was found. These results suggest that different task demands on semantic, phonological and orthographic processes can influence the involvement of the relevant regions during visual word recognition.

AB  - Abstract
Type A behavior pattern (TABP) is characterized by competitiveness and hostility, time urgency and impatience. These traits can have a significant impact on physical and mental health. We have not found studies focusing on brain structure or functional connectivity correlates associated with individual differences in TABP. The present study used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis to examine the neural correlates of TABP. The results showed that TABP was positively correlated with regional gray matter volume (rGMV) in the left subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC), which might reflect immature functioning of this region related to impatience. In addition, TABP was positively correlated with the strength of rsFC between the left ventral striatum and areas in the left ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the right rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC). These regions are associated with achievement striving related to impatience, aggressiveness, and worry under time pressure. In summary, the combination of morphometric results (increased rGMV of the left sgACC) and functional connectivity findings (increased rsFC between the left ventral caudate and the left vmPFC/right rACC in the fronto-striatal network) may provide a valuable basis for a comprehensive understanding of the neural circuitry underlying individual differences in TABP.

AB  - Abstract
Rivastigmine is a non-competitive inhibitor of both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butylcholinesterase (BuChE) used to treat mild to moderate dementia in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. Although rivastigmine reportedly ameliorates cognitive dysfunction in these patients, its ability to improve Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) remains unclear. To determine whether rivastigmine treatment antagonizes depression-like behaviors, we chronically administered rivastigmine (0.1–1.0 mg/kg) to olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) mice once a day for 2 weeks, starting 2 weeks after bulbectomy. Chronic treatment at 0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg dose dependently and significantly improved depression-like behaviors, as assessed by tail suspension (TST), forced swim (FST), locomotion and novelty-suppressed feeding (NSFT) tests. Importantly, co-administration with WAY-100635 (1.0 mg/kg), a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, but not ketanserin (1.0 mg/kg,), a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, completely blocked rivastigmine-induced anti-depressive effects, suggesting that 5-HT1A receptor stimulation mediates this activity. Consistent with this observation, rivastigmine treatment significantly rescued impaired neurogenesis observed in OBX mice in a 5-HT1A receptor-dependent manner. Furthermore, enhanced protein kinase B (Akt) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation seen following rivastigmine treatment was closely associated with improved neurogenesis. These effects were blocked by WAY-100635 but not ketanserin treatment. Finally, we confirmed that 5-HT1A but not 5-HT2A receptor stimulation by specific agonists mimicked rivastigmine-induced anti-depression activity and promoted hippocampal neurogenesis. We conclude that, in addition to enhancing the cholinergic system, rivastigmine treatment restores normal function of the hippocampal serotonergic system, an activity that likely ameliorates depressive behaviors in AD patients.

AB  - Abstract
We used FM imaging to identify neurons that receive sensory feedback from the body wall in a circuit for octopamine (OA)-evoked rhythmic locomotion in the earthworm, Eisenia fetida. We visualized synapses in which postsynaptic neurons receive the sensory feedback, by using FM1-43 dye to label the synapses of both motor and sensory pathways that are associated with locomotion, then clearing the motor pathway synapse labeling, and finally identifying the target synapses by distinguishing physiologically functional synapses through destaining using a high-K+ solution. A pair of synaptic regions associated with the sensory feedback was found to be located two or three cell body-widths away from the midline, between the anterior parts of the roots of the second lateral nerves (LNs) at the segmental ganglia (SGs). Using conventional intracellular recording and dye loading of the cell bodies surrounding these synaptic regions, we identified a pair of bilateral neurons with cell bodies larger than those of other cells in these regions, and named them “Oscillatory firing neurons Projecting to Peripheral nerves” (OPPs). These had a bipolar shape and projected neurites to the ipsilateral first and third LNs, fired rhythmically, and had a burst timing synchronized with the motor pattern bursts from the ipsilateral first LNs. Current injection into an OPP caused firing in the ipsilateral first LNs, supporting the hypothesis that OPPs functionally project to the peripheral nerves. OPPs also sent neurites to the adjacent anterior and posterior SGs, suggesting connections with the adjacent segments. We conclude that FM imaging can be used to identify neurons involved in specific functions, and that OPPs are the first neurons to be associated with OA-induced locomotion in the earthworm.

AB  - Abstract
We tested the hypothesis that decreasing the control level of O2 from 95% to 40% reduces tissue partial pressure of oxygen (pO2), decreases extracellular nitric oxide (NO) and decreases intracellular superoxide (O2−) while maintaining viability in caudal solitary complex (cSC) neurons in slices (∼300–400 μm; neonatal rat P2–22; 34–37 °C). We also tested the hypothesis that normobaric hyperoxia is a general stimulant of cSC neurons, including CO2-excited neurons. Whole-cell recordings of cSC neurons maintained in 40% O2 were comparable to recordings made in 95% O2 in duration and quality. In 40% O2, cSC neurons had a significantly lower spontaneous firing rate but similar membrane potentials and input resistances as cSC neurons maintained in 95% O2. Tissue pO2 was threefold lower in 40% O2 versus 95% O2. Likewise, extracellular NO and intracellular O2− were lower in 40% versus 95% O2. 67% of neurons maintained in 40% O2 control were stimulated by hyperoxia (95% O2) compared to 81% of neurons maintained in 95% O2 that were stimulated during hyperoxic reoxygenation following acute exposure to 0–40% O2. cSC slices maintained in 40% O2 exhibited CO2-chemosensitive neurons, including CO2-excited (31.5%) and a higher incidence of CO2-inhibited (31.5%) neurons than previously reported. Likewise, a higher incidence of CO2-inhibited and lower incidence of CO2-excited neurons were observed in 85–95% O2. 82% of O2-excited neurons were also CO2-chemosensitive; CO2-excited (86%) and CO2-inhibited neurons (84%) were equally stimulated by hyperoxia. Our findings demonstrate that chronic (hours) and acute (minutes) exposure to hyperoxia stimulates firing rate in the majority of cSC neurons, most of which are also CO2 chemosensitive. Our findings support the hypothesis that recurring exposures to acute hyperoxia and hyperoxic reoxygenation—a repeating surge in tissue pO2—activate redox and nitrosative signaling mechanisms in CO2-chemosensitive neurons that alter expression of CO2 chemosensitivity (e.g., increased expression of CO2-inhibition) compared to sustained hyperoxia (85–95% O2).

AB  - Abstract
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons in the motor cortex, brain stem and spinal cord. Currently, there is no cure for this lethal disease. Although the mechanism underlying neuronal cell death in ALS remains elusive, growing evidence supports a crucial role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the pathogenesis of ALS. Recent reports show that guanabenz, a novel inhibitor of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) dephosphorylation, possesses anti-prion properties, attenuates ER stress and reduces paralysis and neurodegeneration in mTDP-43 Caenorhabditis elegans and Danio rerio models of ALS. However, the therapeutic potential of guanabenz for the treatment of ALS has not yet been assessed in a mouse model of ALS. In the present study, guanabenz was administered to a widely used mouse model of ALS expressing copper zinc superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) with a glycine to alanine mutation at position 93 (G93A). The results showed that the administration of guanabenz significantly extended the lifespan, delayed the onset of disease symptoms, improved motor performance and attenuated motor neuron loss in female SOD1 G93A mice. Moreover, western blotting results revealed that guanabenz dramatically increased the levels of phosphorylated-eIF2α (P-eIF2α) protein, without affecting total eIF2α protein levels. The results also revealed a significant decrease in the levels of the ER chaperone glucose-regulated protein 78 (BiP/Grp78) and markers of another two ER stress pathways, activating transcription factor 6α (ATF6α) and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1). In addition, guanabenz increased the protein levels of anti-apoptotic B cell lymphoma/lewkmia-2 (Bcl-2), and down-regulated the pro-apoptotic protein levels of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX) and cytochrome C in SOD1 G93A mice. Our findings indicate that guanabenz may represent a novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment of ALS, a lethal human disease with an underlying mechanism involving the attenuation of ER stress and mitochondrial stress via prolonging eIF2α phosphorylation.

AB  - Abstract
Dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) serotonin (5-HT) neurons play an important role in feeding, mood control and stress responses. One important feature of their activity across the sleep–wake cycle is their reduced firing during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep which stands in stark contrast to the wake/REM-on discharge pattern of brainstem cholinergic neurons. A prominent model of REM sleep control posits a reciprocal interaction between these cell groups. 5-HT inhibits cholinergic neurons, and activation of nicotinic receptors can excite DRN 5-HT neurons but the cholinergic effect on inhibitory inputs is incompletely understood. Here, in vitro, in DRN brain slices prepared from GAD67-GFP knock-in mice, a brief (3 min) bath application of carbachol (50 μM) increased the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in GFP-negative, putative 5-HT neurons but did not affect miniature (tetrodotoxin-insensitive) IPSCs. Carbachol had no direct postsynaptic effect. Thus, carbachol likely increases the activity of local GABAergic neurons which synapse on 5-HT neurons. Removal of dorsal regions of the slice including the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) region where GABAergic neurons projecting to the DRN have been identified, abolished the effect of carbachol on sIPSCs whereas the removal of ventral regions containing the oral region of the pontine reticular nucleus (PnO) did not. In addition, carbachol directly excited GFP-positive, GABAergic vlPAG neurons. Antagonism of both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors completely abolished the effects of carbachol. We suggest cholinergic neurons inhibit DRN 5-HT neurons when acetylcholine levels are lower i.e. during quiet wakefulness and the beginning of REM sleep periods, in part via excitation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors located on local vlPAG and DRN GABAergic neurons. Higher firing rates or burst firing of cholinergic neurons associated with attentive wakefulness or phasic REM sleep periods leads to excitation of 5-HT neurons via the activation of nicotinic receptors located postsynaptically and presynaptically on excitatory afferents.

AB  - Abstract
Enkephalin (ENK) has been postulated to play important roles in modulating nociceptive transmission, and it has been proved that ENKergic neurons acted as a critical component of sensory circuit in the adult spinal cord. Revealing the developmental characteristics of spinal ENKergic neurons will be helpful for understanding the formation and alteration of the sensory circuit under pain status. However, the relationship between the embryonic birth date and the adult distribution of ENKergic neurons has remained largely unknown due to the difficulties in visualizing the ENKergic neurons clearly. Taking advantage of the preproenkephalin-green fluorescent protein (PPE-GFP) transgenic mice in identifying ENKergic neurons, we performed the current birth-dating study and examined the spinal ENKergic neurogenesis. The ENKergic neurons born on different developmental stages and their final location during adulthood were investigated by combining bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and GFP labeling. The spinal ENKergic neurogenesis was restricted at E9.5 to E14.5, and fitted in the same pattern of spinal neurogenesis. Further comparative analysis revealed that spinal ENKergic neurons underwent heterogeneous characteristics. Our study also indicated that the laminar arrangement of ENKergic neurons in the superficial spinal dorsal horn depended on the neurogenesis stages. Taken together, the present study suggested that the birth date of ENKergic neurons is one determinant for their arrangement and function.

AB  - Abstract
Vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B) has recently been shown to be a promising novel neuroprotective agent for several neurodegenerative conditions. In the current study we extended previous work on neuroprotective potential for Parkinson’s disease (PD) by testing an expanded dose range of VEGF-B (1 and 10 μg) and directly comparing both neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects of VEGF-B in progressive unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) PD models to a single dose of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF, 10 μg), that has been established by several groups as a standard in both preclinical PD models. In the amphetamine-induced rotational tests the treatment with 1 and 10 μg VEGF-B resulted in significantly improved motor function of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats compared to vehicle-treated 6-OHDA-lesioned rats in the neuroprotection paradigm. Both doses of VEGF-B caused an increase in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cell and fiber count in the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum in the neuroprotective experiment. The effect size was comparable to the effects seen with GDNF. In the neurorestoration paradigm, VEGF-B injection had no significant effect in either the behavioral or the immunohistochemical analyses, whereas GDNF injection significantly improved the amphetamine-induced rotational behavior and reduced TH-positive neuronal cell loss in the SN. We also present a strong positive correlation (p = 1.9e−50) of the expression of VEGF-B with nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes involved in fatty acid metabolism in rat midbrain, pointing to the mitochondria as a site of action of VEGF-B. GDNF showed a positive correlation with nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes that was not nearly as strong (p = 0.018). VEGF-B counteracted rotenone-induced reduction of (a) fatty acid transport protein 1 and 4 levels and (b) both Akt protein and phosphorylation levels in SH-SY5Y cells. We further verified VEGF-B expression in the human SN pars compacta of healthy controls and PD patients, in neuronal cells that show co-expression with neuromelanin. These results have demonstrated that VEGF-B has potential as a neuroprotective agent for PD therapy and should be further investigated.

AB  - Abstract
The cochlear nucleus (CN) and superior olivary complex are auditory brainstem centers with essential roles in encoding temporal features of vocalizations, localization of sound sources and descending modulation of the cochlea. Numerous neuronal populations, across a multitude of laboratory mammals, have been characterized within these brainstem centers based on cell body morphology, dendritic architecture, afferent/efferent connections and neurochemistry. However, scant details are available for these neuronal populations in humans. The objective of this study is to further characterize human auditory hindbrain nuclei and examine the axonal connections between these structures. To this end, we have used immunohistochemistry and morphometric techniques to characterize neuronal populations and axonal projections in the human brainstem. Herein, we provide evidence for calretinin immunoreactive neurons and synaptic boutons in the ventral CN, axons in the trapezoid body, peridendritic boutons in the medial superior olive and calyceal endings in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Further, we demonstrate that the majority of neurons in the human MNTB are calbindin and Kv3.1b immunoreactive and that perisomatic profiles in this nucleus are vesicular glutamate transporter and Rab3a positive, suggesting that such profiles are in fact synaptic terminals.

AB  - Abstract
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine/threonine kinase that functions as a cellular and whole organism energy sensor to regulate ATP-consuming (anabolic) and ATP-generating (catabolic) pathways. The heterotrimeric AMPK complex consists of a catalytic α-subunit, regulatory β-subunit, and an AMP/ATP-binding γ-subunit. Several alternate isoforms exist for each subunit (α1, α2, β1, β2, γ1, γ2 and γ3). However, little is known of the expression pattern or function of the individual catalytic complexes in regulating neuronal structure. In this study, we examined the role of AMPK subunits in differentiating hippocampal neurons. We found that during development, the expression of AMPK subunits increase and that activation of AMPK by energetic stress inhibits neuronal development at multiple stages, not only during axon outgrowth, but also during dendrite growth and arborization. The presence of a single functional AMPK catalytic complex was sufficient to mediate these inhibitory effects of energetic stress. Activation of AMPK mediates these effects by suppressing both the mTOR and Akt signaling pathways. These findings demonstrate that the energy-sensing AMPK pathway regulates neuronal structure in distinct regions of developing neurons at multiple stages of development.

AB  - Abstract
Physical exercises and motor skill learning have been shown to induce changes in regional brain morphology, this has been demonstrated for various activities and tasks. Also individuals with special skills show differences in regional brain morphology. This has been indicated for professional musicians, London taxi drivers, as well as for athletes like dancers, golfers and judokas. However little is known about whether sports with different metabolic profiles (aerobic vs. anaerobic) are associated with different patterns of altered brain morphology.

In this cross-sectional study we investigated two groups of high-performance athletes, one group performing sports that are thought to be mainly aerobic, and one group performing sports known to have intermittent phases of anaerobic metabolism. Using high-resolution structural imaging and voxel-based morphometry (VBM), we investigated a group of 26 male athletes consisting of 13 martial artists and 13 endurance athletes as well as a group of non-exercising men (n = 13).

VBM analyses revealed higher gray matter (GM) volumes in the supplementary motor area/dorsal premotor cortex (BA 6) in both athlete groups as compared to the control group. In addition, endurance athletes showed significantly higher GM volume in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), specifically in the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus, which was not seen in the martial arts group.

Our data suggest that high-performance sports are associated with changes in regional brain morphology in areas implicated in motor planning and motor learning. In addition high-level endurance sports seem to affect MTL structures, areas that have previously been shown to be modulated by aerobic exercise.

AB  - Abstract
In this study, we investigated the effect of neonatal olfactory bulbectomy (nOBX) on behavioral paradigms related to olfaction such as exploratory behavior, locomotor activity in a novel environment and social interaction. We also studied the effect of nOBX on the activity of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors during development. The behavioral effects of nOBX (postnatal day 7, PD7) were investigated in pre- (PD30) and post-pubertal (PD60) Wistar rats. NMDA receptor activity was measured with [125I]MK-801 in the brain regions associated with the olfactory circuitry. A significant increase in the novelty-induced locomotion was seen in the pre-pubertal nOBX rats. Although the locomotor effect was less marked than in pre-pubertal rats, the nOBX rats tested post-pubertally failed to habituate to the novel situation as quickly as the sham- and normal- controls. Pre-pubertally, the head-dipping behavior was enhanced in nOBX rats compared with sham-operated and normal controls, while normal exploratory behavior was observed between groups in adulthood. In contrast, social interaction was increased in post-pubertal animals that underwent nOBX. Both pre- and post-pubertal nOBX rats recovered olfaction. Interestingly, pre-pubertal rats showed a significant increase in the [125I]MK-801 binding in the piriform cortex, dorsal hippocampus, inner and outer layers of the frontal cortex and outer layer of the cingulate cortex. At post-pubertal age, no significant differences in [125I]MK-801 binding were observed between groups at any of the brain regions analyzed. These results suggest that nOBX produces pre-pubertal behavioral disturbances and NMDA receptor changes that are transitory with recovery of olfaction early in adulthood.

AB  - Abstract
The functional differentiation between regions of psoas major (PM) and quadratus lumborum (QL) may underlie a mechanical basis for recruitment of motor units across the muscle. These mechanically unique fascicle regions of these complex multifascicular muscles, PM and QL, are likely to be controlled independently by the central nervous system (CNS). Fine-wire electrodes recorded the electromyographic activity of the PM fascicles arising from the transverse process (PM-t) and vertebral body (PM-v) and the anterior (QL-a) and posterior (QL-p) layers of QL on the right side during a postural perturbation associated with rapid arm movements. The findings of this study indicate that the CNS coordinates the activity of specific regions of PM and QL independently as a component of the anticipatory postural adjustments that precedes the predictable challenge to the spine associated with limb movements. The spatial and temporal features of discrete activity of different regions within PM and QL matched their differing mechanical advantage predicted from their anatomy. These findings suggest that the CNS differentially activates individual regions within complex spine muscles to control the three-dimensional forces applied to the spine. The data also point to a sophisticated control of muscle activation that appears based on mechanical advantage.

AB  - Abstract
Human modalities play a vital role in the way the brain produces mental representations of the world around us. Although congenital blindness limits the understanding of the environment in some aspects, blind individuals may have other superior capabilities from long-term experience and neural plasticity. This study investigated the effects of congenital blindness on temporal and spectral neural encoding of speech at the subcortical level. The study included 26 congenitally blind individuals and 24 normal-sighted individuals with normal hearing. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) was recorded with both click and speech synthetic 40-ms /da/ stimuli. No significant difference was observed between the two groups in wave latencies or amplitudes of click ABR. Latencies of speech ABR D (p = 0.012) and O (p = 0.014) waves were significantly shorter in blind individuals than in normal-sighted individuals. Amplitudes of the A (p &lt; 0.001) and E (p = 0.001) speech ABR (sABR) waves were also significantly higher in blind subjects. Blind individuals had significantly better results for duration (p &lt; 0.001) amplitude (p = 0.015) and slope of the V–A complex (p = 0.004), signal-to-noise ratio (p &lt; 0.001), and amplitude of the stimulus fundamental frequency (F0) (p = 0.009), first formant (F1) (p &lt; 0.001) and higher-frequency region (HF) (p &lt; 0.001) ranges. Results indicate that congenitally blind subjects have improved hearing function in response to the /da/ syllable in both source and filter classes of sABR. It is possible that these subjects have enhanced neural representation of vocal cord vibrations and improved neural synchronization in temporal encoding of the onset and offset parts of speech stimuli at the brainstem level. This may result from the compensatory mechanism of neural reorganization in blind subjects influenced from top-down corticofugal connections with the auditory cortex.

It has unknown etiology characterized by the infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages into the brain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in lymphocytes and whole blood, as well as butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) and adenosine deaminase (ADA) activities in serum. We also checked the levels of nucleotides, nucleosides, biomarkers of inflammation such as cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and IL-10) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in serum from 29 patients with the relapsing-remitting form of MS (RRMS) and 29 healthy subjects as the control group. Results showed that AChE in lymphocytes and whole blood as well as BChE, and ADA activities in serum were significantly increased in RRMS patients when compared to the control group (P &lt; 0.05). In addition, we observed a decrease in ATP levels and a significant increase in the levels of ADP, AMP, adenosine and inosine in serum from RRMS patients in relation to the healthy subjects (P &lt; 0.05). Results also demonstrated an increase in the IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6 and CRP (P &lt; 0.05) and a significant decrease in the IL-10 (P &lt; 0.0001) in RRMS patients when compared to control. Our results suggest that alterations in the biomarkers of inflammation and hydrolysis of nucleotides and nucleosides may contribute to the understanding of the neurological dysfunction of RRMS patients.

AB  - Abstract
The endocannabinoid system is a modulatory system that has been strongly associated with the regulation of functions as learning and memory, pain perception and sensory physiology in many areas of the central nervous system. However, although a role in sensory processing has been demonstrated at the level of the thalamus, the influence of the endocannabinoid system on thalamic rhythms and oscillations has been less studied, despite the fact that such activities are significant characteristics of the thalamic state.

The present work aimed to characterize the role of anandamide (AEA) – one of the endogenous CB1 receptor agonists – and AM251 – a CB1 antagonist – in the modulation of burst firing and oscillatory activity present in the dLGN of the anesthetized rat. Administration of AEA (0.5 mg/kg iv) increased the number of bursts in the majority of the cells tested and induced the appearance of a slow delta-like (1.5 Hz) oscillatory activity. These effects were CB1-mediated, as demonstrated by the complete antagonism during the co-application of AM251 (0.5 mg/kg iv). Thus, by demonstrating that the AEA-mediated activation of CB1 receptors increases spontaneous bursting and oscillatory activity in the thalamus our study infers that endocannabinoids could have a role in processes controlling the sleep–wake cycle and level of arousal.

AB  - Abstract
This study has revealed direct projections from the dorsal peduncular cortex (DP) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPfC) to the trigeminal brainstem sensory nuclear complex and other lower brainstem areas in rats. We first examined the distribution of mPfC neurons projecting directly to the medullary dorsal horn (trigeminal subnucleus caudalis [Vc]) and trigeminal subnucleus oralis (Vo) which are known to receive direct projections from the lateral prefrontal cortex (insular cortex). After injections of the retrograde tracer Fluorogold (FG) into the rostro-dorsomedial part of laminae I/II of Vc (rdm-I/II-Vc), many neurons were labeled bilaterally (with an ipsilateral predominance) in the rostrocaudal middle level of DP (mid-DP) and not in other mPfC areas. After FG injections into the lateral and caudal parts of laminae I/II of Vc, or the Vo, no neurons were labeled in the mPfC. We then examined projections from the mid-DP by using the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextranamine (BDA). After BDA injections into the mid-DP, many axons and terminals were labeled bilaterally (with an ipsilateral predominance) in the rdm-I/II-Vc, periaqueductal gray and solitary tract nucleus, and ipsilaterally in the parabrachial nucleus and trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus. In addition, the connections of the mid-DP with the insular cortex were examined. Many BDA-labeled axons and terminals from the mid-DP were also found ipsilaterally in the caudalmost level of the granular and dysgranular insular cortex (GI/DI). After BDA injections into the caudalmost GI/DI, many axons and terminals were labeled ipsilaterally in the mid-DP. The projections from the mid-DP to the rdm-I/II-Vc and other brainstem nuclei suggest that mid-DP neurons may regulate intraoral and perioral sensory processing (including nociceptive processing) of rdm-I/II-Vc neurons directly or indirectly through the brainstem nuclei. The reciprocal connections between the mid-DP and caudalmost GI/DI suggest that this regulation may involve mid-DP interactions with the caudalmost GI/DI neurons.

AB  - Abstract
We recently indicated that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) enhances the excitability of small-diameter trigeminal ganglion (TRG) neurons projecting onto the trigeminal nucleus interpolaris/caudalis (Vi/Vc) transition zone via a paracrine mechanism following masetter muscle (MM) inflammation. The present study investigated whether modulation of voltage-gated potassium (K) channels by BDNF contributes to this hyperexcitability effect. To induce inflammation we injected complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) into the MM. The escape threshold from mechanical stimulation applied to skin above the inflamed MM was significantly lower than in naïve rats. TRG neurons innervating the site of inflammation were subsequently identified by fluorogold (FG) labeling, and microbeads (MB) were used to label neurons projecting specifically to the Vi/Vc region. BDNF significantly decreased the total, transient (IA), and sustained (IK) currents in FG-/MB-labeled small-diameter TRG neurons under voltage-clamp conditions in naïve and inflamed rats. The magnitude of inhibition of IA and IK currents by BDNF in FG-/MB-labeled TRG neurons was significantly greater in inflamed rats than in naïve rats, and BDNF inhibited IA to a significantly greater extent than IK. Furthermore, co-administration of K252a, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, abolished the suppression of IA and IK currents by BDNF. These results suggested that the inhibitory effects of BDNF on IA and IK currents in small-diameter TRG neurons projecting onto the Vi/Vc potentiate neuronal excitability, and in turn, contribute to MM inflammatory hyperalgesia. These findings support the development of voltage-gated K+ channel openers and tyrosine kinase inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of trigeminal inflammatory hyperalgesia.

AB  - Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a stable reactive oxygen species and potent neuromodulator of cellular and synaptic activity. Centrally, endogenous H2O2 is elevated during bouts of hypoxia–reoxygenation, a variety of disease states, and aging. The nucleus tractus solitarii (nTS) is the central termination site of visceral afferents for homeostatic reflexes and contributes to reflex alterations during these conditions. We determined the extent to which H2O2 modulates synaptic and membrane properties in nTS neurons in rat brainstem slices. Stimulation of the tractus solitarii (which contains the sensory afferent fibers) evoked synaptic currents that were not altered by 10–500 μM H2O2. However, 500 μM H2O2 modulated several intrinsic membrane properties of nTS neurons, including a decrease in input resistance (Ri), hyperpolarization of resting membrane potential (RMP) and action potential (AP) threshold (THR), and an initial reduction in AP discharge to depolarizing current. H2O2 increased conductance of barium-sensitive potassium currents, and block of these currents ablated H2O2-induced changes in RMP, Ri and AP discharge. Following washout of H2O2 AP discharge was enhanced due to depolarization of RMP and a partially maintained hyperpolarization of THR. Hyperexcitability persisted with repeated H2O2 exposure. H2O2 effects on RMP and THR were ablated by intracellular administration of the antioxidant catalase, which was immunohistochemically identified in neurons throughout the nTS. Thus, H2O2 initially reduces excitability of nTS neurons that is followed by sustained hyperexcitability, which may play a profound role in cardiorespiratory reflexes.

AB  - Abstract
Sex differences exist in the depressive disorder prevalence and response to treatment. Several studies suggest that females respond better than males to the action of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), suggesting that gonadal hormones modulate mood and the response to these drugs. Sexual steroid hormones exert organizational actions (perennial and on early development) and activational effects (transient and on differentiated tissues). The aim of this study was to analyze sex differences in the forced swim test (FST) in animals without treatment and after fluoxetine (FLX, 0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg). Initially, we compared male and female adult rats under control conditions or after altering their sexual differentiation process (at day 5 postnatally, PN, 60 μg of testosterone propionate to females and male castration to induce or preclude masculinization, respectively). To further analyze if the sex differences depend on organizational or activational steroid hormone action we tested the same animals before and after adult gonadectomy. To prevent variations depending upon the estrous cycle, control and masculinized females were tested in estrus. Control females showed lower immobility and required lower doses of FLX (5 mg/kg), to show an antidepressant-like effect, than males (10 mg/kg), even after adult gonadectomy. In control males adult orchidectomy prevented FLX’s action. Neonatally masculinized females exhibited analogous levels of immobility than control ones; before ovariectomy they responded to FLX similar to controls, but after the surgery they did not respond to fluoxetine. Neonatally orchidectomized males exhibited similar immobility values and response to FLX than control females. The findings suggest that the sex difference in despair depends on the hormones organizational effects and, in males, the response to FLX relies on organizational and activational actions.

AB  - Abstract
This study examined the age-related subsequent memory effect (SME) in perceptual and semantic encoding using event-related potentials (ERPs). Seventeen younger adults and 17 older adults studied a series of Chinese characters either perceptually (by inspecting orthographic components) or semantically (by determining whether the depicted object makes sounds). The two tasks had similar levels of difficulty. The participants made studied or unstudied judgments during the recognition phase. Younger adults performed better in both conditions, with significant SMEs detected in the time windows of P2, N3, P550, and late positive component (LPC). In the older group, SMEs were observed in the P2 and N3 latencies in both conditions but were only detected in the P550 in the semantic condition. Between-group analyses showed larger frontal and central SMEs in the younger sample in the LPC latency regardless of encoding type. Aging effect appears to be stronger on influencing perceptual than semantic encoding processes. The effects seem to be associated with a decline in updating and maintaining representations during perceptual encoding. The age-related decline in the encoding function may be due in part to changes in frontal lobe function.

AB  - Abstract
Cerebral activations during olfactory mental imagery are fairly well investigated in healthy participants but little attention has been given to olfactory imagery in patients with olfactory loss. To explore whether olfactory loss leads to deficits in olfactory imagery, neural responses using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and self-report measures were investigated in 16 participants with acquired olfactory loss and 19 control participants. Participants imagined both pleasant and unpleasant odors and their visual representations. Patients reported less vivid olfactory but not visual images than controls. Results from neuroimaging revealed that activation patterns differed between patients and controls. While the control group showed stronger activation in olfactory brain regions for unpleasant compared to pleasant odors, the patient group did not. Also, activation in critical areas for olfactory imagery was correlated with the duration of olfactory dysfunction, indicating that the longer the duration of dysfunction, the more the attentional resources were employed. This indicates that participants with olfactory loss have difficulties to perform olfactory imagery in the conventional way. Regular exposure to olfactory information may be necessary to maintain an olfactory imagery capacity.

AB  - Abstract
Depression is a common symptom in Parkinson’s disease (PD), but its pathophysiology remains unclear. Several lines of studies have revealed that the prelimbic (PrL) sub-region of the ventral medial prefrontal cortex and 5-HT1A receptors are involved in the regulation of depression. In this study, we examined whether complete unilateral lesions of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) using 6-hydroxydopamine in rats are able to induce depressive-like behaviors, the role of PrL 5-HT1A receptors in the regulation of these behaviors, and co-localization of 5-HT1A receptor and neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1-immunoreactive (EAAC1-ir) neurons in the PrL. The MFB lesions induced depressive-like responses as measured by the sucrose preference and forced swim tests when compared to sham-operated rats. The intra-PrL injection of 5HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (50, 100, and 500 ng/rat) increased sucrose consumption, and decreased immobility time in both sham-operated and the lesioned rats, indicating the induction of antidepressant effects. Furthermore, the intra-PrL injection of 5HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 (60, 120, and 240 ng/rat) showed a decrease in sucrose consumption, and an increase in immobility time, indicating the induction of depressive-like responses. However, the effective doses in the lesioned rats were higher than those in sham-operated rats, which attribute to down-regulation of 5-HT1A receptor expression on EAAC1-ir neurons in the PrL of the lesioned rats. These findings suggest that unilateral lesions of the MFB in rats may induce depressive-like behaviors, and 5-HT1A receptors of the PrL play an important role in the regulation of these behaviors.

AB  - Abstract
The mesolimbic/mesocortical dopaminergic pathway plays a pivotal role in the reward system. During the neonatal period the mother is the main source of rewarding stimuli. We have developed an experimental model in which rat pups learn a T-maze during the neonatal period (postnatal day (PND) 10–13) using contact with the mother as the reward. One group of animals is allowed contact with the mother (receipt of expected reward, RER) while the other was denied (denial of expected reward, DER). We determined the effects of these two early experiences in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the nucleus accumbens (nAc), the levels of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites [3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA)] by high-performance liquid chromatography and those of D1 and D2 receptors by autoradiographic in vitro binding both on PND 13 and in adulthood. On PND13, 2 h after the end of training, the RER experience resulted in higher DA, HVA and D1 receptor levels in the nAc, while the DER in lower DA and its metabolites (DOPAC and HVA) in the PFC. These results could be related to the reward the RER pups received through the contact with their mother. The RER and DER early experience had long-term sex-dependent effects: The RER-induced activation of the dopaminergic system in the nAc was also evident in adult female rats. In contrast, adult DER males, similar to PND13 animals, had reduced dopamine in the PFC. Our results document that early experiences, a key determinant of adult brain function, affect the dopaminergic system which is disturbed in many psychiatric diseases.

AB  - Abstract
Hibernation is a physiological state that by putting vital biological processes at rest enables mammals to protect all organs, especially the brain against ischemic insults and reperfusion injuries. Earlier studies have highlighted the role of hypothalamic (HTH) sites like the periventricular nucleus (Pe) toward sleep-wake and cardiovascular activities of hibernators. In the present work, infusions of Pe with the orexigenic neuropeptide orexin-A (ORX-A) or the novel anti-obesity sympathoinhibitory neuroactive peptide catestatin (CST) have been correlated to differing feeding and motor behaviors in the facultative hibernating hamster Mesocricetus auratus. Behavioral observations showed that treatment with CST provided an anti-obesity activity via the reduction of food intake and body weight for all hibernating states, while ORX-A promoted orexigenic events during mainly the entrance phase. Moreover, hamsters treated with this neuropeptide during the entrance and the arousal hypertensive phases also featured elevated ORX 2 receptor (ORX2R) levels in the third layer of the parietal cortex and lateral HTH (LH), areas involved with feeding, motor plus sleep-wake rhythms. Conversely, ORX-A down-regulated ORX2Rs in the ventromedial (VMH) and supraoptic (SO) HTH nuclei that are associated with anorexigenic effects. Even CST induced mixed ORX2R expression patterns in mostly HTH areas like the evident down-regulation in LH along with the up-regulation in VMH and SO. Overall treatments, especially ORX-A + CST led to reduced neurodegenerative phenomena in HTH supporting their importance together with ORX2Rs in preserving hemodynamic activities, feeding and sleep-wake rhythms of this diencephalic station, which may supply useful therapeutic indications for treating cardiovascular disturbances linked with brain dysfunctions.

Toll-like receptor 11 (TLR11) is a specific receptor for Toxoplasma gondii and uropathogenic Escherichia coli and has recently been identified in the mouse brain. In the present study, TLR11 gene expression was measured in the mouse brain by Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Furthermore, the TLR11 protein expression profile was evaluated in neuroglia and neurons throughout the encephalitic period (10, 20, and 30 days after inoculation) in mice with experimentally induced T. gondii infection. In the brains of experimental (n = 21) and control (n = 7) mice, TLR11, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), cd11b, NeuN, TLR11/GFAP+, TLR11/cd11b+, and TLR11/NeuN+ cells were investigated using either indirect single- or double-labeling immunoperoxidase staining. The results indicated that TLR11 gene expression increased during chronic toxoplasmic encephalitis, and there was a variable degree of TLR11 immunopositivity among cd11b+, GFAP+, and NeuN+ cells in the brain. On the tenth day of infection, there was a significant increase in TLR11 protein and gene expression, which remained stable during the later stages of infection. In this experimental model, TLR11 expression was induced in astrocytes, neurons, and microglia/macrophages during the immune response to T. gondii infection.

AB  - Abstract
As a consequence of an ischemic episode, energy production is disturbed, leading to neuronal cell death. Despite intensive research, the quest for promising neuroprotective drugs has largely failed, not only because of ineffectiveness, but also because of serious side-effects and dosing difficulties. Acetyl-l-carnitine (ALC) is an essential nutrient which plays a key role in energy metabolism by transporting fatty acids into mitochondria for β-oxidation. It is an endogenous compound and can be used at high dose without toxicity in research into ischemia. Its neuroprotective properties have been reported in many studies, but its potential action on long-term potentiation (LTP) and dendritic spine density has not been described to date. The aim of the present study was an evaluation of the possible protective effect of ALC after ischemic insults inflicted on hippocampal synaptic plasticity in a 2-vessel occlusion (2VO) model in rats. For electrophysiological measurements, LTP was tested on hippocampal slices. The Golgi-Cox staining technique was used to determine spine density. 2VO resulted in a decreased, unstable LTP and a significant loss of dendritic spines. ALC administered after 2VO was not protective, but as pretreatment prior to 2VO it restored LTP nearly to the control level. This finding paralleled the histological analysis: ALC pretreatment resulted in the reappearance of dendritic spines on the CA1 pyramidal cells. Our data demonstrate that ALC administration can restore hippocampal function and spine density. ALC probably acts by enhancing the aerobic metabolic pathway, which is inhibited during and following ischemic attacks.

AB  - Abstract
Rewiring the injured corticospinal tract (CST) by promoting connections between CST axons and spared neurons is a strategy being explored experimentally to achieve improved recovery of motor function after spinal cord injury (SCI). Reliable interventions to promote and direct growth of collaterals from injured CST axons are in high demand to promote functionally relevant detour pathways. A promising tool is neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), which has shown growth-stimulating and chemo-attractive effects for spared CST axons caudal to a CST lesion. Yet, efforts to promote growth of injured CST axons rostral to a SCI with NT-3 have been less successful to date. Evidence indicates that immune activation in the local growth environment, either intrinsic or induced by the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), can play a decisive role in the CST’s responsiveness to NT-3. Here, we test the potential of NT-3 as a tool to enhance and direct collateral growth from the injured CST rostral to a SCI (1) using long-term expression of NT-3 by adeno-associated viral vectors, (2) with and without stimulating the immune system with LPS. Our results indicate that inducing a growth response from injured CST axons into a region of vector-mediated NT-3 expression is possible in the environment of the spinal cord rostral to a SCI, but seems dependent on the distance between the responding axon and the source of NT-3. Our findings also suggest that injured CST axons do not increase their growth response to NT-3 after immune activation with LPS in this environment. In conclusion, this is to our knowledge the first demonstration that NT-3 can be effective at promoting growth of injured CST collaterals far rostral to a SCI. Making NT-3 available in close proximity to CST target axons may be the key to success when using NT-3 to rewire the injured CST in future investigations.

AB  - Abstract
Although extensively investigated in socio-cognitive neuroscience, empathy is difficult to study. The first difficulty originates in its multifaceted nature. According to the multidimensional model, empathy combines emotional, automatic (simulation), cognitive (mentalizing) and regulatory (executive functions) processes. Substantial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data demonstrated that co-activations in the mirror neuron system (MNS) and mentalizing network (MENT) sustain this co-recruitment of so-called first- and second-person-like processes. Because of the poor temporal resolution of fMRI techniques, we currently lack evidence about the precise timing of the MNS–MENT combination. An important challenge is, thus, to disentangle how MNS and MENT dynamically work together along time in empathy. Moreover, the role of the executive functions in the MNS–MENT combination time course is still unknown. Second, empathy – feeling into – is closely related to sympathy – feeling with – and both phenomena are often conflated in experimental studies on intersubjectivity. In this electrical neuroimaging (EEG) pilot-study, we tested whether the egocentered vs. heterocentered visuo-spatial mechanisms respectively associated with sympathy and empathy differentially modulate the dynamic combination of the MNS–MENT activations in their respective neural time course. For that, we employed our newly developed behavioral paradigm assessing the visuo-spatial – but not emotional – features of empathy and sympathy. Using a data-driven approach, we report that empathy and sympathy are underlied by sequential activations in the MNS from the insula to the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) between 63 ms and 424 ms. However, at 333–424 ms, empathy triggered greater co-activations in the right IFG and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) (executive functions). Linking together our present and prior (Thirioux et al., 2010) findings from the same dataset, we suggest that this greater recruitment of the right dlPFC monitors the shift from egocentered and first-person-like mechanisms in the MNS to heterocentered and second-person-like mechanisms in the left temporo-parietal junction within the MENT, i.e., reflecting the onset of perspective-change processes in the neural time course of empathy. Contrasting with sympathy, this recruitment of the executive functions could modulate the output end of the mirroring processing in the premotor and sensorimotor cortices.

AB  - Abstract
The islet-antigens IA-2 and IA-2β are major autoantigens in type-1 diabetes and transmembrane proteins in dense core vesicles (DCV). Recently we showed that deletion of both IA-2 and IA-2β alters the secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters and impairs behavior and learning. The present study was designed to evaluate the contribution to learning of each of these genes by using single knockout (SKO) and double knockout (DKO) mice in an active avoidance test. After 5 days of training, wild-type (WT) mice showed 60–70% active avoidance responses, whereas the DKO mice showed only 10–15% active avoidance responses. The degree of active avoidance responses in the IA-2 SKO mice was similar to that of the DKO mice, but in contrast, the IA-2β SKO mice behaved like WT mice showing 60–70% active avoidance responses. Molecular studies revealed a marked decrease in the phosphorylation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII) in the striatum and hippocampus of the IA-2 SKO and DKO mice, but not in the IA-2β SKO mice. To evaluate the role of CREB and CAMKII in the SKO and DKO mice, GBR-12909, which selectively blocks the dopamine uptake transporter and increases CREB and CAMKII phosphorylation, was administered. GBR-12909 restored the phosphorylation of CREB and CAMKII and increased active avoidance learning in the DKO and IA-2 SKO to near the normal levels found in the WT and IA-2β SKO mice. We conclude that in the absence of the DCV protein IA-2, active avoidance learning is impaired.

AB  - Abstract
Shape perception can be achieved based on various cues such as luminance, color, texture, depth and motion. To investigate common neural mechanisms underlying shape perception cued by various visual attributes, we examined single-neuron activity in the monkey anterior superior temporal sulcus (STS) in response to shapes defined by luminance and motion cues during shape discrimination. We found cortical mapping with respect to selectivity for shapes as well as for direction of motion in the STS. About 90% of shape-selective neurons were located in the lower bank of STS (lSTS) assigned to the ventral pathway, while about 80% of direction-selective neurons existed in the upper bank of STS (uSTS) assigned to the dorsal pathway. The neurons showing selectivity for both shape and motion coexisted in lSTS as well as uSTS. This result indicates that integration or convergence of shape information and motion information can occur in both banks of STS. About 90% of STS neurons showing selectivity both for shapes defined by luminance cue and for shapes defined by motion cue were located in lSTS. They showed a highly similar shape preference between the different visual attributes, indicating cue-invariant shape selectivity. The cue-invariant shape-selectivity was modulated with target selection as well as with discrimination performance of monkeys. These results suggest that lSTS could be involved in cue-invariant shape discrimination, but not the uSTS.

AB  - Abstract
Visceral hypersensitivity is a hallmark of many clinical conditions and remains an ongoing medical challenge. Although the central neural mechanisms that regulate visceral hypersensitivity are incompletely understood, it has been suggested that stress and anxiety often act as initiating or exacerbating factors. Dysfunctional corticolimbic structures have been implicated in disorders of visceral hypersensitivity such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Moreover, the pattern of altered physiological responses to psychological and visceral stressors reported in IBS patients is also observed in the maternally separated (MS) rat model of IBS. However, the relative contribution of various divisions within the cortex to the altered stress responsivity of MS rats remains unknown. The aim of this study was to analyze the cellular activation pattern of the prefrontal cortex and amygdala in response to an acute psychological stressor (open field) and colorectal distension (CRD) using c-fos immunohistochemistry. Several corticoamygdalar structures were analyzed for the presence of c-fos-positive immunoreactivity including the prelimbic cortex, infralimbic cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex (both rostral and caudal) and the amygdala. Our data demonstrate distinct activation patterns within these corticoamygdalar regions including differential activation in basolateral versus central amygdala following exposure to CRD but not the open field stress. The identification of this neuronal activation pattern may provide further insight into the neurochemical pathways through which therapeutic strategies for IBS could be derived.

Introduction: Experience-based adaptation of emotional responses is an important faculty for cognitive and emotional functioning. Professional musicians represent an ideal model in which to elicit experience-driven changes in the emotional processing domain. The changes of the central representation of emotional arousal due to musical expertise are still largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the electroencephalogram (EEG) correlates of experience-driven changes in the domain of emotional arousal. Therefore, the differences in perceived (subjective arousal via ratings) and physiologically measured (EEG) arousal between amateur and professional musicians were examined. Procedure: A total of 15 professional and 19 amateur musicians listened to the first movement of Ludwig van Beethoven’s 5th symphony (duration = ∼7.4 min), during which a continuous 76-channel EEG was recorded. In a second session, the participants evaluated their emotional arousal during listening. In a tonic analysis, we examined the average EEG data over the time course of the music piece. For a phasic analysis, a fast Fourier transform was performed and covariance maps of spectral power were computed in association with the subjective arousal ratings. Results: The subjective arousal ratings of the professional musicians were more consistent than those of the amateur musicians. In the tonic EEG analysis, a mid-frontal theta activity was observed in the professionals. In the phasic EEG, the professionals exhibited an increase of posterior alpha, central delta, and beta rhythm during high arousal. Discussion: Professionals exhibited different and/or more intense patterns of emotional activation when they listened to the music. The results of the present study underscore the impact of music experience on emotional reactions.

AB  - Abstract
Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) induces phrenic long-term facilitation (pLTF) by a mechanism that requires spinal serotonin (5-HT) receptor activation and NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity. Here, we investigated whether: (1) spinal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity is necessary for AIH-induced pLTF; (2) episodic exogenous nitric oxide (NO) is sufficient to elicit phrenic motor facilitation (pMF) without AIH (i.e. pharmacologically); and (3) NO-induced pMF requires spinal 5-HT2B receptor and NOX activation. In anesthetized, mechanically ventilated adult male rats, AIH (3 × 5-min episodes; 10% O2; 5 min) elicited a progressive increase in the amplitude of integrated phrenic nerve bursts (i.e. pLTF), which lasted 60 min post-AIH (45.1 ± 8.6% baseline). Pre-treatment with intrathecal (i.t.) injections of a neuronal NOS inhibitor (nNOS-inhibitor-1) near the phrenic motor nucleus attenuated pLTF (14.7 ± 2.5%), whereas an inducible NOS (iNOS) inhibitor (1400 W) had no effect (56.3 ± 8.0%). Episodic i.t. injections (3 × 5 μl volume; 5 min) of a NO donor (sodium nitroprusside; SNP) elicited pMF similar in time-course and magnitude (40.4 ± 6.0%, 60 min post-injection) to AIH-induced pLTF. SNP-induced pMF was blocked by a 5-HT2B receptor antagonist (SB206553), a superoxide dismutase mimetic (MnTMPyP), and two NOX inhibitors (apocynin and DPI). Neither pLTF nor pMF was affected by pre-treatment with a protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor (KT-5823). Thus, spinal nNOS activity is necessary for AIH-induced pLTF, and episodic spinal NO is sufficient to elicit pMF by a mechanism that requires 5-HT2B receptor activation and NOX-derived ROS formation, which indicates AIH (and NO) elicits spinal respiratory plasticity by a nitrergic-serotonergic mechanism.

AB  - Abstract
Cerebral ischemia can be exacerbated by post-ischemic hyperglycemia, which may involve the cerebral sodium-glucose transporter (SGLT). However, the contribution of each SGLT isoform in cerebral ischemia is still unclear. SGLT-1, -3, -4, and -6 have been reported to be expressed in various brain regions. Among these isoforms, only SGLT-3 does not transport glucose, but depolarizes the plasma membrane when glucose is bound, suggesting that SGLT-3 is a glucose sensor. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the involvement of cerebral SGLT-3 in the development of ischemia. The mouse model of focal ischemia was generated by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Neuronal damage was assessed by histological and behavioral analyses. Fasting blood glucose levels on day 1 after MCAO were not affected in SGLT-3 siRNA-mediated knockdown of SGLT-3. The development of infarct volume and behavioral abnormalities on day 1 after MCAO were exacerbated in SGLT-3 knockdown mice (control group: n = 7, 94.2 ± 21.8 mm3, 2 (1.6–2.4), SGLT-3 knockdown group: n = 6, 1414.8 ± 492.4 mm3, 6 (5.8–6.3), P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, SGLT-3 expression levels were significantly decreased in the striatum (65.0 ± 8.1%, P &lt; 0.05) on day 1, and in the hippocampus (67.6 ± 7.2%, P &lt; 0.05) and hypothalamus (47.5 ± 5.1%, P &lt; 0.01) on day 3 after MCAO (n = 12–13). These effects were significantly inhibited by donepezil (DPZ) treatment (SGLT-3 knockdown group: n = 6, 1419.0 ± 181.5 mm3, 3.6 (3.4–3.7), SGLT-3 knockdown and 3 mg/kg DPZ-treated group: n = 5, 611.3 ± 205.3 mm3, 1.5 (1.4–1.8), P &lt; 0.05). Immunofluorescence revealed that SGLT-3 and choline acetyltransferase were co-localized in the cortex. Our results indicated that cerebral SGLT-3 suppressed neuronal damage by the activation of cholinergic neurons, which are neuroprotective. In contrast, other cerebral SGLT isoforms may be involved in the development of ischemia.

AB  - Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes 10–20% of acquired epilepsy in humans, resulting in an ictogenic region that is often located in the cerebral cortex. The thalamus provides heavy projections to the cortex and the activity of thalamocortical pathways is controlled by GABAergic afferents from the reticular nucleus of the thalamus (RT). As rats with TBI induced by lateral fluid-percussion injury (FPI) undergo epileptogenesis, we hypothesized that damage to the parvalbumin (PARV)-immunoreactive (ir) neurons in the RT is associated with seizure susceptibility after lateral FPI. To address this hypothesis, adult Sprague–Dawley rats (n = 13) were injured with lateral FPI. At 6 months post-TBI, each animal underwent a pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) seizure susceptibility test and 2 weeks of continuous video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring for detection of the occurrence of spontaneous seizures. Thereafter, the brain was processed for PARV immunohistochemistry. We (a) estimated the total number of PARV-ir neurons in the RT using unbiased stereology, (b) measured the volume of the ventroposteromedial (VPM) and ventroposterolateral (VPL) nuclei of the thalamus, which receive PARV-ir inputs from the RT and project to the perilesional cortex, (c) quantified the density of PARV-ir terminals in the VPM–VPL, and (d) studied the expression of GABAA receptor subunits in a separate group of rats using laser-dissection of the thalamus followed by Real-Time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) array studies. At 6 months post-TBI, only 64% of PARV-ir neurons were remaining in the RT ipsilaterally (p &lt; 0.001 as compared to controls) and 84% contralaterally (p &lt; 0.05). Accordingly, the volume of the ipsilateral RT was 58% of that in controls ipsilaterally (p &lt; 0.001) and 90% contralaterally (p &gt; 0.05). Also, the volume of the VPM–VPL was only 51% of that in controls ipsilaterally (p &lt; 0.001) and 91% contralaterally (p &lt; 0.05). The density of PARV-ir axonal labeling was remarkably increased in the lateral aspects of the VPM and VPL (both p &lt; 0.001). Expression of the ε- and θ-subunits of the GABAA receptor was down-regulated (0.152, p &lt; 0.01 and 0.302, p &lt; 0.05, respectively), which could relate to the inclusion of the hypothalamus into the tissue analyzed with RT-PCR arrays. In controls, the lower the number of PARV-ir neurons in the RT, the higher the seizure susceptibility in the PTZ test. Rats with TBI showed seizure susceptibility comparable to that in controls with the lowest number of PARV-ir neurons in the RT. Our data show that the RT and VPM–VPL undergo remarkable degeneration after lateral-FPI which results in reorganization of PARV-ir terminals in the VPM–VPL. The contribution of RT damage to seizure susceptibility and post-traumatic epileptogenesis deserves further studies.

AB  - Abstract
The pontine Kölliker-Fuse nucleus (KF) has established functions in the regulation of inspiratory–expiratory phase transition and the regulation of upper airway patency via laryngeal valving mechanisms. Here we studied the role of the KF in the gating and modulation of eupneic hypoglossal motor activity (HNA) using the in situ perfused brainstem preparation, which displays robust inspiratory HNA. Microinjection of glutamate into the KF area triggered complex and often biphasic modulation (excitation/inhibition or inhibition/excitation) of HNA. Subsequent transient pharmacological inhibition of KF by unilateral microinjection of GABA-A receptor agonist isoguvacine reduced HNA and while bilateral microinjections completely abolished HNA. Our results indicate that mixed and overlapping KF pre-motor neurons provide eupneic drive for inspiratory HNA and postinspiratory vagal nerve activity. Both motor activities have important functions in the regulation of upper airway patency during eupnea but also during various oro-pharyngeal behaviors. These results have potential implications in the contribution of state-dependent modulation of KF hypoglossal pre-motor neurons during sleep–wake cycle to obstructive sleep apnea.

AB  - Abstract
Cortical microcircuitry plays a pivotal role in encoding sensory information reaching the cortex. However, the fundamental knowledge concerning the mechanisms that govern feature-encoding by these sub-networks is still sparse. Here, we show through multi-electrode recordings in V1 of conventionally prepared anesthetized cats, that an avalanche of synergistic neural activity occurs between functionally connected neurons in a cell-assembly in response to the presented stimulus. The results specifically show that once the reference neuron spikes in a connected neuron-pair, it facilitates the response of its companion (target) neuron for 50 ms and, thereafter, the excitability of the target neuron declines. On the other hand, the functionally unconnected neurons do not facilitate each other’s activity within the 50-ms time-window. The added excitation (facilitation) of connected neurons is almost four times the responsiveness of unconnected neurons. This suggests that connectedness confers the added excitability to neurons; consequently leading to feature-encoding within the emergent 50-ms-period. Furthermore, the facilitation significantly decreases as a function of orientation selectivity spread.

AB  - Abstract
Spontaneous cord dorsum potentials (spontaneous CDPs) are produced by the activation of dorsal horn neurons distributed along the L4 to S1 spinal cord segments, in Rexed’s laminae III–VI, in the same region in which there are interneurons rhythmically bursting during fictive scratching in cats. An interesting observation is that spontaneous CDPs are not rhythmically superimposed on the sinusoidal CDPs generated during fictive scratching episodes, thus suggesting that the interneurons producing both types of CDPs belong to different spinal circuits. In order to provide experimental data to support this hypothesis, we recorded unitary activity of neurons in the L6 spinal cord segment. We found that the neurons firing rhythmically during the sinusoidal CDPs associated with the extensor, flexor or intermediate phases of scratching were not synchronized with the spontaneous CDPs. Moreover, we found that the neurons firing during the spontaneous CDPs were not synchronized with the sinusoidal CDPs. These results suggest that the neurons involved in the occurrence of spontaneous CDPs are not part of the spinal cord central pattern generators (CPGs). This study will be relevant for understanding the relationships between the spinal cord neuronal populations firing spontaneously and the CPGs, in the intact and injured spinal cord.

AB  - Abstract
Dimebon (dimebolin or latrepirdine), originally developed as an anti-histaminic drug, has been investigated and proposed as a cognitive enhancer for treating neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s diseases, and more recently schizophrenia. This study was conducted to evaluate the potential neuroprotective effect of dimebon during brain ischemia using rat hippocampal slices subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation followed by a reoxygenation period (OGD/Reox) or glutamate excitotoxicity. Dimebon, incubated during the OGD/Reox period, caused a concentration -dependent protective effect of hippocampal slices; maximum protection (85%) was achieved at 30 μM. Mitochondrial membrane depolarization, reactive oxygen species of oxygen (ROS) production, nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) induction and translocation of p65 to the nucleus induced by OGD/Reox were significantly reduced in dimebon-treated hippocampal slices. In the glutamate-induced excitotoxicity model, dimebon also afforded a concentration-dependent protective effect that was significantly higher than that obtained with memantine, a non-competitive N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist. When changes in the intracellular calcium concentration were evaluated in Fluo-4-loaded rat hippocampal neurons, glutamate-induced calcium transients were reduced by 20% with dimebon. These results suggest that dimebon could counteract different pathophysiological processes during ischemic brain damage and, could therefore, be considered as a novel therapeutic strategy for cerebral ischemia-reoxygenation injury.

AB  - Abstract
Electric stimulation using retinal implants allows blind people to re-experience a rudimentary kind of vision. The elicited percepts or so called ‘phosphenes’ are highly inconstant and therefore do not restore vision properly. The better knowledge of how retinal neurons, especially retinal ganglion cells, respond to electric stimulation will help to develop more sophisticated stimulation strategies. Special anatomic and physiologic properties like a band of highly dense sodium channels in retinal ganglion cells may help to achieve a focal activation of target cells and as a result better restoration of vision. A portion of retinal ganglion cell axons, about 40 μm from the soma and between 25 and 40 μm in length, shows a specific biophysical property. Electrode locations close to a band of highly dense sodium channels which were identified immunochemically show lowest thresholds during electric stimulation. The (modeled) thresholds for this kind of structure result in lowest thresholds as well. The influence on the location where action potentials are generated within the axon is far reaching. When a stimulating electrode is positioned far outside the actual band region the site of spike initiation still remains within the sodium channel band. These findings suggest to further examine the key mechanisms of activation for retinal ganglion cells because focal activation without influencing passing axons of neurons located far away can improve the outcome of electric stimulation and therefore the development of retinal implants.

AB  - Abstract
Correlated electrophysiological and behavioral experiments in the snail Helix lucorum were conducted to investigate the contribution of nitric oxide (NO) to synaptic plasticity during withdrawal reflex and aversive context memory development. Time, stimulation frequency and number of tetani/electrical shocks were determined in vitro and in vivo. In isolated brain preparations, nerve tetanization accompanied by bath application of serotonin induced long-term facilitation (LTF) of the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) in withdrawal interneurons. Bathing with either the NO-synthase inhibitor N-omega-nitro-L-arginin (L-NNA) or the NO-scavenger 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-imidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO) before the tetanization prevented tetanus-induced long-term increase of EPSP.

Withdrawal interneurons are key elements in the network underlying aversive behavior, with LTF considered the basis for aversive learning. We hypothesized that L-NNA injections in free-behaving snails could influence aversive learning. Snails were trained for 1 or 5 days to remember the context in which they were shocked. In one-day training experiments, the snails received 5 electrical shocks in one context. Different groups of snails were sham-injected or L-NNA-injected before or after training. After training, the sham-injected groups demonstrated a significant increase in behavioral responses compared to the L-NNA-injected groups. On the following day, only sham-injected snails demonstrated altered behavioral responses, but no associative context differences were observed. These results correlated with the electrophysiological results. In another series of experiments, the snails received electrical shocks for 5 days. Testing on the second day after training demonstrated that the sham-injected group maintained selective aversive context memory, whereas the L-NNA-injected snails were not different between the two contexts.

Together these results demonstrated that inhibition of NO synthesis prevents memory formation and influences synaptic plasticity in the withdrawal interneurons that underlie the behavioral changes. This suggests that NO influences the behavior via regulation of synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Abstract
We have further developed a behavioral model of itch and pain in the lower hindlimb (calf) originally reported by LaMotte et al. (2011) that allows comparisons with responses of lumbar dorsal horn neurons to pruritic and noxious stimuli. Intradermal (id) microinjection of the pruritogens histamine, SLIGRL-NH2 (agonist of PAR-2 and MrgprC11) and chloroquine (agonist of MrgprA3) into the calf of the lower limb elicited significant biting and a small amount of licking directed to the injection site, over a 30-min time course. Following id injection of histamine, low-threshold mechanical stimuli reliably elicited discrete episodes of biting (alloknesis) over a longer time course; significantly less alloknesis was observed following id injection of SLIGRL-NH2. Capsaicin injections elicited licking but little biting. Following id injection of capsaicin, low-threshold mechanical stimuli elicited discrete hindlimb flinches (allodynia) over a prolonged (&gt;2 h) time course. In single-unit recordings from superficial lumbar dorsal horn neurons, low-threshold mechanically evoked responses were significantly enhanced, accompanied by receptive field expansion, following id injection of histamine in histamine-responsive neurons. This was not observed in histamine-insensitive neurons, or following id injection of saline or SLIGRL-NH2, regardless of whether the latter activated the neuron or not. These results suggest that itch-responsive neurons are selectively sensitized by histamine but not SLIGRL-NH2 to account for alloknesis. The presently described “calf” model appears to distinguish between itch- and pain-related behavioral responses, and provides a basis to investigate lumbar spinal neural mechanisms underlying itch, alloknesis, pain and allodynia.

AB  - Abstract
Many marine fishes change sex in response to social cues when the dominance hierarchy is perturbed. Arginine-vasotocin (AVT) and the mammalian homolog arginine vasopressin are neuropeptides involved in social and reproductive behaviors across vertebrate taxa. The goal of this study was to determine whether AVT signaling influences aggression and expression of c-Fos, a marker of neuroplasticity, in key brain regions of the social decision circuit in Amphiprion ocellaris clownfish, a species where behavioral dominance precedes gonadal sex change from male to female. In experiment 1, juvenile clownfish (average mass 2.5 g) were paired together in a tank (a total of 24 pairs), matched approximately for size with one fish randomly receiving either an intraperitoneal injection of the arginine vasopressin V1a receptor antagonist (Manning compound) or saline vehicle, and evaluated for aggressive and submissive behaviors over a 10-min period. The second experiment was a repeat of the first using five pairs of mature, reproductive males, except the animals interacted for 90-min immediately followed by euthanasia for immunohistochemical detection of c-Fos protein. Numbers of c-Fos-positive cells were quantified in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus (POA), the anterior tuberal nucleus (aTn), and periventricular nucleus of the posterior tuberculum (TPp). Manning compound significantly reduced aggression and the probability of winning the contest relative to saline (vehicle) controls. In experiment 2, saline-treated fish displayed approximately twice as many c-Fos-positive cells in the POA and 25% more in the TPp than the Manning-treated fish, no differences were observed in the aTn. Taken together, results suggest AVT signaling is necessary for aggressive behavior and expression of neuroplasticity in the POA and TPp that likely contributes to behavioral dominance and hence, sex change in A. ocellaris.

AB  - Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive neurological disorder that is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Dopamine, via the oxidative stress that it generates in the cytosol, could contribute to the selective loss of neurons observed in PD. Protein L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase (PIMT) is an enzyme that repairs L-isoaspartyl-containing proteins and possesses anti-apoptotic properties. PIMT expression has been shown to decrease with age. Together, these observations prompted us to investigate whether dopamine can regulate PIMT expression in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Here, we report that dopamine down-regulated PIMT at both gene and protein levels. The same inhibition of PIMT protein level was caused by the electron transport chain inhibitor, rotenone, which was accompanied, in both cases, by an increase in cell death and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In fact, pre-treatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine blocked PIMT dopamine-associated down-regulation. PCMT1 promoter mapping experiments allowed the identification of two regions that showed different sensitivity to DA action. A first region localized between 61 and 94 bp upstream of transcription start site was very sensitive to dopamine inhibition while a second region between 41 and 61 bp appeared more resistant to dopamine inhibitory effect. The inhibition of PCMT1 promoter activity was mediated by dopamine-induced ROS since it was prevented by the hydroxyl radical scavenger N,N′-dimethylthiourea. Conversely, H2O2 inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the transcriptional activity of PCMT1 promoter. Therefore, our findings identified new molecular mechanisms, cytosolic dopamine and its resulting ROS, as inhibitors of PIMT expression. This suggests that ROS generated from cytosolic dopamine could reduce both the PCMT1 gene promoter activity and the PIMT protein level thus decreasing its capacity to repair proteins involved in apoptosis and could contribute to neuronal cell death observed in PD.

AB  - Abstract
The suggestion of an anatomical and functional relationship between the basal ganglia and cerebellum is recent. Traditionally, these structures were considered as neuronal circuits working separately to organize and control goal-directed movements and cognitive functions. However, several studies in rodents and primates have described an anatomical interaction between cortico-basal and cortico-cerebellar networks. Most importantly, functional changes have been observed in one of these circuits when altering the other one. In this context, we aimed to accomplish an extensive description of cerebellar activation patterns using cFOS expression (cFOS-IR) after acute and chronic manipulation of dopaminergic activity. In the acute study, substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) activity was stimulated or suppressed by intra cerebral administration of picrotoxin or lidocaine, respectively. In addition, we analyzed cerebellar activity after the induction of a parkinsonism model, the tremulous jaw movements. In this model, tremulous jaw movements were induced in male rats by IP chronic administration of the dopamine antagonist haloperidol (1.5 mg/kg). Acute stimulation of SNc by picrotoxin increased cFOS-IR in the vermis and cerebellar hemispheres. However, lidocaine did not produce an effect. After 14 days of haloperidol treatment, the vermis and cerebellar hemispheres showed an opposite regulation of cFOS expression. Chronic dopaminergic antagonism lessened cFOS expression in the vermis but up-regulated such expression in the cerebellar hemisphere. Overall, the present data indicate a very close functional relationship between the basal ganglia and the cerebellum and they may allow a better understanding of disorders in which there are dopamine alterations.

The atrial volume receptor reflex arc serves to regulate plasma volume. Atrial volume receptors located in the endocardium of the atrial wall undergo mechanical deformation as blood is returned to the atria of the heart. The mechanosensitive channel(s) responsible for regulating plasma volume remain to be determined. Here we report that the TRP channel family members TRPC1 and TRPV4 were expressed in sensory nerve endings in the atrial endocardium. Furthermore, TRPC1 and TRPV4 were coincident with the nerve ending vesicle marker synaptophysin. Calcitonin gene-related peptide was exclusively confined to the myo- and epicardium of the atria. The small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK2 and SK4) were also present, however there was no relationship between SK and TRP channels. SK2 channels were expressed in nerves in the epicardium, while SK4 channels were in some regions of the endocardium but appeared to be present in epithelial cells rather than sensory endings. In conclusion, we have provided the first evidence for TRPC1 and TRPV4 channels as potential contributors to mechanosensation in the atrial volume receptors.

Tyrosine-hydroxylase-positive (TH+) amacrine cells release dopamine in a paracrine manner and also form GABA-ergic contact sites with inner retinal neurons. The best known sites are formed by TH+ fibrous rings and AII amacrine cell somata in stratum 1 of the inner plexiform layer (IPL). An AII amacrine cell is a highly compartmentalized neuron with relatively large soma, a stout dendritic stalk and two sets of processes, one showing lobular appearance and extending horizontally in stratum 1 and a second transversally elongated group of fibers in strata 4 and 5. Although, all of these compartments have been reported as tic sites, it is uncertain if TH+ amacrine cell inputs are homogeneously distributed or they rather target specific AII cell compartments. In this study we investigated the TH+/AII cell system by immunohistochemistry to map the potential synaptic contacts in the rabbit retina. We found numerous intimate contacts between the two amacrine cell populations throughout the IPL. However, TH+ fibers favored the soma/main stalk region of AII amacrine cells and only contacted lobular appendages and transversal processes sporadically. In addition to the well-studied contacts between AII cell somata and TH+ rings in stratum 1 we found that the main stalk region in stratum 3 serves as a secondary major target for TH+ axons. These data thus clearly show that TH+ contacts to AII amacrine cells are highly compartment specific.

AB  - Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a common and serious trauma which lacks efficient treatment. Inhibition of cell death in the trauma area is important for spinal cord protection during this process. In this study, necroptosis inhibitor necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) was used to treat SCI rats, to investigate the role of Nec-1 in the recovery of SCI. Nec-1 was found to reduce lesions, cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS), improve pathological conditions and blood supply in the spinal cord trauma area. Further study indicated that Nec-1 could inhibit necroptosis by inhibiting RIP1/3–MLKL recruitment and inhibit apoptosis by inhibiting Caspase 3 and Bax while activating Bcl-2. Ethological performance of SCI rats confirmed improvement and protection of physiological function by Nec-1. Nec-1 as a potential treatment for SCI warrants further study. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the role of Nec-1 in the treatment of traumatic SCI. Our research also found inhibition effects of Nec-1 on apoptosis, not only necroptosis – as reported by most publications.

AB  - Abstract
Electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve attenuates tumor necrosis factor (TNF) synthesis by macrophages and reduces the systemic inflammatory response. Current evidence suggests that the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor present in the celiac/superior mesenteric ganglia is a key component in vagus nerve signaling to the spleen; however, there is currently no direct anatomical evidence that the α7 receptor is present in the murine celiac/superior mesenteric ganglia. Our study addresses this deficiency by providing anatomical evidence that the α7 receptor is expressed within the celiac/superior mesenteric ganglia and splenic nerve fibers using immunohistochemistry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). α7 receptor mRNA is highly expressed in the celiac/superior mesenteric ganglia and at low levels in the spleen compared to the brain. Double-labeling for α7 and tyrosine hydroxylase shows that α7 receptor protein is present on noradrenergic neurons within the ganglia and prejunctionally on noradrenergic nerve fibers within the spleen. The α7 receptor in the ganglia provides a possible location for the action of α7-selective agonists, while prejunctional α7 receptor expressed on splenic nerves may induce an increase in norepinephrine release in a positive feedback system enhanced by lymphocyte-derived acetylcholine.

AB  - Abstract
Inflammation, oxidative and nitrosative stress underlie depression being assessed in rodents by the systemic administration of lipopolysacharide (LPS). There is an increasing body of evidence of an involvement of nitric oxide (NO) pathway in depression, but this issue was not investigated in LPS-induced model. Thus, herein we evaluated the effects of NO-pathway-modulating drugs, named aminoguanidine, l-NAME, sildenafil and l-arginine, on the behavioral (forced swimming test [FST], sucrose preference [SPT] and prepulse inhibition [PPI] of the startle) and neurochemical (glutathione [GSH], lipid peroxidation, IL-1β) alterations in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum as well as in BDNF levels in the hippocampus 24 h after LPS (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) administration, a time-point related to depressive-like behavior. Twenty-four hours post LPS there was an increase in immobility time in the FST, decrease in sucrose preference and PPI levels accompanied by a decrease in GSH levels and an increase in lipid peroxidation, IL-1β and hippocampal BDNF levels suggestive of a depressive-like state. The pretreatment with the NOS inhibitors, l-NAME and aminoguanidine as well as sildenafil prevented the behavioral and neurochemical alterations induced by LPS, although sildenafil and l-NAME were not able to prevent the increase in hippocampal BDNF levels induced by LPS. The iNOS inhibitor, aminoguanidine, and imipramine prevented all behavioral and neurochemical alterations induced by LPS. l-arginine did not prevent the alterations in immobility time, sucrose preference and GSH induced by LPS. Taken together our results show that the NO-cGMP pathway is important in the modulation of the depressive-like alterations induced by LPS.

AB  - Abstract
This study investigated the influence of vision and proprioception on the excitability of direct corticospinal (corticomotoneuronal) pathway to the soleus in young and elderly adults during upright standing. Ten young and 10 elderly adults stood upright on a rigid surface with eyes open or closed, and on foam mat with eyes open. The corticomotoneuronal excitability was investigated by assessing facilitation of the soleus H-reflex induced by subthreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The torque produced by the plantar flexor muscles during a maximal voluntary contraction was also measured. The maximal plantar flexion torque was significantly lower in elderly than in young adults (p &lt; 0.05). The activity of leg muscles, recorded by electromyography (EMG) was greater in elderly than in young adults regardless of balance conditions (p &lt; 0.05), and greater when standing on foam than in the other conditions (p &lt; 0.05), regardless of age. The H-reflex facilitation was greater for elderly [182.9 (45)%] than young adults [130.5 (33.1)%; p &lt; 0.05] but did not differ across sensory conditions (p &gt; 0.05). However, the amplitude of the H reflex conditioned by TMS relative to the amplitude of the test H reflex ratio was positively associated with EMG activity of the plantar flexor muscles during upright standing (r2 = 0.47; p &lt; 0.001). These results indicate that regardless of age the excitability of the corticomotoneuronal pathway is not modulated with changes in the sensory conditions during upright standing. Nonetheless, the corticomotoneural drive to control leg muscle during upright standing increases with the level of soleus muscle activity.

AB  - Abstract
Tetrodotoxin-sensitive persistent sodium currents, INaP, that activate at subthreshold voltages, have been detected in numerous vertebrate and invertebrate neurons. These currents are believed to be critical for regulating neuronal excitability. However, the molecular mechanism underlying INaP is controversial. In this study, we identified an INaP with a broad range of voltage dependence, from −60 mV to 20 mV, in a Drosophila sodium channel variant expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Mutational analysis revealed that two variant-specific amino acid changes, I260T in the S4–S5 linker of domain I (ILS4–S5) and A1731V in the voltage sensor S4 of domain IV (IVS4), contribute to the INaP. I260T is critical for the portion of INaP at hyperpolarized potentials. The T260-mediated INaP is likely the result of window currents flowing in the voltage range where the activation and inactivation curves overlap. A1731V is responsible for impaired inactivation and contributes to the portion of INaP at depolarized potentials. Furthermore, A1731V causes enhanced activity of two site-3 toxins which induce persistent currents by inhibiting the outward movement of IVS4, suggesting that A1731V inhibits the outward movement of IVS4. These results provided molecular evidence for the involvement of distinct mechanisms in the generation of INaP: T260 contributes to INaP via enhancement of the window current, whereas V1731 impairs fast inactivation probably by inhibiting the outward movement of IVS4.

AB  - Abstract
Ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic most commonly used in many pediatric procedures, has been reported in many animal studies to cause widespread neuroapoptosis in the neonatal brain after exposure in high doses and/or for a prolonged period. This neurodegenerative change occurs most severely in the forebrain including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) that is an important brain structure for mediating a variety of cognitive functions. However, it is still unknown whether such apoptotic neurodegeneration early in life would subsequently impair the synaptic plasticity of the ACC later in life. In this study, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from the ACC brain slices of young adult rats to examine any alterations in long-term synaptic plasticity caused by neonatal ketamine exposure. Ketamine was administered at postnatal day 4–7 (subcutaneous injections, 20 mg/kg given six times, once every 2 h). At 3–4 weeks of age, long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced and recorded by monitoring excitatory postsynaptic currents from ACC slices. We found that the induction of LTP in the ACC was significantly reduced when compared to the control group. The LTP impairment was accompanied by an increase in the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission and a decrease in GABA inhibitory synaptic transmission in neurons of the ACC. Thus, our present findings show that neonatal ketamine exposure causes a significant LTP impairment in the ACC. We suggest that the imbalanced synaptic transmission is likely to contribute to ketamine-induced LTP impairment in the ACC.

AB  - Abstract
Nuclear distribution factor E homolog like 1 (NDEL1) plays an important role in mitosis, neuronal migration, and microtubule organization during brain development by binding to disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) or lissencephaly (LIS1). Although some evidence has suggested that DISC1 expression is altered in epilepsy, few studies have reported the relationship between NDEL1 and the etiology of epilepsy. In present study, we first investigated the expression of NDEL1 and its binding protein DISC1 after pilocarpine-induced epilepsy in male C57BL/6 mice. Data revealed that the mRNA and protein expression of NDEL1 and DISC1 in the whole hippocampus increased during the spontaneous seizure period after status epilepticus (SE). Interestingly, however, the expression of NDEL1 was decreased in the cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) and dentate gyrus (DG) regions. Moreover, SE also increased the number of blood vessels that fed the CA3 and DG regions of the hippocampus and increased the incidence of abnormalities in capillary network formation where NDEL1 protein was expressed positively. Meanwhile, the expression of phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) was also increased during the spontaneous seizure period, with a similar expression pattern as NDEL1 and DISC1. Based on these results, we hypothesize that NDEL1 might interact with DISC1 to activate ERK signaling and function as a potential protective factor during the spontaneous seizure period after pilocarpine-induced SE.

AB  - Abstract
Fear conditioning has been proposed as an important factor involved in the etiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We examined fear processing in PTSD patients with mild symptoms and in individuals who did not develop symptoms (both groups consisting of victims of a bank robbery), through the study of fear-conditioned response. Conditioned responses were quantified by the skin conductance response (SCR) and the facial thermal response, the latter being measured by high-resolution functional thermal infrared (fIR) imaging.

We found: (a) a change of the physiological parameters with respect to the baseline condition in both control subjects and PTSD patients during the conditioning phase; (b) the permanence of the conditioning effect in the maintenance phase in both control and PTSD patients; (c) patients and controls did differ for the variation across the phases of the physiological parameters rather than for their absolute values, showing that PTSD patients had a prolonged excitation and higher tonic component of autonomic activity. These results, although preliminary, indicate that the analysis of SCR and facial thermal response during the conditioning paradigm is a promising psychometric method of investigation, even in the case of low level of PTSD symptom severity. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to discriminate between control subjects and PTSD patients with mild symptoms through infrared thermal imaging. It may suggest feasible approaches for diagnostic screening in the early phases of the disorder and in the assessment of preventive measures and therapies.

AB  - Abstract
The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is typically considered our autonomous clock synchronizing behavior with physiological parameters such as blood pressure (BP), just transmitting time independent of physiology. Yet several studies show that the SCN is involved in the etiology of hypertension. Here, we demonstrate that the SCN is incorporated in a neuronal feedback circuit arising from the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), modulating cardiovascular reactivity. Tracer injections into the SCN of male Wistar rats revealed retrogradely filled neurons in the caudal NTS, where BP information is integrated. These NTS projections to the SCN were shown to be glutamatergic and to terminate in the ventrolateral part of the SCN where light information also enters. BP elevations not only induced increased neuronal activity as measured by c-Fos in the NTS but also in the SCN. Lesioning the caudal NTS prevented this activation. The increase of SCN neuronal activity by hypertensive stimuli suggested involvement of the SCN in counteracting BP elevations. Examining this possibility we observed that elevation of BP, induced by α1-agonist infusion, was more than twice the magnitude in SCN-lesioned animals as compared to in controls, indicating indeed an active involvement of the SCN in short-term BP regulation. We propose that the SCN receives BP information directly from the NTS enabling it to react to hemodynamic perturbations, suggesting the SCN to be part of a homeostatic circuit adapting BP response. We discuss how these findings could explain why lifestyle conditions violating signals of the biological clock may, in the long-term, result in cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Abstract
In the adult mammalian brain niches for neural stem cells are maintained, which enable a steady-state neurogenesis. This process is tightly regulated by multiple niche factors, including Notch and NF-κB signaling. The NF-κB-activating-protein (NKAP) has previously been shown to act as Notch co-repressor component by binding CIR and recruiting HDAC3 in T-cell development and furthermore to regulate NF-κB-dependent transcription. Here, we provide first evidence for the expression of NKAP in neurogenic cells of the adult mammalian brain. NKAP is highly expressed in Mash1+ transit amplifying cells and PSA-NCAM+ migrating neuroblasts throughout the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the rostral migratory stream (RMS), as well as in the hippocampus. We further show that NKAP expression levels are downregulated during the course of the RMS. Eventually, most differentiated cells in the olfactory bulb (OB) and the corpus callosum only display low levels of NKAP expression. Finally, large subsets of mature neurons in the OB, the hippocampus and the thalamus express NKAP at high levels, suggesting an additional role of NKAP outside of SVZ progenitor cells.

Missense mutation R192Q in the CACNA1A gene causes familial hemiplegic migraine type-1 (FHM1), a monogenic subtype of migraine with aura. Using knock-in (KI) gene targeting we introduced this mutation into the mouse gene and generated a transgenic mouse model to investigate basic mechanisms of migraine pathophysiology. While FHM1 R192Q KI trigeminal ganglia were previously shown to exhibit constitutive up-regulation of ATP-gated P2X3 receptors, little is known about the firing properties of trigeminal sensory neurons, which convey nociceptive inputs to higher brain centers. We patch-clamped trigeminal sensory neurons to search for differences in firing properties between wildtype (WT) and KI cells in culture. Although various subclasses of trigeminal neurons were observed with respect to their firing patterns evoked by intracellular current injection, their distribution among WT and KI cells was similar with only small differences in rheobase or input resistance values. However, when neurons were excited by either α,β-methyl-ATP to stimulate P2X3 receptors or capsaicin to activate transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV1) receptors, the firing threshold in KI neurons was significantly lowered and followed by a larger number of spikes. Activation by α,β-methyl-ATP was associated with a transient cluster of action potentials, while capsaicin elicited more persistent firing. Using α,β-methyl-ATP or capsaicin, two functional classes of WT or KI neurons were distinguished according to the first spike latency, which suggests that a subgroup of neurons may be indirectly activated, probably via crosstalk between neurons and satellite glial cells. Thus, our results are consistent with reported facilitated trigeminal pain behavior of FHM1 R192Q KI mice.

AB  - Abstract
Rotenone, which is used as a pesticide and insecticide, has been shown to cause systemic inhibition of mitochondrial complex I activity, with consequent degeneration of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra and striatum, as observed in Parkinson’s disease. A novel intrastriatal rotenone model of Parkinson’s disease was used to examine the neuroprotective effects of valproic acid (VPA), which is known to upregulate neurotrophic factors and other protective proteins in the brain. Sham or lesioned rats were treated with either vehicle or VPA at a dose of 4 mg/mL in drinking water. The right striatum was lesioned by infusion of rotenone at three sites (2 μg/site) along its rostro-caudal axis. A forelimb asymmetry (cylinder) test indicated a significant (p &lt; 0.01) decrease in use of the contralateral forelimb in rotenone-lesioned animals, in the third week post-lesioning, which was abolished by VPA treatment. Similarly, a significant (p &lt; 0.01) and persistent increase in use of the ipsilateral forelimb in lesioned animals over the 4 weeks of testing, was not seen in animals treated with VPA. Results of the asymmetry test illustrate that intrastriatal infusion of rotenone causes contralateral motor dysfunction, which is blocked by VPA. The significant increase in ipsilateral forelimb use has not been documented previously, and presumably represents a compensatory response in lesioned animals. Six weeks post-surgery, animals were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion. Subsequent immunohistochemical examination revealed a decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity within the striatum and substantia nigra of rotenone-lesioned animals. VPA treatment attenuated the decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase in the striatum and abolished it in the substantia nigra. Stereological cell counting indicated a significant (p &lt; 0.05) decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra of rotenone-lesioned animals, which was confirmed by Nissl staining. Importantly, this loss of dopamine neurons in rotenone-lesioned animals, was blocked by chronic VPA treatment. These findings strongly support the therapeutic potential of VPA in Parkinson’s disease.

AB  - Abstract
In rodents, many social behaviors are driven by the sense of smell. The vomeronasal organ (VNO), part of the accessory olfactory system mediates many of these chemically driven behaviors. The VNO is heavily vascularized, and is readily accessible to circulating peptide or steroid hormones. Potentially, this allows circulating hormones to alter behavior through modulating the output of the primary sensory neurons in the VNO, the vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs). Based on this, we hypothesized that steroid hormones, in particular 17β-estradiol, would modulate activity of VSNs. In this paper, we show that the estrogen receptors, GPR30 and ERα, were present in VSNs and that estradiol may be synthesized locally in the VNO. Our results also showed that 17β-estradiol decreased responses of isolated VSNs to dilute urine, a potent natural stimulus, with respect to current amplitudes and depolarization. Further, 17β-estradiol increased the latency of the first action potential (AP) and the AP amplitude. Additionally, calcium responses to sulfated steroids (present in the low molecular weight fraction of urine) that act as ligands for apical vomeronasal receptors were decreased by 17β-estradiol. In conclusion, we show that estradiol modulates odorant responses mediated by VSNs and hence paves the way for future studies to better understand the mechanisms by which odorant mediated behavior is altered by endocrine status of the animal.

AB  - Abstract
RanBP9 is a multi-domain scaffolding protein known to integrate extracellular signaling with intracellular targets. We previously demonstrated that RanBP9 enhances Aβ generation and amyloid plaque burden which results in loss of specific pre- and postsynaptic proteins in vivo in a transgenic mouse model. Additionally, we showed that the levels of spinophilin, a marker of dendritic spines were inversely proportional to the RanBP9 protein levels within the synaptosomes isolated from AD brains. In the present study, we found reduced dendritic intersections within the layer 6 pyramidal neurons of the cortex as well as the hippocampus of RanBP9 transgenic mice compared to age-matched wild-type (WT) controls at 12 months of age but not at 6 months. Similarly, the dendritic spine numbers were reduced in the cortex at only 12 months of age by 30% (p &lt; 0.01), but not at 6 months. In the hippocampus also the spine densities were reduced at 12 months of age (38%, p &lt; 0.01) in the RanBP9 transgenic mice. Interestingly, the levels of phosphorylated form of cofilin, an actin binding protein that plays crucial role in the regulation of spine numbers were significantly decreased in the cortical synaptosomes at only 12 months of age by 26% (p &lt; 0.01). In the hippocampal synaptosomes, the decrease in cofilin levels were 36% (p &lt; 0.01) at 12 months of age. Thus dendritic arbor and spine density were directly correlated to the levels of phosphorylated form of cofilin in the RanBP9 transgenic mice. Similarly, cortical synaptosomes showed a 20% (p &lt; 0.01) reduction in the levels of spinophilin in the RanBP9 transgenic mice. These results provided the physical basis for the loss of synaptic proteins by RanBP9 and most importantly it also explains the impaired spatial learning and memory skills previously observed in the RanBP9 transgenic mice.

AB  - Abstract
The present study tested whether and how motor experience with a specific tool affects motor representation of a specific movement. To this aim, we considered a group of expert tennis players and a control group of athletic individuals without tennis experience. Participants were asked to execute 20 single forehands into the wall with a tennis racket (movement execution – ME) and, afterward, to produce a kinesthetic image of themselves while executing the same movements (motor imagery – MI). During MI participants handled one of the following tools: a tennis racket, a tennis-like racket and an umbrella. Results showed that the duration of the real and the imagined movements were almost similar when participants of both groups held the tennis rackets. In contrast, when tennis players handled the tools not specific for tennis the duration of the imagined movements increased significantly compared to the MI duration with a tennis racket. On the opposite, the handled tool did not modulate MI performances of the control group. In conclusion, this study showed that motor representation of subjects who developed motor skills associated to tool-use is reliant on the object used to practice movements. This finding suggests that, although MI mainly relies on the activity of cortical motor regions, non-motor information – as the use of the tool to practice movement – strongly affects the MI performance.

AB  - Abstract
Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) have the ability to divide or to growth arrest and differentiate into myelinating oligodendrocytes in the developing brain. Due to their high number and the persistence of their proliferative capacity in the adult brain, OPCs are being studied as potential targets for myelin repair and also as a potential source of brain tumors. This study addresses the molecular mechanisms regulating the transcriptional changes occurring at the critical transition between proliferation and cell cycle exit in cultured OPCs. Using bioinformatic analysis of existing datasets, we identified c-Myc as a key transcriptional regulator of this transition and confirmed direct binding of this transcription factor to identified target genes using chromatin immunoprecipitation. The expression of c-Myc was elevated in proliferating OPCs, where it also bound to the promoter of genes involved in cell cycle regulation (i.e. Cdc2) or chromosome organization (i.e. H2afz). Silencing of c-Myc was associated with decreased histone acetylation at target gene promoters and consequent decrease of gene transcripts. c-Myc silencing also induced a global increase of repressive histone methylation and premature peripheral nuclear chromatin compaction while promoting the progression towards differentiation. We conclude that c-Myc is an important modulator of the transition between proliferation and differentiation of OPCs, although its decrease is not sufficient to induce progression into a myelinating phenotype.

AB  - Abstract
In a previous work we found that nitric oxide (NO) and cyclicGMP (cGMP) inhibit glutamatergic synaptic transmission in trigeminal motoneurons (MnV). Here we study the actions of the NO/cGMP signaling pathway on glycinergic synaptic transmission in trigeminal and hypoglossal motoneurons (MnXII) in brain stem slices of neonatal rats. Glycinergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were recorded in MnV by stimulation of the supratrigeminal nucleus (SuV) and in MnXII by stimulation of the nucleus of Roller. The NO donor DETA/NONOate (DETA/NO) reduced the amplitude of the IPSC to 58.1 ± 4.2% of control values in MnV. In the presence of YC-1, a modulator of guanylate cyclase that acts as a NO sensitizer, lower and otherwise ineffective concentrations of DETA/NO induced a reduction of the IPSC to 47.2 ± 15.6%. NO effects were mimicked by 8 bromo cyclicGMP (8BrcGMP). They were accompanied by an increase in the paired pulse facilitation (PPF) and in the failure rate of evoked IPSCs. 8BrcGMP did not modify the glycinergic currents elicited by exogenous glycine. In MnXII the IPSCs were also reduced by NO donors and 8BrcGMP to 52.9 ± 6.3% and 45.9 ± 4% of control values, respectively. In these neurons, but not in MnV, we also observed excitatory postsynaptic actions of NO donors. We propose that the differences between the two motor pools may be due to a differential development of the nitrergic system in the two nuclei. Our data show that NO, through its second messenger cGMP, reduces inhibitory glycinergic synaptic transmission in both MnV and MnXII. For MnV, evidence in favor of presynaptic inhibition of glycine release is presented. Given our previous data together with the current results, we propose that the NO/cGMP signaling pathway participates pre- and postsynaptically in the combined regulation of MnV and MnXII activities in motor acts in which they participate.

AB  - Abstract
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is often found to co-exist with non-core behavioral manifestations that include difficulties in disengagement of attention to sensory cues. Here we examined whether this behavioral abnormality can be induced in rats prenatally exposed to valproic acid (VPA), a well-established teratogen associated with ASD animal models. We tested rats using an auditory-cued sensorimotor task (ACST) based on the premise that ACST will be more sensitive to developmental changes in temporal association cortex (TeA) of the posterior attention system. We show that VPA rats learned the ACST markedly faster than control animals, but they exhibited a profound preoccupation with cues associated with the expectancy at the reward location such that disengagement was disrupted. Control rats on the other hand were able to disengage and utilize auditory cues for re-engagement. However, both control and VPA-treated rats performed similarly when tested on novel object recognition (NOR) and novel context mismatch (NOCM) behavioral tasks that are known to be sensitive to normal perirhinal and prefrontal network functioning respectively. Consistent with disrupted posterior rather than frontal networks, we also report that VPA can selectively act on deep-layer TeA cortical neurons by showing that VPA increased dendritic density in isolated deep-layer TeA but not frontal neurons. These results describe a useful approach to examine the role of cue-dependent control of attention systems in rodent models of autism and suggest that disengagement impairments may arise from an inability to modify behavior through the appropriate use of sensory cue associations.

AB  - Abstract
Curculigoside A may be a powerful way of protecting the brain against a wide variety of injury. In the present study, we sought to elucidate whether Curculigoside A contributes to induce angiogenesis and its mechanisms. To this end, we examined the role of Curculigoside A on proliferation, invasion, and tube formation in the human brain microvascular endothelial cell line (HBMEC) in vitro. For studying mechanism, the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) inhibitor 2-naphthol-AS-E-phosphate (KG-501), early growth response 3 (Egr-3) siRNA, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antagonist sFlt-1 and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) blocker SU-1498 were used. Human brain microvascular endothelial cell line (HMBEC) proliferation was tested by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). Scratch adhesion test was used to assess the ability of invasion. A matrigel tube formation assay was performed to test capillary tube formation ability. Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1)/Egr-3/CREB/VEGF pathway activation in HMBEC was tested by Western blot analysis. Our data suggested that Curculigoside A induced angiogenesis in vitro by enhancing the proliferation, invasion and tube formation. VEGF expression was increased by Curculigoside A and counteracted by the soluble VEGF receptor 1 (sFlt-1, VEGF antagonist) and KG-501 in HMBEC. Tube formation was enhanced by Curculigoside A and counteracted by VEGF receptor blocker-SU1498, KG-501 and Egr-3 siRNA. It may be suggested that Curculigoside A induces angiogenesis in vitro via a programed VCAM-1/Egr-3/CREB/VEGF signaling axis.

AB  - Abstract
Mild cognitive impairments have been described in one-third of patients with Duchenne muscle dystrophy (DMD). DMD is characterized by progressive and irreversible muscle degeneration caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene and lack of the protein expression. Previously, we have reported altered concentrations of α7- and β2-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in hippocampal membranes of dystrophic (mdx) mice. This suggests that alterations in the central cholinergic synapses are associated with dystrophin deficiency. In this study, we examined the release of acetylcholine (ACh) and the level of the vesicular ACh transporter (VAChT) using synaptosomes isolated from brain regions that normally have a high density of dystrophin (cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum), in control and mdx mice at 4 and 12 months of age. ACh release evoked by nicotinic stimulation or K+ depolarization was measured as the tritium outflow from superfused synaptosomes preloaded with [3H]-choline. The results showed that the evoked tritium release was Ca2+-dependent and mostly formed by [3H]-ACh. β2-containing nAChRs were involved in agonist-evoked [3H]-ACh release in control and mdx preparations. In hippocampal synaptosomes from 12-month-old mdx mice, nAChR-evoked [3H]-ACh release increased by 57% compared to age-matched controls. Moreover, there was a 98% increase in [3H]-ACh release compared to 4-month-old mdx mice. [3H]-ACh release evoked by K+ depolarization was not altered, while the VAChT protein level was decreased (19%) compared to that of age-matched controls. In cortical and cerebellar preparations, there was no difference in nAChR-evoked [3H]-ACh release and VAChT levels between mdx and age-matched control groups. Our previous findings and the presynaptic alterations observed in the hippocampi of 12-month-old mdx mice indicate possible dysfunction of nicotinic cholinergic synapses associated with dystrophin deficiency. These changes may contribute to the cognitive and behavioral abnormalities described in dystrophic mice and patients with DMD.

AB  - Abstract
The interaction between excitatory and inhibitory inputs is critical to neuronal signal processing. However, little is known about this fundamental property, largely due to the inability to clearly isolate the respective inputs. Here we took advantage of the characteristic stereotypical architecture of synaptic connections in the main olfactory bulb, which enabled us to entirely separate excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Using paired stimulation of two glomeruli located apart at different intensities, we separately elicited excitatory and inhibitory inputs and mimicked stimulation of competing mitral cells (MCs) with different odorants. We performed dual whole-cell patch recording of evoked excitatory postsynaptic responses (EPSPs) and inhibitory postsynaptic responses (IPSPs) in current-clamp mode from two competitive MCs that are connected to the two stimulated glomeruli in slices of the main olfactory bulb in 2–3-week-old rats. We deliberately held the recorded cells at a relative hyperpolarized potential. This manipulation not only suppressed action potential generation but also excluded the possible contamination of inhibitory components in excitatory inputs. We found that in weakly activated MCs repetitive EPSP–IPSP interactions (5 Hz, 180 times) induced long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) in convergent excitatory and inhibitory inputs, respectively. Unexpectedly, these forms of plasticity depend on activity of somatic (mainly non-synaptic) NMDA receptors (NMDARs). In contrast, the same repetitive stimulation induced the LTP of excitatory inputs in strongly activated MCs (MC2) that require activity of synaptic NMDARs. These distinct forms of plasticity in the developing olfactory circuit may represent a novel rule of modification in convergent inputs that leads to decorrelation of inputs and facilitates odor discrimination.

AB  - Abstract
Glutamate-induced excitotoxicity involves a state of acute oxidative stress, which is a crucial event during neuronal degeneration and is part of the physiopathology of neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we evaluated the ability of sulforaphane (SULF), a natural dietary isothiocyanate, to induce the activation of transcription factor Nrf2 (a master regulator of redox state in the cell) in a model of striatal degeneration in rats infused with quinolinic acid (QUIN). Male Wistar rats received SULF (5 mg/kg, i.p.) 24 h and 5 min before the intrastriatal infusion of QUIN. SULF increased the reduced glutathione (GSH) levels 4 h after QUIN infusion, which was associated with its ability to increase the activity of glutathione reductase (GR), an antioxidant enzyme capable to regenerate GSH levels at 24 h. Moreover, SULF treatment increased glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, while no changes were observed in γ-glutamyl cysteine ligase (GCL) activity. SULF treatment also prevented QUIN-induced oxidative stress (measured by oxidized proteins levels), the histological damage and the circling behavior. These results suggest that the protective effect of SULF could be related to its ability to preserve GSH levels and increase GPx and GR activities.

AB  - Abstract
Aspirin-triggered Lipoxin A4 (ATL), as a Lipoxin A4 (LXA4) epimer, is endogenously produced by aspirin-acetylated cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) and plays a vital role in endogenous anti-inflammation via the LXA4 receptor (ALX). Recent investigations have indicated that spinal neuroinflammation and the activation of the Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2)/Signal Transducers and Transcription Activators 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway are involved in neuropathic pain states. However, the effect of ATL on neuroinflammation and JAK2/STAT3 signaling in chronic constriction injury (CCI)-induced neuropathic pain in rats has not been well-studied. The present study demonstrated the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect of ATL on neuropathic pain and assessed the role of spinal JAK2/STAT3 signaling on the effect of ATL. Intrathecal administration of ATL significantly attenuated mechanical allodynia via spinal ALX and inhibited the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) on day 7 of CCI surgery. In addition, ATL markedly suppressed the upregulation of p-STAT3 induced by the neuropathic pain. Blockade of JAK2–STAT3 signaling with intrathecal administration of the JAK2 inhibitor AG490 or the STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201 clearly reduced mechanical allodynia and the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in CCI rats. Interestingly, inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling via ATL or the specific signaling inhibitor (AG49, S3I-201) further promoted the increased expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) mRNA in the spinal cord induced by CCI surgery. Taken together, our results suggested that the analgesic effect of ATL was mediated by inhibiting spinal JAK2/STAT3 signaling and hence the spinal neuroinflammation in CCI rats.

AB  - Abstract
Successful regeneration after injury requires either the direct reformation of the circuit or the formation of a bridge circuit to provide partial functional return through a more indirect route. Presently, little is known about the specificity of how regenerating axons reconnect or reconstruct functional circuits. We have established an in vivo Dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) model, which in the presence of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), shows very robust regeneration of peptidergic nociceptive axons, but not other sensory axons. Expression of NGF in normal, non-injured animals leads to robust sprouting of only the peptidergic nociceptive axons. Interestingly, NGF-induced sprouting of these axons leads to severe chronic pain, whereas, regeneration leads to protective-like pain without chronic pain. Using this model we set out to compare differences in behavioral outcomes and circuit features between these two groups. In this study, we examined pre-synaptic and post-synaptic markers to evaluate the relationship between synaptic connections and behavioral responses. NGF-induced sprouting of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) axons resulted in a significant redistribution of synapses and cFos expression into the deeper dorsal horn. Regeneration of only the CGRP axons showed a general reduction in synapses and cFos expression within laminae I and II; however, inflammation of the hindpaw induced peripheral sensitization. These data show that although NGF-induced sprouting of peptidergic axons induces robust chronic pain and cFos expression throughout the entire dorsal horn, regeneration of the same axons resulted in normal protective pain with a synaptic and cFos distribution similar, albeit significantly less than that shown by the sprouting of CGRP axons.

AB  - Abstract
Brain ischemic tolerance is an endogenous protective mechanism activated by a preconditioning stimulus that is closely related to N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Glycine transporter type 1 (GlyT-1) inhibitors potentiate NMDAR and suggest an alternative strategy for brain preconditioning. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of brain preconditioning induced by sarcosine, a GlyT-1 inhibitor, against global cerebral ischemia and its relation to NMDAR. Sarcosine was administered over 7 days (300 or 500 mg/kg/day, ip) before the induction of a global cerebral ischemia model in Wistar rats (male, 8-week-old). It was observed that sarcosine preconditioning reduced cell death in rat hippocampi submitted to cerebral ischemia. Hippocampal levels of glycine were decreased in sarcosine-treated animals, which was associated with a reduction of [3H] glycine uptake and a decrease in glycine transporter expression (GlyT-1 and GlyT-2). The expression of glycine receptors and the NR1 and NR2A subunits of NMDAR were not affected by sarcosine preconditioning. However, sarcosine preconditioning reduced the expression of the NR2B subunits of NMDAR. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that sarcosine preconditioning induces ischemic tolerance against global cerebral ischemia and this neuroprotective state is associated with changes in glycine transport and reduction of NR2B-containing NMDAR expression.

AB  - Abstract
The coppery titi monkey (Callicebus cupreus) is a socially monogamous New World primate that has been studied in the field and the laboratory to investigate the behavioral neuroendocrinology of primate pair bonding and parental care. Arginine vasopressin has been shown to influence male titi monkey pair-bonding behavior, and studies are currently underway to examine the effects of oxytocin on titi monkey behavior and physiology. Here, we use receptor autoradiography to identify the distribution of arginine vasopressin 1a receptor (AVPR1a) and oxytocin receptors (OXTR) in hemispheres of titi monkey brain (n = 5). AVPR1a are diffuse and widespread throughout the brain, but the OXTR distribution is much more limited, with the densest binding being in the hippocampal formation (dentate gyrus, CA1 field) and the presubiculum (layers I and III). Moderate OXTR binding was detected in the nucleus basalis of Meynert, pulvinar, superior colliculus, layer 4C of primary visual cortex, periaqueductal gray (PAG), pontine gray, nucleus prepositus, and spinal trigeminal nucleus. OXTR mRNA overlapped with OXTR radioligand binding, confirming that the radioligand was detecting OXTR protein. AVPR1a binding is present throughout the cortex, especially in cingulate, insular, and occipital cortices, as well as in the caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens, central amygdala, endopiriform nucleus, hippocampus (CA4 field), globus pallidus, lateral geniculate nucleus, infundibulum, habenula, PAG, substantia nigra, olivary nucleus, hypoglossal nucleus, and cerebellum. Furthermore, we show that, in the titi monkey brain, the OXTR antagonist ALS-II-69 is highly selective for OXTR and that the AVPR1a antagonist SR49059 is highly selective for AVPR1a. Based on these results and the fact that both ALS-II-69 and SR49059 are non-peptide, small-molecule antagonists that should be capable of crossing the blood–brain barrier, these two compounds emerge as excellent candidates for the pharmacological manipulation of OXTR and AVPR1a in future behavioral experiments in titi monkeys and other primate species.

AB  - Abstract
Within the first two postnatal weeks, corticostriatal axons from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) form topographic projections that organize into characteristic bands of axon terminals in the dorsolateral striatum. Molecules regulating the development of these topographically organized projections are currently unknown. Thus, the present study investigated whether EphA receptor tyrosine kinases, which regulate axonal guidance in the visual system via axon repulsion, could participate in the formation of corticostriatal connections during development. Prior studies indicate that EphA7-expressing striatal neurons are organized into banded compartments resembling the matrisome innervation pattern formed by cortical afferents from the S1 cortex and that ephrin-A5, a known EphA7 ligand, is expressed in a medial (high) to lateral (low) gradient in S1. Thus, we hypothesized that the organization of EphA7-expressing striatal neurons in banded domains provides a repulsive barrier preventing corticostriatal axons containing EphA7-ligands from innervating inappropriate regions of the striatum. To evaluate this, we injected the anterograde tracer, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA), into two locations in medial areas of S1 (the anterior and posterior whisker fields), which are reported to express high levels of ephrin-A5 during development. Injections were made in mouse pups on postnatal day 9 (P9) and the animals were processed for immunohistochemistry on P12. Our data demonstrate that projections from both the forelimb/anterior whisker field and the posterior whisker field avoid EphA7-expressing neurons and terminate in a banded pattern in regions with very low EphA7-expression. We also determined that corticothalamic projections from medial S1 also exhibit a restricted distribution in the thalamus and avoid neurons expressing EphA7. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that the anatomical organization of striatal and thalamic neurons expressing EphA7 receptors restricts the topographic distribution of cortical afferents from medial regions of S1 which express high levels of ephrin-A5.

AB  - Abstract
Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons play a central role in a wide range of behaviors, from attention and motivation to motor control and reinforcement. The release of DA is modulated by a number of factors, and its deregulation has been implicated in multiple psychiatric disorders, such as addiction. In particular, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are key modulators of DA cells. Nicotine, the main addictive component in tobacco, strongly interacts with these receptors in the midbrain DA systems, resulting in reinforcing effects that are at the core of tobacco addiction. nAChRs are virtually expressed on every cell of the DA system, both at pre-, post- and extra-synaptic locations. The complex issue of interpreting the role of the large portfolio of different nAChR subtypes expressed on ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) neurons, and especially their role in defining functional DAergic subpopulations, is far from being solved. In this review we will try to provide the reader with an integrative view of the nicotinic modulation of DA neurons and its influence at the cellular, systemic and behavioral levels (exploratory behavior), as well as its implication in the reinforcing effects of nicotine.

AB  - Abstract
Organization of the central visual pathway is generally studied from a perspective of feedforward processes. However, there are horizontal connections and also strong feedback from extra striate to visual cortex. Here, we use visual stimuli designed to maximize relative differential involvements of these three main types of connections. The approach relies on differences between stimulation within the classical receptive field (CRF) and that of the surround region. Although previous studies have used similar approaches, they were limited primarily to spatial segregation of neural connections. Our experimental design provides clear segregation of fast and slow components of surround modulation. We assume these are mediated by feedback and horizontal connections, respectively, but other factors may be involved. Our results imply that both horizontal and feedback connections contribute to integration of visual information outside the CRF and provide suppressive or facilitative modulation. For a given cell, modulation may change in strength and sign from suppression to facilitation or the reverse depending on surround parameters. Sub-threshold input from the CRF surround increases local field potential (LFP) power in distinct frequency ranges which differ for suppression and facilitation. Horizontal connections have delayed CRF-surround modulation and are sensitive to position changes in the surround. Therefore, surround information beyond the CRF is initially processed by fast connections which we consider to be feedback, whereas spatially tuned mechanisms are relatively slow and presumably mediated by horizontal connections. Overall, results suggest that convergent fast (feedforward) inputs determine size and structure of the CRFs of recipient cells in visual cortex. And fast connections from extra striate regions (feedback) plus slow-tuned connections (horizontal) within visual cortex contribute to spatial influences of CRF surround activation.

AB  - Abstract
Brain injury causes dysfunction of the blood–brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is comprised of perivascular astrocytes whose end-feet ensheath brain microvascular endothelial cells. We investigated trauma-induced morphological changes of human astrocytes (HA) and human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3) in vitro, including the potential role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal-transduction pathways. HA or hCMEC/D3 were grown on flexible culture membranes and subjected to single traumatic injury normalized to 20%, 30% or 55% membrane deformation. Cells were assayed for morphological changes (i.e. retraction) and MAPK phosphorylation and/or expression (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, and p38). HA retraction was rapidly elicited with a single traumatic injury (55% membrane deformation; p &lt; 0.01). Morphological recovery of HA was observed within 2 h (p &lt; 0.05). Traumatic injuries increased phospho-JNK1/2 (p &lt; 0.05) in HA, indicating MAPK activation. Pre-treatment of HA with structurally distinct JNK inhibitors (25 μM), either SP600125 or SU3327, reduced JNK phosphorylation (p &lt; 0.05) and trauma-induced HA retraction (P &lt; 0.05). In contrast to HA, traumatic injury failed to induce either morphological changes or MAPK activation in hCMEC/D3. In summary, traumatic injury induces JNK-mediated HA retraction in vitro, while sparing morphological changes in cerebral microvascular endothelial cells. Astrocyte retraction from microvascular endothelial cells in vivo may occur after brain trauma, resulting in cellular uncoupling and BBB dysfunction. JNK may represent a potential therapeutic target for traumatic brain injuries.

AB  - Abstract
Depression is a mental disorder of still unknown origin. Currently, much attention is paid to the potential influence of disturbances in the functioning of neurotrophic factors on the onset of this disease. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is one of the most important growth agents affecting processes that are crucial for brain development. To date, there are no data showing the impact of prenatal stress on the family of six IGF binding proteins (IGFBP 1–6) that regulate IGF-1 bioactivity. The goal of this study was to investigate whether the decreased expression of IGF-1 in the frontal cortex (FCx) and hippocampus (Hp) of adult male rats following a prenatal stress procedure is related to changes in the IGFBP family. Our results show that rats exposed prenatally to stressful stimuli displayed depression-like behavior based on sucrose preference and elevated plus maze tests. In both cases, in the adult rat brain structures that were examined after the prenatal stress procedure, the IGF-1 protein level was reduced. Moreover, we observed changes of varying degrees in the levels of IGFBPs in stressed animals. A decrease in IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 accompanied by an increase in the IGFBP-4 concentration in the Hp and the FCx was detected. There were no differences in IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-6 brain levels between the stressed and control animals, whereas IGFBP-5 concentration was decreased in the Hp of prenatally stressed animals. This study demonstrated that stress during pregnancy may lead not only to behavioral disturbances but also to a decrease in IGF-1 level and the dysregulation of the IGF-1 binding protein network in adult rat offspring.

AB  - Abstract
Memantine (MEM) is used for improving the cognitive impairments of the patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by multiple neuroprotective mechanisms. However, it is still not clear whether nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling is involved in the mechanisms of MEM. The present study investigated the neuroprotective effects of MEM treatment on the cognitive performance and amyloidosis in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, and disclosed the NGF-related mechanism of MEM. We found that MEM treatment improved the cognitive performance by decreasing the escape latency and path length in the navigation test, by shortening the duration in target quadrant and reducing the frequency to pass through the target in probe trial, and by prolonging the latency and decreasing the frequencies of entering the dark compartment in passive avoidance test. The over-expressions of Aβ(1–42) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) were also decreased in the brains of APP/PS1 mice. Interestingly, MEM treatment improved the decreased NGF levels in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, NGF/TrkA signaling was activated by increasing the phosphorylation levels of tyrosine kinase (TrkA), proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase, Raf1 (c-Raf), extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK)1/2 and cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) after MEM treatment. Simultaneously, MEM also inhibited NGF/p75NTR signaling via decreasing the cleavage substrate of p75NTR, increasing the JNK2 phosphorylation and decreasing the levels of p53 and cleaved-caspase 3. Therefore, the dual-regulation on NGF signaling was attributed to the improvements of cognitive deficits and Aβ depositions in APP/PS1 mice. In conclusion, MEM treatment activated the NGF/TrkA signaling, and inhibited the p75NTR signaling in APP/PS1 mice to ameliorate the behavioral deficits and amyloidosis, indicating that NGF signaling was a new potential target of MEM treatment for AD therapy.

AB  - Abstract
Exposure to ethanol in utero is associated with a myriad of sequelae for the offspring. Some of these effects are morphological in nature and noticeable from birth, while others involve more subtle changes to the brain that only become apparent later in life when the individuals are challenged cognitively. One brain structure that shows both functional and structural deficits following prenatal ethanol exposure is the hippocampus. The hippocampus is composed of two interlocking gyri, the cornu ammonis (CA) and the dentate gyrus (DG), and they are differentially affected by prenatal ethanol exposure. The CA shows a more consistent loss in neuronal numbers, with different ethanol exposure paradigms, than the DG, which in contrast shows more pronounced and consistent deficits in synaptic plasticity.

In this study we show that significant deficits in adult hippocampal neurogenesis are apparent in aged animals following prenatal ethanol exposure. Deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis were not apparent in younger animals. Surprisingly, even when ethanol exposure occurred in conjunction with maternal stress, deficits in neurogenesis did not occur at this young age, suggesting that the capacity for neurogenesis is highly conserved early in life. These findings are unique in that they demonstrate for the first time that deficits in neurogenesis associated with prenatal ethanol consumption appear later in life.

AB  - Abstract
The anxiolytic diazepam selectively inhibits psychological stress-induced autonomic and behavioral responses without causing noticeable suppression of other central performances. This pharmacological property of diazepam led us to the idea that neurons that exhibit diazepam-sensitive, psychological stress-induced activation are potentially those recruited for stress responses. To obtain neuroanatomical clues for the central stress circuitries, we examined the effects of diazepam on psychological stress-induced neuronal activation in broad brain regions. Rats were exposed to a social defeat stress, which caused an abrupt increase in body temperature by up to 2 °C. Pretreatment with diazepam (4 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated the stress-induced hyperthermia, confirming an inhibitory physiological effect of diazepam on the autonomic stress response. Subsequently, the distribution of cells expressing Fos, a marker of neuronal activation, was examined in 113 forebrain and midbrain regions of these rats after the stress exposure and diazepam treatment. The stress following vehicle treatment markedly increased Fos-immunoreactive (IR) cells in most regions of the cerebral cortex, limbic system, thalamus, hypothalamus and midbrain, which included parts of the autonomic, neuroendocrine, emotional and arousal systems. The diazepam treatment significantly reduced the stress-induced Fos expression in many brain regions including the prefrontal, sensory and motor cortices, septum, medial amygdaloid nucleus, medial and lateral preoptic areas, parvicellular paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, dorsomedial hypothalamus, perifornical nucleus, tuberomammillary nucleus, association, midline and intralaminar thalami, and median and dorsal raphe nuclei. In contrast, diazepam increased Fos-IR cells in the central amygdaloid nucleus, medial habenular nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus and magnocellular lateral hypothalamus. These results provide important information for elucidating the neural circuitries that mediate the autonomic and behavioral responses to psychosocial stressors.

AB  - Abstract
Mindfulness is the state of being attentive to and aware of what is taking place in the present, which is beneficial for reducing stress-related symptoms and improving mental and physical health. Previous studies have demonstrated that meditation practice can improve individuals’ mindfulness through modifying functions and structures of multiple brain regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, fronto-limbic network, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and temporal-parietal junction. However, little is known about the neuroanatomical correlates of trait mindfulness. In the current study, we used voxel-based morphometry to investigate the neural correlates of individual differences in trait mindfulness by correlating the gray matter (GM) volume of each voxel across the whole brain with trait mindfulness measured by the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale in a large sample of young adults (N = 247). We found that individuals who were more mindful of the present had greater GM volume in the right hippocampus/amygdala and bilateral ACC, but less GM volume in bilateral PCC and the left orbitofrontal cortex. These results suggest that trait mindfulness is associated with brain regions involved in executive attention, emotion regulation, and self-referential processing, through which mindfulness may exert its beneficial effects on psychological and physical well-being.

The present study aims to identify transcription factors (TFs) contributing to angiogenesis, a mechanism involved in giving plasticity to the brain, as potential therapeutic targets after cerebral ischemia. The promoter sequences from candidate genes involved in angiogenesis were submitted to a comparative analysis by bioinformatics software. High-mobility group I-Y protein (HMGIY) TF characterization in a rat permanent focal cerebral ischemia model was performed by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot for the TF expression profile study. The TF functional study was carried out using a TF–TF interaction array and gene silencing by siRNA in rat brain microvascular endothelial cells. The results showed that the promoters shared a common TF binding site for HMGIY. The expression profile analysis in ischemic rat brain showed an increase in HMGIY mRNA in the acute phase and a progressive overexpression of protein over time post-ischemia. The interaction array analysis revealed that ischemia promotes the interaction of HMGIY with TFs involved in different cerebral plasticity processes. In vitro knockdown studies showed that angiopoietin 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor expression is controlled by HMGIY and that this TF is involved in cell survival in brain endothelial cells. These findings suggest that HMGIY is a potential therapeutic target that could promote brain repair functions after stroke.

AB  - Abstract
During chronic pain states, peripheral nociceptive stimulation can induce long-term potentiation (LTP) in the spinal dorsal horn, but it is not clear how quickly spinal LTP develops after peripheral noxious stimulation. Furthermore, transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) receptors are abundant in spinal cord dorsal horn, especially in the superficial layers, and are thought to be involved in synaptic plasticity. In this study, we investigated the time frame of LTP induction after inflammatory insult and electrical stimulation and the involvement of TRPV1 receptors. By using extracellular recordings of C-fiber-evoked field potentials in the superficial spinal dorsal horn and teased fiber recording in vivo, we found that subcutaneous injection of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) or 5% formalin induced low-frequency, irregular discharges of C-fibers and LTP of the C-fiber-evoked field potentials in the spinal dorsal horn within 3 h. Topical application of the TRPV1 receptor antagonist capsazepine onto the spinal cord inhibited the induction of spinal LTP by CFA or formalin. Furthermore, capsazepine and another TRPV1 antagonist, (E)-3-(4-t-butylphenyl)-N-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-6-yl)acrylamide, partially or completely blocked the LTP induced by conditioning stimulation with high- and low-frequency electrical stimulation. These results suggest that acute peripheral inflammatory stimulation by CFA or 5% formalin can induce spinal LTP very early after stimulation onset and that TRPV1 receptors in the spinal dorsal horn might contribute to this LTP induction.

AB  - Abstract
Depression is a worldwide disability disease associated with high morbidity and has increased dramatically in the last few years. The differential diagnosis and the definition of an individualized therapy for depression are hampered by the absence of specific biomarkers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the phospholipidomic profile of the brain and myocardium in a mouse model of depression induced by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). The lipidomic profile was evaluated by thin layer and liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry and lipid oxidation was estimated by FOX II assay. Antioxidant enzyme activity and the oxidized/reduced glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio were also evaluated. Results showed that chronic stress affects primarily the lipid profile of the brain, inducing an increase in lipid hydroperoxides, which was not detected in the myocardium. A significant decrease in phosphatidylinositol (PI) and in cardiolipin (CL) relative contents and also oxidation of CL and a significant increase of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were observed in the brain of mice after unpredictable chronic stress conditions. In the myocardium only an increase in PC content was observed. Nevertheless, both organs present a decreased GSH/GSSG ratio when compared to control groups, corroborating the occurrence of oxidative stress. The enzyme activities of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were found to be decreased in the myocardium and increased in the brain, while glutathione reductase (GR) was decreased in the brain. Our results indicate that in a mouse model for studying depression induced by CUS, the modification of the expression of oxidative stress-related enzymes did not prevent lipid oxidation in organs, particularly in the brain. These observations suggest that depression has an impact on the brain lipidome and that further studies are needed to better understand lipids role in depression and to evaluate their potential as future biomarkers.

AB  - Abstract
Local peripheral injury activates satellite glial cells (SGCs) in sensory ganglia, which may contribute to chronic pain. We hypothesized that systemic inflammation affects sensory ganglia like local injury. We induced systemic inflammation in mice by injecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intraperitoneally, and characterized SGCs and neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), using dye injection, calcium imaging, electron microscopy (EM), immunohistochemistry, and electrical recordings. Several days post-LPS, SGCs were activated, and dye coupling among SGCs increased 3–4.5-fold. EM showed abnormal growth of SGC processes and the formation of new gap junctions. Sensitivity of SGCs to ATP increased twofold, and neuronal excitability was augmented. Blocking gap junctions reduced pain behavior in LPS-treated mice. Thus, changes in DRG due to systemic inflammation are similar to those due to local injury, which may explain the pain in sickness behavior and in other systemic diseases.

AB  - Abstract
Prion disorders are associated with the conversion of normal cellular prion protein (PrPc) to the abnormal scrapie isoform of prion protein (PrPsc). Recent studies have shown that expression of normal PrPc is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), and that lactoferrin increases full-length PrPc on the cell surface. Lactoferrin is an 80-kDa iron-binding glycoprotein with various biological activities, including iron-chelating ability. HIF-1α and the associated ubiquitin–proteasome pathway are regulated by HIF prolyl-hydroxylases 2 (PHD2). We hypothesized that lactoferrin regulates PHD2 expression and enzymatic activity, and the PHD2 regulation promotes HIF-1α stability and prevention of neuronal cell death mediated by prion protein (PrP) residues (106–126). Lactoferrin prevented PrP (106–126)-induced neurotoxicity by the induction of PrPc expression via promoting HIF-1α stability in neuronal cells. Our results demonstrated that lactoferrin prevented PrP (106–126)-induced neurotoxicity via the up-regulation of HIF-1α stability determined by PHD2 expression and enzymatic activity. These findings suggest that possible therapies such as PHD2 inhibition, or promotion of lactoferrin secretion, may have clinical benefits in neurodegenerative diseases, including prion disease.

AB  - Abstract
Our lab recently showed that N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) evokes ATP-sensitive K+ (K-ATP) currents in subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons in slices of the rat brain. Both K-ATP channels and 5′-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) are considered cellular energy sensors because their activities are influenced by the phosphorylation state of adenosine nucleotides. Moreover, AMPK has been shown to regulate K-ATP function in a variety of tissues including pancreas, cardiac myocytes, and hypothalamus. We used whole-cell patch clamp recordings to study the effect of AMPK activation on K-ATP channel function in STN neurons in slices of the rat brain. We found that bath or intracellular application of the AMPK activators A769662 and PT1 augmented tolbutamide-sensitive K-ATP currents evoked by NMDA receptor stimulation. The effect of AMPK activators was blocked by the AMPK inhibitor dorsomorphin (compound C), and by STO609, an inhibitor of the upstream AMPK activator CaMKKβ. AMPK augmentation of NMDA-induced K-ATP current was also blocked by intracellular BAPTA and by inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase and guanylyl cyclase. However, A769662 did not augment currents evoked by the K-ATP channel opener diazoxide. In the presence of NMDA, A769662 inhibited depolarizing plateau potentials and burst firing, both of which could be antagonized by tolbutamide or dorsomorphin. These studies show that AMPK augments NMDA-induced K-ATP currents by a Ca2+-dependent process that involves nitric oxide and cGMP. By augmenting K-ATP currents, AMPK activation would be expected to dampen the excitatory effect of glutamate-mediated transmission in the STN.

AB  - Abstract
Humans have been consistently shown to be bad at making decisions, especially in disadvantageous situations. In this study, we designed a task that simulates real-life non-strategic gambling to examine the effect of win–lose balance situations (WIN, LOSS, TIE) on decision-making. In behavioral performances, participants showed shorter response time (RT) in LOSS than in WIN and TIE conditions. Imaging results revealed that decisions in WIN are associated with increased brain activations in the posterior cingulate cortex; decisions in LOSS are associated with increased brain activations in the insula and decreased activations in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). Positive correlation was found between brain activation in IFG and RT in LOSS. Overall, we concluded that, in disadvantageous conditions, participants are frustrated by their negative results and tend to make a random selection without full consideration. In advantageous conditions, participants’ motivations to gamble are elicited and they tend to engage in more endeavors in making decisions.

AB  - Abstract
Animal models of diabetes do not reach the severity of human diabetic neuropathy but relatively mild neurophysiological deficits and minor morphometric changes. The lack of degenerative neuropathy in diabetic rodent models seems to be a consequence of the shorter length of the axons or the shorter animal life span. Diabetes-induced demyelination needs many weeks or even months before it can be evident by morphometrical analysis. In mice myelination of the peripheral nervous system starts at the prenatal period and it is complete several days after birth. Here we induced experimental diabetes to neonatal mice and we evaluated its effect on the peripheral nerve 4 and 8 weeks after diabetes induction. Neurophysiological values showed a decline in sensory nerve conduction velocity at both time-points. Morphometrical analysis of the tibial nerve demonstrated a decrease in the number of myelinated fibers, fiber size and myelin thickness at both time-points studied. Moreover, aldose reductase and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activities were increased even if the amount of the enzyme was not affected. Thus, type 1 diabetes in newborn mice induces early peripheral neuropathy and may be a good model to assay pharmacological or gene therapy strategies to treat diabetic neuropathy.

AB  - Abstract
Following injury to a peripheral nerve the denervated distal nerve segment undergoes remarkable changes including loss of the blood–nerve barrier, Schwann cell proliferation, macrophage invasion, and the production of many cytokines and neurotrophic factors. The aggregate consequence of such changes is that the denervated nerve becomes a permissive and even preferred target for regenerating axons from the proximal nerve segment. The possible role that an original end-organ target (e.g. muscle) may play in this phenomenon during the regeneration period is largely unexplored. We used the rat femoral nerve as an in vivo model to begin to address this question. We also examined the effects of disrupting communication with muscle in terms of accuracy of regenerating motor neurons as judged by their ability to correctly project to their original terminal nerve branch. Our results demonstrate that the accuracy of regenerating motor neurons is dependent upon the denervated nerve segment remaining in uninterrupted continuity with muscle. We hypothesized that this influence of muscle on the denervated nerve might be via diffusion-driven movement of biomolecules or the active axonal transport that continues in severed axons for several days in the rat, so we devised experiments to separate these two possibilities. Our data show that disrupting ongoing diffusion-driven movement in a denervated nerve significantly reduces the accuracy of regenerating motor neurons.

AB  - Abstract
In humans the identification of the primary gustatory cortex (PGC) is still under debate. Neuroimaging studies indicate insula and overlying opercula as the best candidates but the exact position of the PGC within this region is not entirely clear. Moreover, inconsistencies appear when comparing results from studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and gustatory event-related potentials (gERP), or gustatory event-related magnetic fields (gERMF). fMRI indicates activations in the anterior part of the insula and frontal operculum, while gERP and/or gERMF indicate activations at the transition between the parietal operculum and insula in its posterior part. Here it is important to note that for gERP and gERMF temporal and spatial characteristics of the stimulus must be well controlled to evoke a useful brain response. In the present study gERMF and gERP were recorded simultaneously using a whole-head system with 249 magnetometers and 32 electrodes, respectively; taste stimuli were applied using a stimulator providing excellent temporal and spatial control of the stimulus. Separate ERP and ERMF averaged waveforms were derived time-locked to the onset of the taste stimuli. The source analysis for the early time range revealed activity in the left and right anterior and mid part of the insula, where in the later time range the sources were located more in the posterior part of the insula.

Hyperglycemia is a common phenomenon in the early phase of brain injury (BI). The management of blood glucose levels after BI, however, is subject of a growing debate. The occurrence of elevated blood glucose concentrations is linked to increased mortality and worse neurologic outcomes indicating the necessity for therapeutic glucose-lowering. Intensive glucose-lowering therapy, on the other hand, inevitably results in an increased rate of hypoglycemic episodes with detrimental effects on the injured brain. In this review, we give an overview on the current knowledge about causes and pathophysiological consequences of dysglycemia in patients with BI and offer some suggestions for clinical glucose management.

AB  - Abstract
The endogenous neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone (ALLO) has previously been shown to induce reinstatement of ethanol seeking in rodents. ALLO is a positive allosteric modulator at both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. The contribution of each class of GABAA receptors in mediating reinstatement of ethanol seeking is unknown. The first aim of the present study was to determine whether ganaxolone (GAN), a longer-acting synthetic analog of ALLO, also promotes reinstatement of ethanol seeking. The second aim was to examine whether preferentially activating extrasynaptic GABAA receptors with the selective agonist gaboxadol (THIP) was sufficient to reinstate responding for ethanol in mice. Male C57BL/6J mice were trained to lever press for access to a 10% ethanol (v/v) solution (10E), using a sucrose-fading procedure. Following extinction of the lever-pressing behavior, systemic THIP (0, 4 and 6 mg/kg) and GAN (0, 10, and 15 mg/kg) were tested for their ability to reinstate ethanol-appropriate responding in the absence of 10E access. GAN significantly increased lever pressing on the previously active lever, while THIP did not alter lever-pressing behavior. The results of this study suggest that direct activation of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors at the GABA site is not sufficient to induce ethanol seeking in the reinstatement procedure. Future studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms and brain areas by which differences in the pharmacological activity of GAN and THIP at the GABAA receptor contribute to the dissimilarity in their effect on the reinstatement of ethanol seeking. Nonetheless, based on the increased use of these drugs in clinical trials across multiple disease states, the effects of GAN or THIP on alcohol seeking may be an important consideration if these drugs are to be used clinically in a population with a co-occurring alcohol use disorder.

The midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons play a central role in developing appropriate goal-directed behaviors, including the motivation and cognition to develop appropriate actions to obtain a specific outcome. Indeed, subpopulations of DA neurons have been associated with these different functions: the mesolimbic, mesocortical, and nigrostriatal pathways. The mesolimbic and nigrostriatal pathways are an integral part of the basal ganglia through its reciprocal connections to the ventral and dorsal striatum respectively. This chapter reviews the connections of the midbrain DA cells and their role in integrating information across limbic, cognitive and motor functions. Emphasis is placed on the interface between these functional domains within the striatum through corticostriatal connections, through the striato-nigro-striatal connection, and through the lateral habenula projection to the midbrain.

AB  - Abstract
Stroke is a leading cause of death and serious, long-term disability worldwide. We report that rats receiving liraglutide show markedly attenuated infarct volumes and neurological deficit following ischemic insult. We have also investigated the effect of liraglutide on apoptosis and oxidative stress pathways after ischemic injury in diabetic and non-diabetic rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300–350 g were used. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin. Rats were pretreated with either vehicle or liraglutide (50 μg/kg, s.c.) for 14 days and thereafter subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Twenty-four hours after occlusion, rats were assessed for neurological deficit, motor function and subsequently sacrificed for estimation of infarct volume, oxidative stress and apoptotic markers. Vehicle-treated non-diabetic and diabetic rats showed significant (p &lt; 0.001) neurological deficit following cerebral ischemia. Liraglutide pretreatment resulted in significantly (p &lt; 0.001) less neurological deficit compared to vehicle-treated MCAO rats. Cerebral ischemia produced significant (p &lt; 0.0001) infarction in vehicle-treated rats; however, the infarct volume was significantly (p &lt; 0.001) less in liraglutide-pretreated rats. Oxidative stress markers were increased following ischemia but were attenuated in liraglutide-treated rats. Anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 expression was decreased and pro-apoptotic protein Bax expression was increased in vehicle-treated MCAO rats compared to sham (p &lt; 0.0001). On the other hand liraglutide pretreatment showed significantly (p &lt; 0.01) increased expression of Bcl-2 and decreased expression of Bax in MCAO rats. In vehicle-treated group, the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells significantly (p &lt; 0.0001) increased in the ischemic hemisphere compared to sham-operated group. The number of TUNEL-positive cells in vehicle group was 73.5 ± 3.3 and 85.5 ± 5.2/750 μm2 in non-diabetic and diabetic vehicle-treated MCAO rats, respectively. Following liraglutide treatment the number of TUNEL-positive cells was remarkably attenuated to 25.5 ± 2.8 and 41.5 ± 4.1/750 μm2 (p &lt; 0.001) in non-diabetic and diabetic rats, respectively. The results demonstrate that glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist, liraglutide, is a neuroprotective agent and attenuates the neuronal damage following cerebral ischemia in rats by preventing apoptosis and decreasing oxidative stress.

AB  - Abstract
Projection systems arising from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the substantia nigra (SN) have a critical role in a broad range of functions, as well as in the etiology, symptoms and treatment of neurological and psychiatric diseases. Mostly studied for its dopamine neurons, the ventral tegmentum is in fact heterogeneous at cellular and functional levels. This special issue of Neuroscience gathered some experts in the field to review the connectivity of the ventral mesencephalic dopaminergic complex, its cellular heterogeneity with attention given to glutamate neurons, the D2 autoreceptor and the cholinergic controls of dopamine activity, the influence of neurotrophins, the controls of bursting activity and the heterogeneity of neuronal activity across traits and states, the pedunculopontine tegmental and the sensory controls of dopamine activity, the sex-dependent diversity, the links between circadian and dopamine systems, the functional antero-posterior heterogeneity of the VTA and the role of its GABA tail (tVTA/rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg)), the functional heterogeneity of the VTA outputs, the place of dopamine in cortico-basal ganglia circuitry, the different roles of the D1 and D2 striatal pathways and the role of dopamine in associative learning and memory. Recent progress also highlights the need for molecular markers of functional subpopulations within the ventral tegmentum, for deeper developmental knowledge of this region, and for a single cell level of connectomic. It also raises the question of inter-individual, sex, strain and species heterogeneity, and conversely the question of data generalization in a context of human pathology models, which warrant comparative studies and translational effort.

AB  - Abstract
Physical activity has been demonstrated to diminish age-related brain volume shrinkage in several brain regions accompanied by a reduction of age-related decline in cognitive functions. Most studies investigated the impact of cardiovascular fitness or training. Other types of fitness or training are less well investigated. In addition, little is known about exercise effects on volume of the basal ganglia, which, however, are involved in motor activities and cognitive functioning. In the current study (1) we examined the relationships of individual cardiovascular and motor fitness levels with the volume of the basal ganglia (namely caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus) and selected cognitive functions (executive control, perceptual speed). (2) We investigated the effect of 12-month training interventions (cardiovascular and coordination training, control group stretching and relaxation) on the volume of the respective basal ganglia nuclei. Results revealed that motor fitness but not cardiovascular fitness was positively related with the volume of the putamen and the globus pallidus. Additionally, a moderating effect of the volume of the basal ganglia (as a whole, but also separately for putamen and globus pallidus) on the relationship between motor fitness and executive function was revealed. Coordination training increased caudate and globus pallidus volume. We provide evidence that coordinative exercise seems to be a favorable leisure activity for older adults that has the potential to improve volume of the basal ganglia.

AB  - Abstract
Subacute systemic treatment with 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) causes specific lesions in the cortex and the striatum, and Huntington’s disease behavioral phenotypes in rats. We investigated differentially expressed genes in the striatum, and examined status of a highly expressed huntingtin interacting protein, profilin 2 (Pfn2) in relation to 3-NP-induced striatal neurodegeneration, employing both in vivo animal model and in vitro primary striatal neuronal cultures. Golgi staining of 3-NP-treated rat brain revealed significantly altered dendritic spine morphology and decreased spine density in the cortex and the striatum, as compared to the control. We employed suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) method to screen differentially expressed genes during striatal neurodegeneration in these animals. Forward and reverse SSH provided a library of 188 clones, which were used for reverse northern dot blot analysis to identify greatly altered striatal-specific genes. Sequence analysis of the clones identified 23 genes, expressions of which were ⩾1.5-fold changed (16 up-regulated) in the striatum of 3-NP-treated rats. Immunoprecipitation assay showed decreased binding of Pfn2 with β-actin, the level of which remained unaffected in the striata and cortices of 3-NP-treated rats. Primary cultures of striatal glutamic acid decarboxylase-65/67 immunopositive GABAergic neurons revealed loss of co-existence of Pfn2 and β-actin in fluorescence imaging studies following 3-NP treatment for 24 h. Since Pfn2 is known to regulate dendritic spine dynamics by interacting with β-actin, the reduction in its binding affinity to Pfn2 following 3-NP neurotoxic insult, and the accompanying aberrations of the dendritic spine structure and loss of spine density in striatal neurons suggest that Pfn2 may be involved in neurodegeneration in 3-NP-treated rat model of HD.

AB  - Abstract
Non-invasive criteria determining the progress of brain healing are especially important in aging, providing a case-specific therapeutic strategy in populations with dysregulated neurorepair mechanisms. We hypothesized that temporal evolution of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of T2 tissue relaxation values correlate with neurological severity scores (NS), and provide a robust indicator of healing in the aging brain after stroke. Pre-treatment of aged rats with brain-only proton irradiation was undertaken to pre-condition the inflammatory system. Irradiation was performed 10 days prior to right middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 50 min (MCAO + Rad). Control rats included naïve (no ischemia, no radiation), irradiated-only (Rad), irradiated ischemic, or ischemic-only (MCAO). MRI and NS were obtained at 3, 14 and 28 days post-stroke. At 28 days post-stroke, immunofluorescence for visualizing blood vessels (Von Willebrand factor; vWF), neurons (neuronal nuclear antigen; NeuN), astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein; GFAP), activated microglia/macrophages (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1, Iba1), T-lymphocytes (CD3), phagocytes (ED1) and apoptotic cells (caspase-3) was assessed. We found a positive T2–NS correlation in irradiated, ischemic rats that corresponded to late-stage brain recovery. Late-stage brain recovery was characterized by improved neovascularization, formation of glio-vascular complexes (visualized by GFAP/vWF) and enhanced neuronal viability (by NeuN/caspase-3) in the peri-lesional zone. The immune response plateaued at the late stage of repair as evidenced by significantly decreased expression (41.7%) and distribution of phagocytes (phagocytic rim decreased 44.6%). We also found reduced infiltration of T-lymphocytes (CD3) in the brain and normalization of blood lymphocytes. The observed T2–NS correlations may provide a simple MRI-based criterion for recognition of regenerative brain transformation in aged patients following stroke. Selective activation of innate immunity and accelerated transition from pro-inflammatory to pro-healing macrophage phenotypes induced by localized brain irradiation is a potential mechanism for enhancing repair ability in the elderly.

AB  - Abstract
Scheduled and restricted access to a palatable snack, i.e. chocolate, elicits a brief and strong anticipatory activation and entrains brain areas related with reward and motivation. This behavioral and neuronal activation persists for more than 7 days when this protocol is interrupted, suggesting the participation of a time-keeping system. The process that initiates this anticipation may provide a further understanding of the time-keeping system underlying palatable food entrainment. The aim of this study was to analyze how this entraining protocol starts and to dissect neuronal structures that initiate a chocolate-entrained activation. We assessed the development of anticipation of 5 g of chocolate during the first 8 days of the entrainment protocol. General activity of control and chocolate-entrained rats was continuously monitored with movement sensors. Moreover, motivation to obtain the chocolate was assessed by measuring approaches and interaction responses toward a wire-mesh box containing chocolate. Neuronal activation was determined with c-Fos in reward-related brain areas. We report a progressive increase in the interaction with a box to obtain chocolate parallel to a progressive neuronal activation. A significant anticipatory activation was observed in the prefrontal cortex on day 3 of entrainment and in the nucleus accumbens on day 5, while the arcuate nucleus and pyriform cortex reached significant activation on day 8. The gradual response observed with this protocol indicates that anticipation of a rewarding food requires repetitive and predictable experiences in order to acquire a temporal estimation. We also confirm that anticipation of palatable food involves diverse brain regions.

AB  - Abstract
Hippocampal neurons must maintain control over cytosolic calcium levels, especially during development, as excitation and calcium flux are necessary for proper growth and function. But excessive calcium can lead to excitotoxic cell death. Previous work suggests that neonatal male and female hippocampal neurons regulate cytosolic calcium differently, thereby leading to differential susceptibility to excitotoxic damage. Hippocampal neurons are also exposed to gonadal hormones during development and express high levels of androgen receptors. Androgens have both neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects in adults and developing animals. The present study sought to examine the effect of androgen on cell survival after an excitatory stimulus in the developing hippocampus, and whether androgen-mediated calcium regulation was the governing mechanism. We observed that glutamate did not induce robust or sexually dimorphic apoptosis in cultured hippocampal neurons at an early neonatal time point, but did 5 days later – only in males. Further, pretreatment with the androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) protected males from apoptosis during this time, but had no effect on females. Calcium imaging of sex-specific cultures revealed that DHT decreased the peak of intracellular calcium induced by glutamate, but only in males. To determine a possible mechanism for this androgen neuroprotection and calcium regulation, we quantified three calcium regulatory proteins, plasma membrane calcium ATPase1 (PMCA1), sodium/calcium exchanger1 (NCX1), and the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (SERCA2). Surprisingly, there was no sex difference in the level of any of the three proteins. Treatment with DHT significantly decreased PMCA1 and NCX1, but increased SERCA2 protein levels in very young animals but not at a later timepoint. Taken together, these data suggest a complex interaction of sex, hormones, calcium regulation and developmental age; however androgens acting during the first week of life are implicated in regulation of hippocampal cell death and may be an underlying mechanism for sexually dimorphic apoptosis.

AB  - Abstract
Protease activated receptors (PARs) populate neurons and astrocytes in the brain. The serine protease thrombin, which activates PAR-1 during the first hours after stroke, appears to be associated with the cytotoxicity. Thrombin antagonists and PAR-1 inhibitors have been correlated with reduced cell death and behavioral protection after stroke, but no data yet support a mechanistic link between PAR-1 action and benefit. We sought to establish the essential role of PAR-1 in mediating ischemic damage. Using a short hairpin mRNA packaged with green fluorescent protein in a lentivirus vector, we knocked downPAR-1 in the medial caudate nucleus prior to rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) and in rat neurons prior to oxygen–glucose deprivation. We also compared aged PAR-1 knockout mice with aged PAR-3, PAR-4 mice and young wild-type mice in a standard MCAo model. Silencing PAR-1 significantly reduced neurological deficits, reduced endothelial barrier leakage, and decreased neuronal degeneration in vivo during MCAo. PAR-1 knock-down in the ischemic medial caudate allowed cells to survive the ischemic injury; infected cells were negative for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) and c-Fos injury markers. Primary cultured neurons infected with PAR-1 short hairpin ribonucleic acid (shRNA) showed increased neuroprotection during hypoxic/aglycemic conditions with or without added thrombin. The aged PAR-1 knockout mice showed decreased infarction and vascular disruption compared to aged controls or young wild types. We demonstrated an essential role for PAR-1 during ischemia. Silencing or removing PAR-1 significantly protected neurons and astrocytes. Further development of agents that act at PAR-1 or its downstream pathways could yield powerful stroke therapy.

AB  - Abstract
To identify molecular candidates involved in brain disabilities of Ts1Cje, a mouse model of Down syndrome (DS), we performed comparative proteomic analyses. Proteins extracted from the brains of postnatal wild-type (WT) and Ts1Cje mice were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE). No differences were detected in the proteins expressed in the whole brain between WT and Ts1Cje mice at postnatal day 0 and 3 months of age. Five spots with differential expression in the brains of Ts1Cje mice were detected by 2-DE of brain proteins from WT and Ts1Cje embryos at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5). These differentially expressed proteins in Ts1Cje embryos were identified as calcyclin-binding protein (CACYBP), nucleoside diphosphate kinase-B (NDPK-B), transketolase (TK), pyruvate kinase (PK), and 60S acidic ribosomal protein P0 (RPLP0) by peptide mass fingerprinting. CACYBP and NDPK-B were involved in cell proliferation, whereas TK and PK were associated with energy metabolism. Experiments on cell proliferation, an in vivo bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeling experiment, and immunohistochemical analysis for phospho-histone H3 (an M-phase marker) demonstrated increased numbers of BrdU-positive and M-phase cells in the ganglionic eminence. Our findings suggest that the dysregulated expression of proteins demonstrated by comparative proteomic analysis could be a factor in increased cell proliferation, which may be associated with abnormalities in DS brain during embryonic life.

AB  - Abstract
Caffeine, a methylated derivative of xanthine and widely consumed psychoactive substance, acts in several targets in the nervous system. We investigated its role in retinal explants of chick embryo analyzing the role of purinergic receptors in [3H]-GABA release induced by d-aspartate (d-asp). d-Asp increases GABA-release 4.5-fold when compared to basal levels from 13-day-old chick embryo retinal explants. Caffeine 500 μM elevated d-asp-induced GABA release in 60%. The release was inhibited in the presence of NNC-711, a GABA transporter-1 (GAT-1) blocker or by MK-801, an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist. Caffeine did not modify [3H]-GABA uptake carried out for 5, 10, 30 and 60 min and did not increase the release of d-asp or glutamate at basal or stimulated conditions. The caffeine effect was mimicked by the adenosine A1 receptor antagonist DPCPX and by the adenylyl cyclase (AC) activator forskolin. It was also blocked by the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89, tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein or by the src family kinase (SFK) inhibitor PP1. Forskolin-stimulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels were reduced in the presence of the A1 receptor agonist CHA. Western blot analysis revealed that 500 μM caffeine increased phosphoGluN2B expression levels in approximately 60% when compared to total GluN2B levels in embryonic E13 retina. The GluN2B subunit-containing NMDAR antagonist ifenprodil inhibited the caffeine effect. Our results suggest that caffeine potentiates d-asp-induced GABA release, which is mediated by GAT-1, via inhibition of adenosine A1 receptor and activation of the PKA pathway. Regulation of NMDAR by phosphorylation of GluN2B subunit by a SFK may also be involved in the effect promoted by caffeine.

AB  - Abstract
Microglia, the primary immune cells in the brain, have been implicated as the predominant cells governing inflammation-mediated neuronal damage. In response to immunological challenges such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), microglia are activated and subsequently inflammatory process is initiated as evidenced by the release of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines. Here we show that Group I metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is involved in LPS-induced microglia activation. LPS triggered a similar pattern of [Ca2+]i oscillation in N9, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mutant EOC 20, TLR4-wild-type and TLR4-deficient primary mouse microglia, suggesting that LPS-induced [Ca2+]i oscillation is independent of TLR4. The characteristics of [Ca2+]i oscillation induced by LPS are consistent with those observed in mGluR5 activation. In addition, mGluR5 antagonist 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine (MTEP) abolished LPS-induced [Ca2+]i oscillation. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that LPS colocalizes with mGluR5 in microglia and the direct binding of LPS and mGluR5 was further validated by antibody-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) technology. Activation of mGluR5 using a selective agonist (RS)-2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG) significantly expanded LPS-induced nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activity and CHPG alone increased NF-κB activity as well. But, mGluR5 antagonist MTEP attenuated the actions of LPS, CHPG and the additive effect of LPS and CHPG in microglia. LPS induced tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secretion in N9 microglia, but not in TLR4-mutant EOC 20 and TLR4-deficient primary mouse microglia. CHPG reduced LPS-caused TNF-α production, but MTEP increased LPS-induced TNF-α production and blocked the effect of CHPG in N9 microglia. These data demonstrate that mGluR5 and TLR4 are two critical receptors that mediate microglia activation in response to LPS, suggesting that mGluR5 may represent a novel target for modulating microglia-dependent neuroinflammation.

AB  - Abstract
Almost every physiological or behavioral process in mammals follows rhythmic patterns, which depend mainly on a master circadian clock located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The dopaminergic (DAergic) system in the brain is principally implicated in motor functions, motivation and drug intake. Interestingly, DA-related parameters and behaviors linked to the motivational and arousal states, show daily rhythms that could be regulated by the SCN or by extra-SCN circadian oscillator(s) modulating DAergic systems. Here we examine what is currently understood about the anatomical and functional central multi-oscillatory circadian system, highlighting how the main SCN clock communicates timing information with other brain clocks to regulate the DAergic system and conversely, how DAergic cues may have feedback effects on the SCN. These studies give new insights into the role of the brain circadian system in DA-related neurologic pathologies, such as Parkinson’s disease, attention deficit/hyperactive disorder and drug addiction.

AB  - Abstract
Sensory experience has a profound effect on neocortical neurons. Passive stimulation of whiskers or sensory deprivation from whiskers can induce long-lasting changes in neuronal responses or modify the receptive field in adult animals. We recorded barrel cortical neurons in urethane-anesthetized rats in layers 2/3 or 5/6 to determine if repetitive stimulation would induce long-lasting response facilitation. Air-puff stimulation (20-ms duration, 40 pulses at 0.5–8 Hz) was applied to a single whisker. This repetitive stimulation increased tactile responses in layers 2/3 and 5/6 for 60 min. Moreover, the functional coupling (coherence) between the sensory stimulus and the neural response also increased after the repetitive stimulation in neurons showing response facilitation. The long-lasting response facilitation was due to activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors because it was reduced by APV ((2R)-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid, (2R)-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate) and MK801 application. Inactivation of layer 2/3 also blocked response facilitation in layer 5/6, suggesting that layer 2/3 may be fundamental in this synaptic plasticity processes. Moreover, i.p. injection of eserine augmented the number of layer 2/3 neurons expressing long-lasting response facilitation; this effect was blocked by atropine, suggesting that muscarinic receptor activation favors the induction of the response facilitation. Our data indicate that physiologically repetitive stimulation of a single whisker at the frequency at which rats move their whiskers during exploration of the environment induces long-lasting response facilitation improving sensory processing.

AB  - AbstractBackground and object
Silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1) is a class III histone deacetylase and activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ co-activator-1α (PGC-1α) which attenuates oxidative damage. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) has been proven to protect the rat brain against cerebral ischemia injury by reducing oxidative stress. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the potential neuroprotection and the possible role of ALA in SIRT1 pathway.
Methods
Male CD-1 mice were randomly assigned to three groups: Sham, permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) and ALA group (ALA, 50 mg/kg). ALA was administered intraperitoneally 30 min prior to ischemia in the ALA group. Neurological deficit, infarct volume, and brain edema were detected at 24 h after cerebral ischemia. Immunohistochemistry, western blot and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were used to detect the expression of SIRT1 and PGC-1α. Activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured by assay kits.
Results
Compared with the pMCAO group, the ALA group significantly ameliorated neurological deficit, lessened infarct volume and brain edema, increased the expression of SIRT1, PGC-1α and activities of SOD (P &lt; 0.05).
Conclusions
ALA protected the mouse brain against ischemic damage, and this protection may be through up-regulating SIRT1-dependent PGC-1α expression.

AB  - Abstract
We have studied the performance of a spatial reference memory task, the navigation strategy and the changes in the cytochrome c oxidase activity (COx) in different brain regions in exercised (forced exercise, 10 consecutive days, 15 min/day) and non-exercised adult Wistar rats. The spatial learning task was carried out in the radial-arm water maze (RAWM) for four days with six daily trials, and on the fifth day, a probe session was run, in which we rotated the position of the distal cues 90° in a clockwise direction. During the four days of training, the exercised group showed shorter latency and distance traveled to find the platform, as well as fewer memory errors and reduced use of non-appropriate navigation strategies according to the protocol of the task (egocentric). Interestingly, the rotation of the cues did not affect the performance of the exercised group, in contrast to the non-exercised group, which spent more time in the center of the maze and traveled longer distance to find the platform. Finally, higher COx activity in the cingulate and the retrosplenial cortices, as well as in the dorsal CA1 and CA3 was found in the exercised group. All in all, it seems that the exercise favored the configuration of an efficient and accurate cognitive map of the environment, which was supported by our finding that the rotation of the cues, without altering their overall configuration, did not affect performance. The brain regions with higher COx activity in the exercised group seem to be involved in this function.

AB  - Abstract
Spatial memory retrieval and hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) are impaired by stress. KCNQ/Kv7 channels are closely associated with memory and the KCNQ/Kv7 channel activator flupirtine represents neuroprotective effects. This study aims to test whether KCNQ/Kv7 channel activation prevents acute stress-induced impairments of spatial memory retrieval and hippocampal LTP. Rats were placed on an elevated platform in the middle of a bright room for 30 min to evoke acute stress. The expression of KCNQ/Kv7 subunits was analyzed at 1, 3 and 12 h after stress by Western blotting. Spatial memory was examined by the Morris water maze (MWM) and the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) in the hippocampal CA1 area was recorded in vivo. Acute stress transiently decreased the expression of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 in the hippocampus. Acute stress impaired the spatial memory retrieval and hippocampal LTP, the KCNQ/Kv7 channel activator flupirtine prevented the impairments, and the protective effects of flupirtine were blocked by XE-991 (10,10-bis(4-Pyridinylmethyl)-9(10H)-anthracenone), a selective KCNQ channel blocker. Furthermore, acute stress decreased the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) at Ser9 in the hippocampus, and flupirtine inhibited the reduction. These results suggest that the KCNQ/Kv7 channels may be a potential target for protecting both hippocampal synaptic plasticity and spatial memory retrieval from acute stress influences.

AB  - Abstract
P450 metabolic enzymes are expressed in the human and rodent brain. Recent data support their involvement in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. However, the determinants of metabolic enzyme expression in the epileptic brain are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that status epilepticus (SE) or exposure to phenytoin or phenobarbital affects brain expression of the metabolic enzyme CYP2E1.

SE was induced in C57BL/6J mice by systemic kainic acid. Brain CYP2E1 expression was evaluated 18–24 h after severe SE by immunohistochemistry. Co-localization with neuronal nuclei (NEUN), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and CD31 was determined by confocal microscopy. The effect of phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital on CYP2E1 expression was evaluated in vivo or by using organotypic hippocampal cultures in vitro. CYP2E1 expression was investigated in brain resections from a cohort of drug-resistant epileptic brain resections and human endothelial cultures (EPI-EC).

Immunohistochemistry showed an increase of CYP2E1 expression limited to hippocampal CA2/3 and hilar neurons after severe SE in mice. CYP2E1 expression was also observed at the astrocyte-vascular interface. Analysis of human brain specimens revealed CYP2E1 expression in neurons and vascular endothelial cells (EC). CYP2E1 was expressed in cultured human EC and over-expressed by EPI-EC. When analyzing the effect of drug exposure on CYP2E1 expression we found that, in vivo or in vitro, ethanol increased CYP2E1 levels in the brain and liver. Treatment with phenytoin induced localized CYP2E1 expression in the brain whereas no significant effects were exerted by carbamazepine or phenobarbital.

Our data indicate that the effect of acute SE on brain CYP2E1 expression is localized and cell specific. Exposure to selected anti-epileptic drugs could play a role in determining CYP2E1 brain expression. Additional investigation is required to fully reproduce the culprits of P450 enzyme expression as observed in the human epileptic brain.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic stress is an established risk factor in the development of addiction. Addiction is characterized by a progressive transition from casual drug use to habitual and compulsive drug use. The ability of chronic stress to facilitate the transition to addiction may be mediated by increased engagement of the neurocircuitries underlying habitual behavior and addiction. In the present study, striatal morphology was evaluated after 2 weeks of chronic variable stress in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Dendritic complexity of medium spiny neurons was visualized and quantified with Golgi staining in the dorsolateral and dorsomedial striatum, as well as in the nucleus accumbens core and shell. In separate cohorts, the effects of chronic stress on habitual behavior and the acute locomotor response to methamphetamine were also assessed. Chronic stress resulted in increased dendritic complexity in the dorsolateral striatum and nucleus accumbens core, regions implicated in habitual behavior and addiction, while decreased complexity was found in the nucleus accumbens shell, a region critical for the initial rewarding effects of drugs of abuse. Chronic stress did not affect dendritic complexity in the dorsomedial striatum. A parallel shift toward habitual learning strategies following chronic stress was also identified. There was an initial reduction in acute locomotor response to methamphetamine, but no lasting effect as a result of chronic stress exposure. These findings suggest that chronic stress may facilitate the recruitment of habit- and addiction-related neurocircuitries through neuronal restructuring in the striatum.

AB  - Abstract
Previous work has shown a reduction of apical dendritic length and spine density in neurons from the CA1 hippocampus subfield of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). These abnormalities are prevented by treatment for 2 weeks with 17β-estradiol. In view of the fact that diabetes and hypertension are comorbid diseases, we have now studied the effect of Streptozotocin-induced diabetes on the dendritic tree and spines of CA1 hippocampus neurons, and also compared the regulation of these parameters by 17β-estradiol in diabetic and normoglycemic SHR. Twenty-week-old male SHR received iv 40-mg/kg Streptozotocin or vehicle and studied 1 month afterward. A group of normoglycemic and hyperglycemic SHR also received sc a single 17β-estradiol pellet or vehicle for 2 weeks. Hippocampus sections were impregnated with silver nitrate following a modified Golgi’s method and the arbor of CA1 pyramidal neurons analyzed by Sholl’s method. 17β-Estradiol treatment of normoglycemic SHR reversed the reduced length of apical dendrites, the low spine density and additionally decreased blood pressure (BP). Diabetic SHR showed increased length of apical and basal dendrites but reduced spine density compared to normoglycemic SHR. Diabetes also decreased BP of SHR. Treatment with 17β-estradiol of diabetic SHR enhanced dendritic length, increased dendritic spine density and further decreased BP. Thus, changes of cytoarchitecture of CA1 neurons due to 17β-estradiol treatment of normoglycemic SHR persisted after diabetes induction. A decrease of BP may also contribute to the central effects of 17β-estradiol in SHR diabetic rats.

It has been half a century since brain volume enlargement was first reported in animals reared in an enriched environment (EE). As EE animals show improved memory task performance, exposure to EE has been a useful model system for studying the effects of experience on brain plasticity. We review EE-induced neural changes in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus focusing mainly on works published in the recent decade. The review is organized in three large domains of changes: anatomical, electrophysiological, and molecular changes. Finally, we discuss open issues and future outlook toward better understanding of EE-induced neural changes.

AB  - Abstract
Withdrawal from amphetamine is associated with increased anxiety and sensitivity to stressors which are thought to contribute to relapse. Rats undergoing amphetamine withdrawal fail to exhibit stress-induced increases in serotonin (5-HT) release in the ventral hippocampus and show heightened anxiety-like behaviors. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that reducing 5-HT levels in the ventral hippocampus is a causal mechanism in increasing anxiety-like behaviors during amphetamine withdrawal. First, we tested whether reducing 5-HT levels in the ventral hippocampus directly increases anxiety behavior. Male rats were bilaterally infused with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) into the ventral hippocampus, which produced a 83% decrease in ventral hippocampus 5-HT content, and were tested on the elevated plus maze (EPM) for anxiety-like behavior. Reducing ventral hippocampus 5-HT levels decreased the time spent in the open arms of the maze, suggesting that diminished ventral hippocampus 5-HT levels increases anxiety-like behavior. Next, we tested whether increasing 5-HT levels in the ventral hippocampus reverses anxiety behavior exhibited by rats undergoing amphetamine withdrawal. Rats were treated daily with either amphetamine (2.5-mg/kg, i.p.) or saline for 2 weeks, and at 2 weeks withdrawal, were infused with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor paroxetine (0.5 μM) bilaterally into the ventral hippocampus and tested for anxiety-like behavior on the EPM. Rats pre-treated with amphetamine exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior on the EPM. This effect was reversed by ventral hippocampus infusion of paroxetine. Our results suggest that 5-HT levels in the ventral hippocampus are critical for regulating anxiety behavior. Increasing 5-HT levels during withdrawal may be an effective strategy for reducing anxiety-induced drug relapse.

AB  - Abstract
In certain forms of nerve injury and inflammation, noradrenaline augments pain via actions on up-regulated α1-adrenoceptors (α1-ARs). The aim of this study was to use immunohistochemistry to examine α1-AR expression on peripheral neurons, cutaneous blood vessels and keratinocytes after distal tibia fracture and cast immobilization, a model of complex regional pain syndrome type 1. We hypothesized that there would be increased α1-AR expression on neurons and keratinocytes in the injured limb in comparison to the contralateral unaffected limb after distal tibia fracture, in association with inflammatory changes and pain. α1-AR expression was increased on plantar keratinocytes, dermal blood vessels and peripheral nerve fibers at 16 weeks after injury both in the fractured and contralateral uninjured limb. Similar changes were seen in controls whose limb had been immobilized in a cast for 4 weeks but not fractured. Neurofilament 200 (NF200), a marker of myelinated neurons, and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide involved in neuro-inflammatory signaling, decreased 4 weeks after fracture and casting but then increased at the 16-week time point. As some of these changes were also detected in the contralateral hind limb, they probably were triggered by a systemic response to fracture and casting. Soon after the cast was removed, intraplantar injections of the α1-AR antagonist prazosin released local vasoconstrictor tone but had no effect on pain behaviors. However, systemic injection of prazosin inhibited behavioral signs of pain, suggesting that fracture and/or casting triggered an up-regulation of α1-ARs in central nociceptive pathways that augmented pain. Together, these findings indicate that α1-AR expression increases in the hind limbs after distal tibia fracture and cast immobilization. However, these peripheral increases do not contribute directly to residual pain.

AB  - Abstract
Remifentanil administration may subsequently cause paradoxical hyperalgesia in animals and humans, but mechanisms remain unclear. Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) nitration and inactivation caused by generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are involved in the induction and maintenance of central neuropathic pain. Hydrogen which selectively removes superoxide has gained much attention in recent years. In this study, we investigated antinociceptive effects of hydrogen-rich saline (HRS) on remifentanil-induced postsurgical hyperalgesia in a rat model of incisional pain. HRS was injected intraperitoneally 10 min before remifentanil infusion (1 μg kg−1 min−1 for 60 min). A selective NR2B antagonist Ro25-6981 was used to investigate whether antihypernociception of HRS is associated with NMDA receptor (NMDAR). Nociception was evaluated by the paw withdrawal mechanical threshold and thermal latency respectively. Then we assessed MnSOD, NR2A and NR2B in spinal cord dorsal horn via Western blot and immunohistochemistry after nociceptive tests. Here, we found that the analgesic effect of remifentanil was followed by long-term hyperalgesia lasting at least postoperative 7 days, which was accompanied with increase in NR2B expression and trafficking from cytoplasm to surface and MnSOD nitration in dorsal horn. Pretreatment with HRS (10 ml/kg) significantly attenuated mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia, blocked NR2B trafficking and MnSOD nitration in dorsal horn after remifentanil infusion. Ro25-6981 not 5 μg but 10 and 50 μg dosage-dependently attenuated hyperalgesia, and inhibited MnSOD nitration. Hyperalgesia and MnSOD nitration were attenuated after the combination of HRS (2.5 ml/kg) and Ro25-6981 (5 μg). In conclusion, HRS (10 ml/kg) might reverse remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia, through regulating NR2B-containing NMDAR trafficking to control MnSOD nitration and enhance MnSOD activity.

In the present study we investigated the effects of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the auditory cortex (AC) on the perception of rapidly changing acoustic cues. For this purpose, in 15 native German speakers the left or right AC was separately stimulated while participants performed a between-channel gap detection task. Results show that stimulation of the left but not right AC deteriorated the auditory perception of rapidly changing acoustic information. Our data indicate a left hemispheric dominance for the processing of rapid temporal cues in auditory non-speech sounds. Moreover, we demonstrate the ability of non-invasive brain stimulation to change human temporal information processing in the auditory domain.

AB  - Abstract
Eugenol is a bioactive plant extract used as an analgesic agent in dentistry. The structural similarity of eugenol to cinnamaldehyde, an active ligand for transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), suggests that eugenol might produce its effect via TRPA1, in addition to TRPV1 as we reported previously. In this study, we investigated the effect of eugenol on TRPA1, by fura-2-based calcium imaging and patch clamp recording in trigeminal ganglion neurons and in a heterologous expression system. As the result, eugenol induced robust calcium responses in rat trigeminal ganglion neurons that responded to a specific TRPA1 agonist, allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), and not to capsaicin. Capsazepine, a TRPV1 antagonist failed to inhibit eugenol-induced calcium responses in AITC-responding neurons. In addition, eugenol response was observed in trigeminal ganglion neurons from TRPV1 knockout mice and human embryonic kidney 293 cell lines that express human TRPA1, which was inhibited by TRPA1-specific antagonist HC-030031. Eugenol-evoked TRPA1 single channel activity and eugenol-induced TRPA1 currents were dose-dependent with EC50 of 261.5 μM. In summary, these results demonstrate that the activation of TRPA1 might account for another molecular mechanism underlying the pharmacological action of eugenol.

AB  - Abstract
It is important to clarify the neural mechanisms underlying fatigue sensation. There have been several studies which identified brain regions in which the level of the neural activities was correlated with the subjective level of fatigue. However, the neural activity evoked when we evaluate our level of fatigue may not be related to the subjective level of fatigue. Thus, we tried to identify the neural activities caused by the evaluation of the level of fatigue, which may not be related to the subjective level of fatigue. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure neural activity in 10 healthy participants enrolled in our study. During MEG recordings, participants were asked to evaluate the level of physical fatigue in their right hand in time with execution cues (evaluation session) or to direct attention to their right hand in time with execution cues (control session). Equivalent current dipole (ECD) analysis was performed to localize the neural activity limited to the evaluation session. In the evaluation session, ECDs with mean latencies of approximately 380 ms were observed in nine of 10 participants. These were localized in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), while in the control session, the ECDs in the same brain region were observed in only two of 10 participants. The proportion of participants in whom ECDs were observed in the PCC in the evaluation session was significantly higher than that in the control session (McNemar test). In addition, the intensities of the ECDs were positively associated with the extent to which the participants successfully evaluated the fatigue in their right hand in the evaluation session. These data suggest that the PCC is involved in the neural substrates associated with self-evaluation of physical fatigue.

AB  - Abstract
Precise regulation of the chloride homeostasis crucially determines the action of inhibitory transmitters GABA and glycine and thereby endows neurons or even discrete neuronal compartments with distinct physiological responses to the same transmitters. In mammals, the signaling mediated by GABAA/glycine receptors shifts during early postnatal life from depolarization to hyperpolarization, due to delayed maturation of the chloride homeostasis system. While the activity of the secondary active, K+-Cl−-extruding cotransporter KCC2, renders GABA/glycine hyperpolarizing in auditory brainstem nuclei of altricial rodents, the mechanisms contributing to the initially depolarizing transmembrane gradient for Cl− in respective neurons remained unknown. Here we used gramicidin-perforated patch recordings, non-invasive Cl− and Ca2+ imaging, and immunohistochemistry to identify the Cl−-loading transporter that renders depolarizing effects of GABA/glycine in early postnatal life of spherical bushy cells in the cochlear nucleus of gerbil. Our data identify the 1Na+:1K+:2Cl− cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) as the major Cl−-loader responsible for depolarizing action of GABA/glycine at postnatal days 3–5 (P3–5). Extracellular GABA/muscimol elicited calcium signaling through R-, L-, and T-type channels, which was dependent on bumetanide- and [Na+]e-sensitive Cl− accumulation. The “adult like”, low intracellular Cl− concentration is established during the second postnatal week, through a mechanism engaging the NKCC1-down regulation between P5 and P15 and ongoing KCC2-mediated Cl−-extrusion.

AB  - Abstract
Regeneration in the adult mammalian spinal cord is limited due to intrinsic properties of mature neurons and a hostile environment, mainly provided by central nervous system myelin and reactive astrocytes. Recent results indicate that propriospinal connections are a promising target for intervention to improve functional recovery. To study this functional regeneration in vitro we developed a model consisting of two organotypic spinal cord slices placed adjacently on multi-electrode arrays. The electrodes allow us to record the spontaneously occurring neuronal activity, which is often organized in network bursts. Within a few days in vitro (DIV), these bursts become synchronized between the two slices due to the formation of axonal connections. We cut them with a scalpel at different time points in vitro and record the neuronal activity 3 weeks later. The functional recovery ability was assessed by calculating the percentage of synchronized bursts between the two slices. We found that cultures lesioned at a young age (7–9 DIV) retained the high regeneration ability of embryonic tissue. However, cultures lesioned at older ages (&gt;19 DIV) displayed a distinct reduction of synchronized activity. This reduction was not accompanied by an inability for axons to cross the lesion site. We show that functional regeneration in these old cultures can be improved by increasing the intracellular cAMP level with Rolipram or by placing a young slice next to an old one directly after the lesion. We conclude that co-cultures of two spinal cord slices are an appropriate model to study functional regeneration of intraspinal connections.

AB  - Abstract
Developing new strategies to treat cerebral ischemic–reperfusion injury will require a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie vascular permeability. In this study we examined the temporal expression of Src and angiogenic factors in rat brain after focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion and analyzed the relationships among those factors. We also investigated the effect of Src inhibitor PP1 (4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine) in ischemic reperfusion. Rats were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion for 90 min followed by reperfusion with or without PP1 treatment. Src mRNA increased at 3 h after reperfusion and then gradually declined. Phosphorylation of Src at Y418 displayed a biphasic increase. Phosphorylation increased as early as 3 h and peaked at 6 h; after decreasing, it peaked again at 3–7 days. Increases in Src mRNA and phosphorylation correlated positively with levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), and negatively with levels of angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Changes in the expression of these factors correlated with the progress of vascular permeability, especially early after reperfusion. Hence, dynamic temporal changes in Src Y418 phosphorylation may modulate vascular permeability after cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. PP1 effectively decreased Src Y418 phosphorylation and the expression of VEGF and Ang-2 and increased the expression of Ang-1 and ZO-1. It also reduced cerebral infarct size and neurologic dysfunction. Therefore, Src may represent a new therapeutic target for reducing tissue damage caused by increased vascular permeability.

AB  - Abstract
The aim of this study was to quantitatively assess the effects of short-term intermittent ethanol intoxication on cerebral metabolite changes among sham controls (CNTL), low-dose ethanol (LDE)-exposed, and high-dose ethanol (HDE)-exposed rats, which were determined with ex vivo high-resolution spectra. Eight-week-old male Wistar rats were divided into three groups. Twenty rats in the LDE (n = 10) and the HDE (n = 10) groups received ethanol doses of 1.5 and 2.5 g/kg, respectively, through oral gavage every 8 h for 4 days. At the end of the 4-day intermittent ethanol exposure, one-dimensional ex vivo 500-MHz 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were acquired from 30 samples of the frontal cortex region (from the three groups). Normalized total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA: NAA + NAAG [N-acetylaspartyl-glutamate]), GABA, and glutathione (GSH) levels were significantly lower in the frontal cortex of the HDE-exposed rats than that of the LDE-exposed rats. Moreover, compared to the CNTL group, the LDE rats exhibited significantly higher normalized GABA levels. The six pairs of normalized metabolite levels were positively (+) or negatively (−) correlated in the rat frontal cortex as follows: tNAA and GABA (+), tNAA and aspartate (Asp) (+), myo-Inositol (mIns) and Asp (−), mIns and alanine (+), mIns and taurine (+), and mIns and tNAA (−). Our results suggested that short-term intermittent ethanol intoxication might result in neuronal degeneration and dysfunction, changes in the rate of GABA synthesis, and oxidative stress in the rat frontal cortex. Our ex vivo 1H high-resolution magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy results suggested some novel metabolic markers for the dose-dependent influence of short-term intermittent ethanol intoxication in the frontal cortex.

AB  - Abstract
Some evidence has shown an increased number of activated microglial cells in patients with schizophrenia. It is hypothesized that activated microglia may contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. We injected saline or Granulocyte–Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (GM-CSF) into the ventral hippocampus in adult Sprague–Dawley rats via micro-pump; at the same time, the rats were intragastrically administrated with saline or minocycline once a day for 14 consecutive days. Then, behavioral tests were examined and microglia were assessed using immunohistochemistry method. GM-CSF-injected group showed significant behavioral deficits (hyperlocomotion, social interaction deficits, prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficits). There was a dramatic increase of the number of activated microglial cells in the hippocampus and other brain regions such as cerebral cortex and thalamus compared with those in saline-injected group in immunohistochemistry. Minocycline was able to ameliorate deficits of social interaction and PPI but not hyperlocomotion. Minocycline was also able to inhibit the microglial activation. In conclusion, intrahippocampal administration of GM-CSF in adult rats may serve as a potential schizophrenia animal model, which may be related with the microglia hypothesis of schizophrenia.

AB  - Abstract
Dopaminergic neurons in a range of species are responsive to sensory stimuli. In the anesthetized preparation, responses to non-noxious and noxious sensory stimuli are usually tonic in nature, although long-duration changes in activity have been reported in the awake preparation as well. However, in the awake preparation, short-latency, phasic changes in activity are most common. These phasic responses can occur to unconditioned aversive and non-aversive stimuli, as well as to the stimuli which predict them. In both the anesthetized and awake preparations, not all dopaminergic neurons are responsive to sensory stimuli, however responsive neurons tend to respond to more than a single stimulus modality. Evidence suggests that short-latency sensory information is provided to dopaminergic neurons by relatively primitive subcortical structures – including the midbrain superior colliculus for vision and the mesopontine parabrachial nucleus for pain and possibly gustation. Although short-latency visual information is provided to dopaminergic neurons by the relatively primitive colliculus, dopaminergic neurons can discriminate between complex visual stimuli, an apparent paradox which can be resolved by the recently discovered route of information flow through to dopaminergic neurons from the cerebral cortex, via a relay in the colliculus. Given that projections from the cortex to the colliculus are extensive, such a relay potentially allows the activity of dopaminergic neurons to report the results of complex stimulus processing from widespread areas of the cortex. Furthermore, dopaminergic neurons could acquire their ability to reflect stimulus value by virtue of reward-related modification of sensory processing in the cortex. At the forebrain level, sensory-related changes in the tonic activity of dopaminergic neurons may regulate the impact of the cortex on forebrain structures such as the nucleus accumbens. In contrast, the short latency of the phasic responses to sensory stimuli in dopaminergic neurons, coupled with the activation of these neurons by non-rewarding stimuli, suggests that phasic responses of dopaminergic neurons may provide a signal to the forebrain which indicates that a salient event has occurred (and possibly an estimate of how salient that event is). A stimulus-related salience signal could be used by downstream systems to reinforce behavioral choices.

High fructose intake is associated with increased plasma triglyceride concentration, hepatic steatosis, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and high blood pressure. In addition, increased fructose intake has recently been supposed to be a risk factor for dementia. However, direct effects of fructose on the brain function remain to be clarified. The localization of glucose transporter 5 (Glut5), a representative transporter of fructose, was immunohistochemically examined in the brains of humans, rats, and mice to clarify whether fructose was transported from the blood into the brain. Glut5 immunoreactivity was demonstrated to be located in the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus and the ependymal cells in the brains of humans and rats using commercial antibodies for Glut5. In addition, mRNA expression of mouse Glut5 was confirmed in the brains of mice. Immunohistochemical examination using a custom-made antibody against two regions of amino acid sequences of mouse Glut5 revealed that Glut5 immunoreactivity was also seen in the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus and the ependymal cells in the brains of mice. These findings show that Glut5 immunoreactivity is located in the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus and the ependymal cells, suggesting the possibility of the direct transportation of intravascular fructose into the brain parenchyma.

AB  - Abstract
We have shown previously that the netrin-1 receptor, unc-5 homologue C (UNC5C), is expressed by ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons of rodents, but only from adolescence onwards (Manitt et al., 2010; Auger et al., 2013). The goal of this study was to characterize the expression of UNC5C by these neurons. Specifically, we assessed whether UNC5C expression is selective to DA neurons that project to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which undergo significant maturation during the adolescent period. To this end, we injected fluorescent retrograde tracer beads into the mPFC, nucleus accumbens (NAcc) core, or NAcc lateral shell of adult male wild-type C57Bl/6J mice and processed their brains for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and UNC5C immunofluorescence 2–3 weeks later. VTA neurons with any combination of these immunolabels were visualized and counted using optical fractionator stereology. Our analysis revealed two main findings: (1) there are no differences in the proportions of UNC5C-positive DA neurons projecting to the mPFC, NAcc core, or NAcc lateral shell, and (2) the proportion of non-DA UNC5C-positive neurons targeting the mPFC is greater than the proportions of non-DA UNC5C-positive neurons targeting the NAcc core or lateral shell. These findings show that, contrary to our hypothesis, DA neurons projecting to the mPFC do not express UNC5C selectively. However, UNC5C expression by non-DA VTA neurons is predominantly found in those projecting to the mPFC and, as such, may play a role in their function.

μ-Opioid receptor (μ-OR) activation with agonist [D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) induces sodium (0.3 M NaCl) intake in rats. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of pre-injections of losartan (AT1 angiotensin receptor antagonist) into the CeA on 0.3 M NaCl and water intake induced by DAMGO injected bilaterally in the same area in rats submitted to water deprivation–partial rehydration (WD–PR) and in rats treated with the diuretic furosemide (FURO) combined with a low dose of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (CAP) injected subcutaneously (FURO/CAP). Male Sprague–Dawley rats with stainless steel cannulas implanted bilaterally into the CeA were used. In WD–PR rats, bilateral injections of DAMGO (2 nmol in 0.5 μL) into the CeA induced 0.3 M NaCl and water intake, and pre-treatment with losartan (108 nmol in 0.5 μL) injected into the CeA reduced 0.3 M NaCl and water intake induced by DAMGO. In FURO/CAP rats, pre-treatment with losartan (108 nmol in 0.5 μL) injected into the CeA attenuated the increase in 0.3 M NaCl and water intake induced by DAMGO (2 nmol in 0.5 μL) injected into the same site. The results suggest that the natriorexigenic effect of DAMGO injected into the CeA is facilitated by endogenous angiotensin II acting on AT1 receptors in the CeA, which drives rats to ingest large amounts of hypertonic NaCl.

AB  - Abstract
Binge eating, a central feature of multiple eating disorders, is characterized by excessive consumption occurring during discrete, often brief, intervals. Highly palatable foods play an important role in these binge episodes – foods chosen during bingeing are typically higher in fat or sugar than those normally consumed. Multiple lines of evidence suggest a central role for signaling by endogenous opioids in promoting palatability-driven eating. This role extends to binge-like feeding studied in animal models, which is reduced by administration of opioid antagonists. However, the neural circuits and specific opioid receptors mediating these effects are not fully understood. In the present experiments, we tested the hypothesis that endogenous opioid signaling in the nucleus accumbens promotes consumption in a model of binge eating. We used an anticipatory contrast paradigm in which separate groups of rats were presented sequentially with 4% sucrose and then either 20% or 0% sucrose solutions. In rats presented with 4% and then 20% sucrose, daily training in this paradigm produced robust intake of 20% sucrose, preceded by learned hypophagia during access to 4% sucrose. We tested the effects of site-specific infusions of naltrexone (a nonspecific opioid receptor antagonist: 0, 1, 10, and 50 μg/side in the nucleus accumbens core and shell), naltrindole (a delta opioid receptor antagonist: 0, 0.5, 5, and 10 μg/side in the nucleus accumbens shell) and beta-funaltrexamine (a mu opioid receptor antagonist: 0 and 2.5 μg/side in the nucleus accumbens shell) on consumption in this contrast paradigm. Our results show that signaling through the mu opioid receptor in the nucleus accumbens shell is dynamically modulated during formation of learned food preferences, and promotes binge-like consumption of palatable foods based on these learned preferences.

AB  - Abstract
The central integration of thermal (i.e. cold) and mechanical (i.e. pressure) sensory afferents is suggested as to underpin the perception of skin wetness. However, the role of temperature and mechanical inputs, and their interaction, is still unclear. Also, it is unknown whether this intra-sensory interaction changes according to the activity performed or the environmental conditions. Hence, we investigated the role of peripheral cold afferents, and their interaction with tactile afferents, in the perception of local skin wetness during rest and exercise in thermo-neutral and warm environments. Six cold-dry stimuli, characterized by decreasing temperatures [i.e. −4, −8 and −15 °C below the local skin temperature (Tsk)] and by different mechanical pressures [i.e. low pressure (LP): 7 kPa; high pressure (HP): 10 kPa], were applied on the back of 8 female participants (age 21 ± 1 years), while they were resting or cycling in 22 or 33 °C ambient temperature. Mean and local Tsk, thermal and wetness perceptions were recorded during the tests. Cold-dry stimuli produced drops in Tsk with cooling rates in a range of 0.06–0.4 °C/s. Colder stimuli resulted in increasing coldness and in stimuli being significantly more often perceived as wet, particularly when producing skin cooling rates of 0.18 °C/s and 0.35 °C/s. However, when stimuli were applied with HP, local wetness perceptions were significantly attenuated. Wetter perceptions were recorded during exercise in the warm environment. We conclude that thermal inputs from peripheral cutaneous afferents are critical in characterizing the perception of local skin wetness. However, the role of these inputs might be modulated by an intra-sensory interaction with the tactile afferents. These findings indicate that human sensory integration is remarkably multimodal.

AB  - Abstract
The intrinsic properties of spherical neurons play a fundamental role in the sensory processing of self-generated signals along a fast electrosensory pathway in electric fish. Previous results indicate that the spherical neuron’s intrinsic properties depend mainly on the presence of two resonant currents that tend to clamp the voltage near the resting potential. Here we show that these are: a low-threshold potassium current blocked by 4-aminopyridine and a mixed cationic current blocked by cesium chloride. We also show that the low-threshold potassium current also causes the long refractory period, explaining the necessary properties that implement the dynamic filtering of the self-generated signals previously described. Comparative data from other fish and from the auditory system indicate that other single spiking onset neurons might differ in the channel repertoire observed in the spherical neurons of Gymnotus omarorum.

AB  - Abstract
Supplementation with omega-3 has been identified as an adjunctive alternative for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, in order to minimize symptoms. Considering the lack of understanding concerning the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, the present study hypothesized that omega 3 prevents the onset of symptoms similar to schizophrenia in young Wistar rats submitted to ketamine treatment. Moreover, the role of oxidative stress in this model was assessed. Omega-3 (0.8 g/kg) or vehicle was given by orogastric gavage once daily. Both treatments were performed during 21 days, starting at the 30th day of life in young rats. After 14 days of treatment with omega-3 or vehicle, a concomitant treatment with saline or ketamine (25 mg/kg ip daily) was started and maintained until the last day of the experiment. We evaluated the pre-pulse inhibition of the startle reflex, activity of antioxidant systems and damage to proteins and lipids. Our results demonstrate that supplementation of omega-3 prevented: decreased inhibition of startle reflex, damage to lipids in the hippocampus and striatum and damage to proteins in the prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, these changes are associated with decreased GPx in brain tissues evaluated. Together, our results suggest the prophylactic role of omega-3 against the outcome of symptoms associated with schizophrenia.

AB  - Abstract
Cognition arises as a result of coordinated processing among distributed brain regions and disruptions to communication within these neural networks can result in cognitive dysfunction. Cortical disconnection may thus contribute to the declines in some aspects of cognitive functioning observed in healthy aging. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is ideally suited for the study of cortical disconnection as it provides indices of structural integrity within interconnected neural networks. The current review summarizes results of previous DTI aging research with the aim of identifying consistent patterns of age-related differences in white matter integrity, and of relationships between measures of white matter integrity and behavioral performance as a function of adult age. We outline a number of future directions that will broaden our current understanding of these brain–behavior relationships in aging. Specifically, future research should aim to (1) investigate multiple models of age–brain–behavior relationships; (2) determine the tract-specificity versus global effect of aging on white matter integrity; (3) assess the relative contribution of normal variation in white matter integrity versus white matter lesions to age-related differences in cognition; (4) improve the definition of specific aspects of cognitive functioning related to age-related differences in white matter integrity using information processing tasks; and (5) combine multiple imaging modalities (e.g., resting-state and task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging; fMRI) with DTI to clarify the role of cerebral white matter integrity in cognitive aging.

AB  - Abstract
Despite the enormous public health impact of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), no disease-modifying treatment has yet been proven to be efficacious in humans. A rate-limiting step in the discovery of potential therapies for humans is the absence of efficient non-invasive methods of evaluating drugs in animal models of disease. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) provides a non-invasive way to evaluate the animals at baseline, at the end of treatment, and serially to better understand treatment effects. In this study, MRS was assessed as potential outcome measure for detecting disease modification in a transgenic mouse model of AD. Passive immunization with two different antibodies, which have been previously shown to reduce plaque accumulation in transgenic AD mice, was used as intervention. Treatment effects were detected by MRS, and the most striking finding was attenuation of myo-inositol (mIns) increases in APP-PS1 mice with both treatments. Additionally, a dose-dependent effect was observed with one of the treatments for mIns. MRS appears to be a valid in vivo measure of anti-Aβ therapeutic efficacy in pre-clinical studies. Because it is noninvasive, and can detect treatment effects, use of MRS-based endpoints could substantially accelerate drug discovery.

AB  - Abstract
Sensory input from the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) to neurons in superficial laminae at the spinomedullary (Vc/C1–2) region is strongly influenced by estrogen status. This study determined if GABAergic mechanisms play a role in estrogen modulation of TMJ nociceptive processing in ovariectomized female rats treated with high- (HE) or low-dose (LE) estradiol (E2) for 2 days. Superficial laminae neurons were activated by ATP (1 mM) injections into the joint space. The selective GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline methiodide (BMI, 5 or 50 μM, 30 μl), applied at the site of recording greatly enhanced the magnitude and duration of ATP-evoked responses in LE rats, but not in units from HE rats. The convergent cutaneous receptive field (RF) area of TMJ neurons was enlarged after BMI in LE but not HE rats, while resting discharge rates were increased after BMI independent of estrogen status. By contrast, the selective GABAA receptor agonist, muscimol (50 μM, 30 μl), significantly reduced the magnitude and duration of ATP-evoked activity, resting discharge rate, and cutaneous RF area of TMJ neurons in LE and HE rats, whereas lower doses (5 μM) affected only units from LE rats. Protein levels of GABAA receptor β3 isoform at the Vc/C1–2 region were similar for HE and LE rats. These results suggest that GABAergic mechanisms contribute significantly to background discharge rates and TMJ-evoked input to superficial laminae neurons at the Vc/C1–2 region. Estrogen status may gate the magnitude of GABAergic influence on TMJ neurons at the earliest stages of nociceptive processing at the spinomedullary region.

AB  - Abstract
Neuronal loss is the most common and critical feature of a spectrum of brain traumas and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The capacity to generate new neurons in the central nervous system diminishes early during brain development and is restricted mainly to two brain areas in the mature brain: subventricular zone and subgranular zone. Extensive research on the impact of brain injury on endogenous neurogenesis and cognition has been conducted primarily using young animals, when neurogenesis is most active. However, a critical question remains to elucidate the effect of brain injury on endogenous neurogenesis and cognition in older animals, which is far more relevant for age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as AD. Therefore, we examined the impact of neuronal loss on endogenous neurogenesis in aged animals using CaM/Tet-DTA mice, a transgenic model of hippocampal cell loss. Additionally, we investigated whether the upregulation of adult neurogenesis could mitigate cognitive deficits following substantial hippocampal neuronal loss. Our findings demonstrate that aged CaM/Tet-DTA mice that sustain severe neuronal loss exhibit an upregulation of endogenous neurogenesis. However, despite this significant upregulation, neurogenesis alone is not able to mitigate the cognitive deficits observed. Our studies suggest that the aged brain has the capacity to stimulate neurogenesis post-injury; however, multiple therapeutic approaches, including upregulation of endogenous neurogenesis, will be necessary to recover brain function after severe neurodegeneration.

AB  - Abstract
Although the expression of the chemokine receptor CCR1 has been demonstrated in several structures related to nociception, supporting the nociceptive role of chemokines able to activate it, the involvement of CCR1 in neoplastic pain has not been previously assessed. We have assayed the effects of a CCR1 antagonist, J113863, in two murine models of neoplastic hyperalgesia based on the intratibial injection of either NCTC 2472 fibrosarcoma cells, able to induce osteolytic bone injury, or B16-F10 melanoma cells, associated to mixed osteolytic/osteoblastic bone pathological features. The systemic administration of J113863 inhibited thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia but not mechanical allodynia in mice inoculated with NCTC 2472 cells. Moreover, in these mice, thermal hyperalgesia was counteracted following the peritumoral (10–30 μg) but not spinal (3–5 μg) administration of J113863. In contrast, hyperalgesia and allodynia measured in mice inoculated with B16-F10 cells remained unaffected after the administration of J113863.

The inoculation of tumoral cells did not modify the levels of CCL3 at tumor or spinal cord. In contrast, although the concentration of CCL5 remained unmodified in mice inoculated with B16-F10 cells, increased levels of this chemokine were measured in tumor-bearing limbs, but not the spinal cord, of mice inoculated with NCTC 2472 cells. Increased levels of CCL5 were also found following the incubation of NCTC 2472, but not B16-F10, cells in the corresponding culture medium.

The intraplantar injection of CCL5 (0.5 ng) to naïve mice evoked thermal hyperalgesia prevented by the coadministration of J113863 or the CCR5 antagonist, d-Ala-peptide T-amide (DAPTA), demonstrating that CCL5 can induce thermal hyperalgesia in mice through the activation of CCR1 or CCR5. However, contrasting with the inhibitory effect evoked by J113863, the systemic administration of DAPTA did not prevent tumoral hyperalgesia. Finally, the peritumoral administration of an anti-CCL5 antibody completely inhibited thermal hyperalgesia evoked by the inoculation of NCTC 2472 cells.

AB  - Abstract
Immature neurons expressing doublecortin (DCX+) are present around cortical layer II in various mammals including guinea pigs and humans, especially enriched in the paleocortex. However, little is known whether and how functional experience affects the development of this population of neurons. We attempted to explore a modulation by experience to layer II DCX+ cells in the primary olfactory cortex in postnatal and adult guinea pigs. Neonatal and 1-year-old guinea pigs were subjected to unilateral naris-occlusion, followed 1 and 2 months later by morphometry of DCX+ cells in the piriform cortex. DCX+ somata and processes were reduced in the deprived relative to the non-deprived piriform cortex in both age groups at the two surviving time points. The number of DCX+ cells was decreased in the deprived side relative to internal control at 1 and 2 months in the youths and at 2 months in the adults post-occlusion. The mean somal area of DCX+ cells showed a trend of decrease in the deprived side relative to the internal control in the youths. In addition, DCX+ cells in the deprived side exhibited a lower frequency of colocalization with the neuron-specific nuclear antigen (NeuN) relative to counterparts. These results suggest that normal olfactory experience is required for the maintenance and development of DCX+ immature neurons in postnatal and adult guinea pig piriform cortex.

Sensory neurons mediate diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Using a mouse model of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (BKS.Cg-m+/+Leprdb/J (db/db) mice) and cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, the present study showed that hyperglycemia downregulated miR-146a expression and elevated interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinase (IRAK1) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) levels in DRG neurons. In vitro, elevation of miR-146a by miR-146a mimics in DRG neurons increased neuronal survival under high-glucose conditions. Downregulation and elevation of miR-146a in DRG neurons, respectively, were inversely related to IRAK1 and TRAF6 levels. Treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy with sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, augmented miR-146a expression and decreased levels of IRAK1 and TRAF6 in the DRG neurons. In vitro, blockage of miR-146a in DRG neurons abolished the effect of sildenafil on DRG neuron protection and downregulation of IRAK1 and TRAF6 proteins under hyperglycemia. Our data provide the first evidence showing that miR-146a plays an important role in mediating DRG neuron apoptosis under hyperglycemic conditions.

AB  - Abstract
Age-related hearing loss – presbycusis – is the number one communication disorder and most prevalent neurodegenerative condition of our aged population. Although speech understanding in background noise is quite difficult for those with presbycusis, there are currently no biomedical treatments to prevent, delay or reverse this condition. A better understanding of the cochlear mechanisms underlying presbycusis will help lead to future treatments. Objectives of the present study were to investigate GABAA receptor subunit α1, nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptor subunit β2, and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit NR1 mRNA and protein expression changes in spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) of the CBA/CaJ mouse cochlea, that occur in age-related hearing loss, utilizing quantitative immunohistochemistry and semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques. We found that auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds shifted over 40 dB from 3 to 48 kHz in old mice compared to young adults. DPOAE thresholds also shifted over 40 dB from 6 to 49 kHz in old mice, and their amplitudes were significantly decreased or absent in the same frequency range. SGN density decreased with age in basal, middle and apical turns, and SGN density of the basal turn declined the most. A positive correlation was observed between SGN density and ABR wave 1 amplitude. mRNA and protein expression of GABAAR α1 and AChR β2 decreased with age in SGNs in the old mouse cochlea. mRNA and protein expression of NMDAR NR1 increased with age in SGNs of the old mice. These findings demonstrate that there are functionally-relevant age-related changes of GABAAR, nAChR, NMDAR expression in CBA mouse SGNs reflecting their degeneration, which may be related to functional changes in cochlear synaptic transmission with age, suggesting biological mechanisms for peripheral age-related hearing loss.

The 20 amino acid (AA) N-terminus of the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) was examined as a regulator of VMAT2 function. Removal of the first 16 or 19 AAs of the N-terminus resulted in a molecule with reduced ability to sequester [3H]-5HT. A glutathione-S-transferase-construct of the N-terminus underwent phosphorylation in the presence of PKC at serines 15 and 18. These putative phosphorylation sites were examined for effects on function. Phospho-mimetic substitution of serines 15 and 18 with aspartate in the full-length VMAT2 resulted in reduced [3H]-5HT sequestration and reduced methamphetamine (METH)-stimulated efflux of preloaded [3H]-5HT. In contrast, mutation of serines 15 and 18 to alanines maintained intact net substrate sequestration but eliminated METH-stimulated efflux of pre-accumulated [3H]-5HT. In summary, these data suggest a model in which the VMAT2 N-terminus regulates monoamine sequestration.

AB  - Abstract
Serotonin/substance P synthesizing cells in the raphé nuclei of the brain are candidates for designation as central chemoreceptors that are stimulated by CO2/pH. We have previously demonstrated that these neurons are CO2-stimulated in situ. Evidence also suggests that CO2-inhibited raphé neurons recorded in vitro and in situ synthesize GABA. Unknown is whether there are other types of chemosensitive cells in the raphé. Here, we showed that a previously unrecognized pool of raphé neurons also exhibit chemosensitivity, and that they are not serotonergic. We used extracellular recording of individual raphé neurons in the unanesthetized juvenile rat in situ perfused decerebrate brainstem preparation to assess chemosensitivity of raphé neurons. Subsequent juxtacellular labeling of individually recorded cells, and immunohistochemistry for the serotonin synthesizing enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase and for neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R; the receptor for substance P) indicated a group of CO2-stimulated cells that are not serotonergic, but express NK1R and are closely apposed to surrounding serotonergic cells. CO2-stimulated 5-HT and non-5-HT cells constitute distinct groups that have different firing characteristics and hypercapnic sensitivities. Non-5-HT cells fire faster and are more robustly stimulated by CO2 than are 5-HT cells. Thus, we have characterized a previously unrecognized type of CO2-stimulated medullary raphé neuron that is not serotonergic, but may receive input from neighboring serotonin/substance P synthesizing chemosensitive neurons. The potential network properties of the three types of chemosensitive raphé neurons (the present non-5-HT cells, serotonergic cells, and CO2-inhibited cells) remain to be elucidated.

AB  - Abstract
Brain injury due to neonatal hypoxia–ischemia (HI) is more homogenously severe in male than in female mice. Because, necrostatin-1 (nec-1) prevents injury progression only in male mice, we hypothesized that changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling after HI and nec-1 are also sex-specific providing differential conditions to promote recovery of those more severely injured. The increased aromatization of testosterone in male mice during early development and the link between 17-β-estradiol (E2) levels and BDNF transcription substantiate this hypothesis. Hence, we aimed to investigate if sexual differences in BDNF signaling existed in forebrain and diencephalon after HI and HI/nec-1 and their correlation with estrogen receptors (ER). C57B6 mice (p7) received nec-1 (0.1 μl [8 μM]) or vehicle (veh) intracerebroventricularly after HI. At 24 h after HI, BDNF levels increased in both sexes in forebrain without evidence of tropomyosin-receptor-kinase B (TrkB) activation. At 96 h after HI, BDNF levels in forebrain decreased below those seen in control mice of both sexes. Additionally, only in female mice, truncated TrkB (Tc.TrkB) and p75 neurotrophic receptor (p75ntr) levels increased in forebrain and diencephalon. In both, forebrain and diencephalon, nec-1 treatment increased BDNF levels and TrkB activation in male mice while, nec-1 prevented Tc.TrkB and p75ntr increases in female mice. While E2 levels were unchanged by HI or HI/nec-1 in either sex or treatment, ERα:ERβ ratios were increased in diencephalon of nec-1-treated male mice and directly correlated with BDNF levels. Neonatal HI produces sex-specific signaling changes in the BDNF system, that are differentially modulated by nec-1. The regional differences in BDNF levels may be a consequence of injury severity after HI, but sexual differences in response to nec-1 after HI may represent a differential thalamo-cortical preservation or alternatively off-target regional effect of nec-1. The biological significance of ERα predominance and its correlation with BDNF levels is still unclear.

AB  - Abstract
Subliminal electromagnetic fields (EMFs) triggered nonlinear evoked potentials in awake but not anesthetized animals, and increased glucose metabolism in the hindbrain. Field detection occurred somewhere in the head and possibly was an unrecognized function of sensory neurons in facial skin, which synapse in the trigeminal nucleus and project to the thalamus via glutamate-dependent pathways. If so, anesthetic agents that antagonize glutamate neurotransmission would be expected to degrade EMF-evoked potentials (EEPs) to a greater extent than agents having different pharmacological effects. We tested the hypothesis using ketamine which blocks N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs), and xylazine which is an α2-adrenoreceptor agonist. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) of rats were examined using recurrence analysis to observe EEPs in the presence and absence of ketamine and/or xylazine anesthesia. Auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) served as positive controls. The frequency of observation of evoked potentials in a given condition (wake or anesthesia) was compared with that due to chance using the Fisher’s exact test. EEPs were observed in awake rats but not while they were under anesthesia produced using a cocktail of xylazine and ketamine. In another experiment each rat was measured while awake and while under anesthesia produced using either xylazine or ketamine. EEPs and AEPs were detected during wake and under xylazine (P &lt; 0.05 in each of the four measurements). In contrast, neither EEPs nor AEPs were observed when anesthesia was produced partly or wholly using ketamine. The duration and latency of the EEPs was unaltered by xylazine anesthesia. The afferent signal triggered by the transduction of weak EMFs was likely mediated by NMDAR-mediated glutamate neurotransmission.

AB  - Abstract
It was the aim of the present study to investigate menstrual cycle effects on selective attention and its underlying functional cerebral networks. Twenty-one healthy, right-handed, normally cycling women were investigated by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging using a go/no-go paradigm during the menstrual, follicular and luteal phase. On the behavioral level there was a significant interaction between visual half field and cycle phase with reaction times to right-sided compared to left-sided stimuli being faster in the menstrual compared to the follicular phase. These results might argue for a more pronounced functional cerebral asymmetry toward the left hemisphere in selective attention during the menstrual phase with low estradiol and progesterone levels. Functional imaging, however, did not reveal clear-cut menstrual phase-related changes in activation pattern in parallel to these behavioral findings. A functional connectivity analysis identified differences between the menstrual and the luteal phase: During the menstrual phase, left inferior parietal cortex showed a stronger negative correlation with the right middle frontal gyrus while the left medial frontal cortex showed a stronger negative correlation with the left middle frontal gyrus. These results can serve as further evidence of a modulatory effect of steroid hormones on networks of lateralized cognitive functions not only by interhemispheric inhibition but also by affecting intrahemispheric functional connectivity.

AB  - Abstract
Although it is a general consensus that opioids modulate growth, the mechanism of this phenomenon is largely unknown. Since endogenous opiates use the same receptor family as morphine, these peptides may be one of the key regulators of growth in humans by impacting growth hormone (GH) secretion, either directly, or indirectly, via growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) release. However, the exact mechanism of this regulation has not been elucidated yet.

In the present study we identified close juxtapositions between the enkephalinergic/endorphinergic/dynorphinergic axonal varicosities and GHRH-immunoreactive (IR) perikarya in the human hypothalamus. Due to the long post mortem period electron microscopy could not be utilized to detect the presence of synapses between the enkephalinergic/endorphinergic/dynorphinergic and GHRH neurons. Therefore, we used light microscopic double-label immunocytochemistry to identify putative juxtapositions between these systems.

Our findings revealed that the majority of the GHRH-IR perikarya formed intimate associations with enkephalinergic axonal varicosities in the infundibular nucleus/median eminence, while endorphinergic-GHRH juxtapositions were much less frequent. In contrast, no significant dynorphinergic-GHRH associations were detected.

The density of the abutting enkephalinergic fibers on the surface of the GHRH perikarya suggests that these juxtapositions may be functional synapses and may represent the morphological substrate of the impact of enkephalin on growth. The small number of GHRH neurons innervated by the endorphin and dynorphin systems indicates significant differences between the regulatory roles of endogenous opiates on growth in humans.

AB  - Abstract
Neurons in the auditory system are spatially organized in their responses to pure tones, and this tonotopy is expected to predict neuronal responses to more complex sounds such as vocalizations. We presented vocalizations with low-, medium- and high-frequency content to determine if selectivity of neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) of mice respects the tonotopic spatial structure. Tonotopy in the IC predicts that neurons located in dorsal regions should only respond to low-frequency vocalizations and only neurons located in ventral regions should respond to high-frequency vocalizations. We found that responses to vocalizations were independent of location, and many neurons in the dorsal, low-frequency region of IC responded to high-frequency vocalizations. To test whether this was due to dorsal neurons having broad frequency tuning curves, we convolved each neuron’s frequency tuning curve with each vocalization, and found that the tuning curves were not good predictors of the actual neural responses to the vocalizations. We then used a nonlinear model of signal transduction in the cochlea that generates distortion products to predict neural responses to the vocalizations. We found that these predictions more closely matched the actual neural responses. Our findings suggest that the cochlea distorts the frequency representation in vocalizations and some neurons use this distorted representation to encode the vocalizations.

AB  - Abstract
Psychostimulant reward, as assessed via the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm, exhibits a daily rhythm with peaks in the late dark and early light periods, and a nadir near the light-to-dark transition. While this diurnal rhythm is correlated with neural activity in several corticolimbic structures, the brain regions mediating this behavioral rhythm remain unknown. Here, we examine the role of the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The effects of excitotoxic mPFC lesions on daily rhythms in amphetamine CPP were examined at previously observed peak (zeitgeber time [ZT] 23) and nadir times (ZT11). mPFC lesions encompassing the prelimbic and infralimbic subregions increased the CPP for amphetamine at the nadir time, thereby eliminating the daily rhythm in amphetamine reward. To examine the effects of transient mPFC inactivation, rats received intra-mPFC infusions of GABA receptor agonists during the acquisition or expression phases of CPP testing. Inactivation of the ventral mPFC at either of these phases also eliminated the daily rhythm in amphetamine-induced CPP via an increase in drug-paired chamber dwell time at the baseline nadir. Together, these results indicate that the ventral mPFC plays a critical role in mediating the diurnal rhythm in amphetamine CPP during both the acquisition and expression of learned reward–context associations. Moreover, as the loss of rhythmicity occurs via an increase at the nadir point, these results suggest that excitatory output from the ventral mPFC normally inhibits context-elicited reward seeking prior to the light-to-dark transition.

AB  - Abstract
The rat retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) contains neurons that have a well-defined phenotype characterized by the presence of vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) mRNA and a paired-like homeobox 2b (Phox2b)-immunoreactive (ir) nucleus and the absence of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). These neurons are important to chemoreception. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the chemically-coded RTN neurons (ccRTN) (Phox2b+/TH−) are activated during an acute episode of running exercise. Since most RTN neurons are excited by the activation of perifornical and lateral hypothalamus (PeF/LH), a region that regulates breathing during exercise, we also tested the hypothesis that PeF/LH projections to RTN neurons contribute to their activation during acute exercise. In adult male Wistar rats that underwent an acute episode of treadmill exercise, there was a significant increase in c-Fos immunoreactive (c-Fos-ir) in PeF/LH neurons and RTN neurons that were Phox2b+TH− (p &lt; 0.05) compared to rats that did not exercise. Also the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold that was injected into RTN was detected in c-Fos-ir PeF/LH (p &lt; 0.05). In summary, the ccRTN neurons (Phox2b+TH−) are excited by running exercise. Thus, ccRTN neurons may contribute to both the chemical drive to breath and the feed-forward control of breathing associated with exercise.

AB  - Abstract
The aim of present study was to elucidate the role of Interleukin-10 (IL-10) in the neuroprotection of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) against traumatic brain injury (TBI) in mice. The TBI in mice was induced by controlled cortical impact (CCI). HBO was given for 1 h at 2.0 absolute atmosphere (ATA) in 100% O2. HBO enhanced the serumal and cerebral IL-10 protein levels in both sham-operated and TBI mice. HBO therapy after TBI reduced lesion volume, attenuated cerebral edema, improved neurological status including motor and cognitive function, inhibited apoptosis evidenced by decreased ratio of cleaved caspase-3 (C3) to pro-C3 and Bax expression and increased bcl-2 expression, and attenuated inflammation marked by reduced expression of IL-1β, IL-6, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9). In addition, HBO after TBI improved the blood–brain barrier, and upregulated the expression of tight junction proteins including zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and claudin-5. IL-10 deficiency aggravated TBI-induced damage in the brain and abrogated the beneficial effects of HBO on neuroinflammation, apoptosis, and edema after TBI. IL-10 deficiency itself had no significant effect on brain water content and neurological status. In conclusion, IL-10 played an important role in the neuroprotection of HBO therapy against TBI in mice.

AB  - Abstract
Nobiletin, a polymethoxylated flavonoid found in citrus fruit peel, reportedly improves memory impairment in rodent models. Here we report its effect on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced motor and cognitive deficits. Nobiletin administration (50 mg/kg i.p.) for 2 consecutive weeks improved motor deficits seen in MPTP-induced Parkinson model mice by 2 weeks, an effect that continued until 2 weeks after drug withdrawal. Drug treatment promoted similar rescue of MPTP-induced cognitive impairment at equivalent time points. Nonetheless, nobiletin treatment did not block loss of dopaminergic neurons seen in the MPTP-treated mouse midbrain, nor did it rescue decreased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein levels seen in the striatum or hippocampal CA1 region of these mice. Interestingly, nobiletin administration (50 mg/kg i.p.) rescued reduced levels of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) autophosphorylation and phosphorylation at Thr-34 of dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein-32 (DARPP-32) in striatum and hippocampal CA1 to levels seen in sham-operated mice. Likewise, CaMKII- and cAMP kinase-dependent TH phosphorylation was significantly restored by nobiletin treatment. MPTP-induced reduction of dopamine contents in the striatum and hippocampal CA1 region was improved by nobiletin administration (50 mg/kg i.p.). Acute intraperitoneal administration of nobiletin also enhanced dopamine release in striatum and hippocampal CA1, an effect partially inhibited by treatment with nifedipine (a L-type Ca2+ channel inhibitor) or NNC 55-0396 (a T-type Ca2+ channel inhibitor) and completely abolished by combined treatment with both. Overall, our study describes a novel nobiletin activity in brain and suggests that nobiletin rescues motor and cognitive dysfunction in MPTP-induced Parkinson model mice, in part by enhancing dopamine release.

AB  - Abstract
To maintain perception of the world around us during body motion, the brain must update the spatial presentation of visual stimuli, known as space updating. Previous studies have demonstrated that vestibular signals contribute to space updating. Nonetheless, when being passively rotated in the dark, the ability to keep track of a memorized earth-fixed target (EFT) involves learning mechanism(s). We tested whether such learning generalizes across different EFT eccentricities. Furthermore, we ascertained whether learning transfers to similar target eccentricities but in the opposite direction. Participants were trained to predict the position of an EFT (located at 45° to their left) while being rotated counterclockwise (i.e., they press a push button when they perceived that their body midline have cross the position of the target). Overall, the results indicated that learning transferred to other target eccentricity (30° and 60°) for identical body rotation direction. In contrast, vestibular learning partly transferred to target location’s matching body rotation but in the opposite rotation direction. Generalization of learning implies that participants do not adopt cognitive strategies to improve their performance during training. We argue that the brain learned to use vestibular signals for space updating. Generalization of learning while being rotated in the opposite direction implies that some parts of the neural networks involved in space updating is shared between trained and untrained direction.

AB  - Abstract
Studying how the healthy human brain develops is important to understand early pathological mechanisms and to assess the influence of fetal or perinatal events on later life. Brain development relies on complex and intermingled mechanisms especially during gestation and first post-natal months, with intense interactions between genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors. Although the baby’s brain is organized early on, it is not a miniature adult brain: regional brain changes are asynchronous and protracted, i.e. sensory-motor regions develop early and quickly, whereas associative regions develop later and slowly over decades. Concurrently, the infant/child gradually achieves new performances, but how brain maturation relates to changes in behavior is poorly understood, requiring non-invasive in vivo imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Two main processes of early white matter development are reviewed: (1) establishment of connections between brain regions within functional networks, leading to adult-like organization during the last trimester of gestation, (2) maturation (myelination) of these connections during infancy to provide efficient transfers of information. Current knowledge from post-mortem descriptions and in vivo MRI studies is summed up, focusing on T1- and T2-weighted imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and quantitative mapping of T1/T2 relaxation times, myelin water fraction and magnetization transfer ratio.

AB  - Abstract
The homeobox-containing transcription factor Otx2 controls the identity, fate and proliferation of mesencephalic dopaminergic (mesDA) neurons. Transgenic mice, in which Otx2 was conditionally overexpressed by a Cre recombinase expressed under the transcriptional control of the Engrailed1 gene (En1Cre/+; tOtx2ov/+), show an increased number of mesDA neurons during development. In adult mice, Otx2 is expressed in a subset of neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and its overexpression renders mesDA more resistant to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-HCl (MPTP) neurotoxin. Here we further investigated the neurological consequences of the increased number of mesDA neurons in En1Cre/+; tOtx2ov/+ adult mice. Immunohistochemistry for the active, glycosylated form of the dopamine transporter (glyco-Dat) showed that En1Cre/+; tOtx2ov/+ adult mice display an increased density of mesocortical DAergic fibers, as compared to control animals. Increased glyco-Dat staining was accompanied by a marked hypolocomotion in En1Cre/+; tOtx2ov/+ mice, as detected in the open field test. Since conditional knockout mice lacking Otx2 in mesDA precursors (En1Cre/+; Otx2floxv/flox mice) show a marked resistance to kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures, we investigated the behavioral response to KA in En1Cre/+; tOtx2ov/+ and control mice. No difference was observed between mutant and control mice, but En1Cre/+; tOtx2ov/+ mice showed a markedly different c-fos mRNA induction profile in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus after KA seizures, as compared to controls. Accordingly, an increased density of parvalbumin (PV)-positive inhibitory interneurons was detected in the deep layers of the frontal cortex of naïve En1Cre/+; tOtx2ov/+ mice, as compared to controls. These data indicate that Otx2 overexpression results in increased DAergic innervation and PV cell density in the fronto-parietal cortex, with important consequences on spontaneous locomotor activity and seizure-induced gene expression. Our results strengthen the notion that Otx2 mutant mouse models are a powerful genetic tool to unravel the molecular and behavioral consequences of altered development of the DAergic system.

AB  - Abstract
Mas-related G-protein-coupled receptor subtype C (MrgC) may play an important role in pain sensation. However, the distribution of MrgC receptors in different subpopulations of rodent dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons has not been clearly demonstrated owing to a lack of MrgC-selective antibody. It is also unclear whether peripheral nerve injury induces different time-dependent changes in MrgC expression in injured and uninjured DRG neurons. Here we showed that MrgC immunoreactivity is distributed in both IB4-positive (non-peptidergic) and calcitonin gene-related peptide-positive (peptidergic) DRG neurons in mice and rats. Importantly, the MrgC mRNA level and MrgC immunoreactivity were both decreased in the injured L5 DRG compared to corresponding levels in the contralateral (uninjured) DRG in rats on days 14 and 30 after an L5 spinal nerve ligation. In contrast, mRNA and protein levels of MrgC were increased in the adjacent uninjured L4 DRG. Thus, nerve injury may induce temporal changes in MrgC expression that differ between injured and uninjured DRG neurons. In animal behavior tests, chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve induced mechanical pain hypersensitivity in wild-type mice and Mrg-clusterΔ−/− mice (Mrg KO). However, the duration of mechanical hypersensitivity was longer in the Mrg KO mice than in their wild-type littermates, indicating that activation of Mrgs may constitute an endogenous mechanism that inhibits the maintenance of neuropathic pain in mice. These findings extend our knowledge about the distribution of MrgC in rodent DRG neurons and the regulation of its expression by nerve injury.

AB  - Abstract
Disruption in nerve growth factor (NGF) signaling via tropomyosin-related kinase A (trkA) receptors compromises the integrity of the basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic system, yielding cognitive, specifically attentional, impairments in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although normal aging is considered a risk factor for AD, the mechanisms underlying the selective vulnerability of the aging cholinergic system to trkA disruption is not clear. The levels of proNGF, a proneurotrophin that possesses higher affinity for p75 receptors, increase in aging. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that cholinergic and attentional dysfunction in aged rats with reduced BF trkA receptors occurs due to the overactivation of endogenous proNGF signaling. We employed a viral vector that produced trkA shRNA to suppress trkA receptors in the corticopetal cholinergic neurons of aged rats. BF trkA suppression impaired animals’ performance on signal trials in both the sustained attention task (SAT) and the cognitively taxing distractor version of SAT (dSAT) and these deficits were normalized by chronic intracerebroventricular administration of proNGF antibody. Moreover, depolarization-evoked acetylcholine (ACh) release and the density of cortical cholinergic fibers were partially restored in these animals. However, SAT/dSAT scores reflecting overall performance did not improve following proNGF blockade in trkA knockdown rats due to impaired performance in non-signal trials. Sustained proNGF blockade alone did not alter baseline attentional performance but produced moderate impairments during challenging conditions. Collectively, our findings indicate that barring proNGF-p75 signaling may exert some beneficial effects on attentional capacities specifically when BF trkA signaling is abrogated. However, endogenous proNGF may also possess neurotrophic effects and blockade of this proneurotrophin may not completely ameliorate attentional impairments in AD and potentially hinder performance during periods of high cognitive load in normal aging.

AB  - Abstract
Alterations in cerebrovascular structure and function may underlie the most common age-associated cognitive, psychiatric, and neurological conditions presented by older adults. Although much remains to understand, existing research suggests several age-associated detrimental conditions may be mediated through sometimes subtle small vessel-induced damage to the cerebral white matter. Here we review a selected portion of the vast work that demonstrates links between changes in vascular and neural health as a function of advancing age, and how even changes in low-to-moderate risk individuals, potentially beginning early in the adult age-span, may have an important impact on functional status in late life.

AB  - Abstract
Recent neuroscientific studies have identified activity changes in an extensive cerebral network consisting of medial prefrontal cortex, precuneus, temporo–parietal junction, and temporal pole during the perception and identification of self- and other-generated stimuli. Because this network is supposed to be engaged in tasks which require agent identification, it has been labeled the evaluation network (e-network). The present study used self- versus other-generated movement sounds (long jumps) and electroencephalography (EEG) in order to unravel the neural dynamics of agent identification for complex auditory information. Participants (N = 14) performed an auditory self–other identification task with EEG. Data was then subjected to a subsequent standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) analysis (source localization analysis). Differences between conditions were assessed using t-statistics (corrected for multiple testing) on the normalized and log-transformed current density values of the sLORETA images. Three-dimensional sLORETA source localization analysis revealed cortical activations in brain regions mostly associated with the e-network, especially in the medial prefrontal cortex (bilaterally in the alpha-1-band and right-lateralized in the gamma-band) and the temporo–parietal junction (right hemisphere in the alpha-1-band). Taken together, the findings are partly consistent with previous functional neuroimaging studies investigating unimodal visual or multimodal agent identification tasks (cf. e-network) and extent them to the auditory domain. Cortical activations in brain regions of the e-network seem to have functional relevance, especially the significantly higher cortical activation in the right medial prefrontal cortex.

AB  - Abstract
The transient exposure of immature rodents to ethanol during postnatal day 7 (P7), comparable to a time point within the third trimester of human pregnancy, induces neurodegeneration. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the deleterious effects of ethanol on the developing brain are poorly understood. In our previous study, we showed that a high dose administration of ethanol at P7 enhances G9a and leads to caspase-3-mediated degradation of dimethylated H3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me2). In this study, we investigated the potential role of epigenetic changes at G9a exon1, G9a-mediated H3 dimethylation on neurodegeneration and G9a-associated proteins in the P7 brain following exposure to a low dose of ethanol. We found that a low dose of ethanol induces mild neurodegeneration in P7 mice, enhances specific acetylation of H3 on lysine 14 (H3K14ace) at G9a exon1, G9a protein levels, augments the dimethylation of H3K9 and H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me2). However, neither dimethylated H3K9 nor K27 underwent degradation. Pharmacological inhibition of G9a activity prior to ethanol treatment prevented H3 dimethylation and neurodegeneration. Further, our immunoprecipitation data suggest that G9a directly associates with DNA methyltransferase (DNMT3A) and methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). In addition, DNMT3A and MeCP2 protein levels were enhanced by a low dose of ethanol that was shown to induce mild neurodegeneration. Collectively, these epigenetic alterations lead to association of G9a, DNMT3A and MeCP2 to form a larger repressive complex and have a significant role in low-dose ethanol-induced neurodegeneration in the developing brain.

AB  - Abstract
Although the clearance of glutamate from the synapse under physiological conditions is performed by astrocytic glutamate transporters, their expression might be diminished under pathological conditions. Microglia glutamate transporters, however, might serve as a back-up system when astrocytic glutamate uptake is impaired, and could have a prominent neuroprotective function under pathological conditions. In the current study, the effect of nicotine, well known as a neuroprotective molecule, on the function of glutamate transporters in cultured rat cortical microglia was examined. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and pharmacological approaches demonstrated that, glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST), not glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1), is the major functional glutamate transporter in cultured cortical microglia. Furthermore, the α7 subunit was demonstrated to be the key subunit comprising nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptors in these cells. Treatment of cortical microglia with nicotine led to a significant increase of GLAST mRNA expression and 14C-glutamate uptake in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, which were markedly inhibited by pretreatment with methyllycaconitine, a selective α7 nACh receptor antagonist. The nicotine-induced expression of GLAST mRNA and protein is mediated through an inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) depend intracellular pathway, since pretreatment with either xestospongin C, an IP3 receptor antagonist, or KN-93, a CaMKII inhibitor, blocked GLAST expression. Together, these findings indicate that activation of nACh receptors, specifically those expressing the α7 subunit, on cortical microglia could be a key mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of nACh receptor ligands such as nicotine.

AB  - Abstract
Stress affects brain activity and promotes long-term changes in multiple neural systems. Exposure to stressors causes substantial effects on the perception and response to pain. In several animal models, chronic stress produces lasting hyperalgesia. The insular (IC) and anterior cingulate cortices (ACC) are the regions exhibiting most reliable pain-related activity. And the IC and ACC play an important role in pain modulation via the descending pain modulatory system. In the present study we examined the expression of phospho-cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB) and c-Fos in the IC and ACC after forced swim stress (FS) and complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) injection to clarify changes in the cerebral cortices that affect the activity of the descending pain modulatory system in the rats with stress-induced hyperalgesia. FS (day 1, 10 min; days 2–3, 20 min) induced an increase in the expression of pCREB and c-Fos in the anterior IC (AIC). CFA injection into the hindpaw after the FS shows significantly enhanced thermal hyperalgesia and induced a decrease in the expression of c-Fos in the AIC and the posterior IC (PIC). Quantitative image analysis showed that the numbers of c-Fos-immunoreactive neurons in the left AIC and PIC were significantly lower in the FS + CFA group (L AIC, 95.9 ± 6.8; L PIC, 181.9 ± 23.1) than those in the naive group (L AIC, 151.1 ± 19.3, p &lt; 0.05; L PIC, 274.2 ± 37.3, p &lt; 0.05). These findings suggest a neuroplastic change in the IC after FS, which may be involved in the enhancement of CFA-induced thermal hyperalgesia through dysfunction of the descending pain modulatory system.

AB  - Abstract
Adenosine is a wide-spread endogenous neuromodulator. In the central nervous system it activates A1 and A2A receptors (A1Rs and A2ARs) which have differential distributions, different affinities to adenosine, are coupled to different G-proteins, and have opposite effects on synaptic transmission. Although effects of adenosine are studied in detail in several brain areas, such as the hippocampus and striatum, the heterogeneity of the effects of A1R and A2AR activation and their differential distribution preclude generalization over brain areas and cell types. Here we study adenosine’s effects on excitatory synaptic transmission to layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in slices of the rat visual cortex. We measured effects of bath application of adenosine receptor ligands on evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), miniature excitatory postsynaptic potentials (mEPSPs), and membrane properties. Adenosine reduced the amplitude of evoked EPSPs and excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), and reduced frequency of mEPSPs in a concentration-dependent and reversible manner. Concurrent with EPSP/C amplitude reduction was an increase in the paired-pulse ratio. These effects were blocked by application of the selective A1R antagonist DPCPX (8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine), suggesting that activation of presynaptic A1Rs suppresses excitatory transmission by reducing release probability. Adenosine (20 μM) hyperpolarized the cell membrane from −65.3 ± 1.5 to −67.7 ± 1.8 mV, and reduced input resistance from 396.5 ± 44.4 to 314.0 ± 36.3 MOhm (∼20%). These effects were also abolished by DPCPX, suggesting postsynaptic A1Rs. Application of the selective A2AR antagonist SCH-58261 (2-(2-furanyl)-7-(2-phenylethyl)-7H-pyrazolo[4,3-e][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidin-5-a-mine) on the background of high adenosine concentrations revealed an additional decrease in EPSP amplitude. Moreover, application of the A2AR agonist CGS-21680 (4-[2-[[6-amino-9-(N-ethyl-β-d-ribofuranuronamidosyl)-9H-purin-2-yl]amino]ethyl]benzenepropanoic acid hydrochloride) led to an A1R-dependent increase in mEPSP frequency. Dependence of the A2AR effects on the A1R availability suggests interaction between these receptors, whereby A2ARs exert their facilitatory effect on synaptic transmission by inhibiting the A1R-mediated suppression.

Our results demonstrate functional pre and postsynaptic A1Rs and presynaptic A2ARs in layer 2/3 of the visual cortex, and suggest interaction between presynaptic A2ARs and A1Rs.

AB  - Abstract
Inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility are two key executive functions that develop in childhood and adolescence, increasing one’s capacity to respond dynamically to changing external demands and refrain from impulsive behaviors. These gains evolve in concert with significant brain development. Magnetic resonance imaging studies have identified numerous frontal and cingulate cortical areas associated with performance on inhibition tasks, but less is known about the involvement of the underlying anatomical connectivity, namely white matter. Here we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to examine correlations between a DTI-derived parameter, fractional anisotropy (FA) of white matter, and performance on the NEPSY-II Inhibition test (Naming, Inhibition and Switching conditions) in 49 healthy children aged 5–16 years (20 females; 29 males). First, whole brain voxel-based analysis revealed several clusters in the frontal projections of the corpus callosum, where higher FA was associated with worse inhibitory performance, as well as several clusters in posterior brain regions and one in the brainstem where higher FA was associated with better cognitive flexibility (in the Switching task), suggesting a dichotomous relationship between FA and these two aspects of cognitive control. Tractography through these clusters identified several white matter tracts, which were then manual traced in native space. Pearson’s correlations confirmed associations between higher FA of frontal projections of the corpus callosum with poorer inhibitory performance (independent of age), though associations with Switching were not significant. Post-hoc evaluation suggested that FA of orbital and anterior frontal projections of the corpus callosum also mediated performance differences across conditions, which may reflect differences in self-monitoring or strategy use. These findings suggest a link between the development of inhibition and cognitive control with that of the underlying white matter, and may help to identify deviations of neurobiology in adolescent psychopathology.

AB  - Abstract
The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the mammalian hypothalamus contains a circadian clock for timing of diverse neuronal, endocrine, and behavioral rhythms, such as the cycle of sleep and wakefulness. Using extracellular single unit recordings, we have determined, for the first time, the discharge activity of individual SCN neurons during the complete wake–sleep cycle in non-anesthetized, head restrained mice. SCN neurons (n = 79) were divided into three types according to their regular (type I; n = 38) or irregular (type II; n = 19) discharge activity throughout the wake–sleep cycle or their quiescent activity during waking and irregular discharge activity during sleep (type III; n = 22). The type I and II neurons displayed a long-duration action potential, while the type III neurons displayed either a short-duration or long-duration action potential. The type I neurons discharged exclusively as single isolated spikes, whereas the type II and III neurons fired as single isolated spikes, clusters, or bursts. The type I and II neurons showed wake-active, wake/paradoxical (or rapid eye movement) sleep-active, or state-unrelated activity profiles and were, respectively, mainly located in the ventral or dorsal region of the SCN. In contrast, the type III neurons displayed sleep-active discharge profiles and were mainly located in the lateral region of the SCN. The majority of type I and II neurons tested showed an increase in discharge rate following application of light to the animal’s eyes. Of the 289 extra-SCN neurons recorded, those displaying sleep-active discharge profiles were mainly located dorsal to the SCN, whereas those displaying wake-active discharge profiles were mainly located lateral or dorsolateral to the SCN. This study shows heterogeneity of mouse SCN and surrounding anterior hypothalamic neurons and suggests differences in their topographic organization and roles in mammalian circadian rhythms and the regulation of sleep and wakefulness.

AB  - Abstract
The amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide play central roles in the pathology and etiology of Alzheimer’s disease. Amyloid-induced impairments in neurogenesis have been investigated in several transgenic mouse models but the mechanism of action remains to be conclusively demonstrated. The changes in neurogenesis during this transition of increasing Aβ levels and plaque formation were investigated in the present study. We found that the proliferation of newborn cell in the dentate gyrus was enhanced prior to elevations in soluble Aβ production as well as amyloid deposition in 5-week-old TgCRND8 mice, which are well-established Alzheimer’s disease models, compared to non-transgenic (Non-Tg) mice. The number of BrdU-positive cells remained higher in TgCRND8 vs Non-Tg mice for a period of 8 weeks. The numbers of BrdU/NeuN-positive cells were not significantly different in TgCRND8 compared to Non-Tg mice. A significant decrease in BrdU/GFAP but not in BrdU/S100β was found in Tg vs Non-Tg at 6-weeks of age. In addition, a unique observation was made using isolated neuroprogenitor cells from TgCRND8 mice which were found to be less viable in culture and produced substantial amounts of secreted Aβ peptides. This suggests that the proliferation of neural progenitors in vivo may be modulated by high levels of APP expression and the resulting Aβ generated directly by the progenitor cells. These findings indicate that cell proliferation is increased prior to Aβ deposition and that cell viability is decreased in TgCRND8 mice over time.

AB  - Abstract
Inflammation-induced chemoattraction plays a major role in adult subventricular zone (SVZ)-derived precursor cell migration following neural cell loss, in particular through the release of chemokines by activated microglia and macrophages. We previously demonstrated that monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) (chemokine (c-c motif) ligand (CCL)2), macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α) (CCL3) and growth regulatory protein-α (GRO-α) (chemokine (c-x-c motif) ligand (CXCL)1) are up-regulated following neural cell loss in the adult striatum and act as potent chemoattractants for SVZ-derived precursor cells in vitro. Based on these observations, the current study aimed to examine the individual effect of MCP-1, MIP-1α and GRO-α on the migration of adult SVZ-derived neural precursor cells in vivo. To address this without the confounding effects of injury-induced chemotactic cues, adeno-associated viral (AAV)2-mediated in vivo gene transfer was used to ectopically express either MCP-1, MIP-1α or GRO-α, or the control red fluorescent protein (RFP) in the normal adult rat striatum. The extent of doublecortin (Dcx)-positive cell recruitment from the SVZ into the striatal parenchyma was then determined at 4 and 8 weeks following AAV2 injection. Ectopic expression either of MCP-1 or MIP-1α in the normal adult rat brain significantly increased the number of Dcx-positive cells and the extent of their migration into the striatum at both 4 and 8 weeks after vector injection but did not promote either precursor cell proliferation or neural differentiation. In contrast, while over-expression of GRO-α 4 weeks after vector injection induced a significant increase in Dcx-positive cell migration compared to control, this effect was reduced to control levels by 8 weeks post injection. Further, direct comparison between MCP-1, MIP-1α and GRO-α at both 4 and 8 weeks post vector injection indicated that GRO-α may have a reduced effect in inducing Dcx-positive cell migration when compared to MCP-1. Combined, these results confirm that over-expression of the chemokines MCP-1, MIP-1α and GRO-α can override cues directing precursor cell migration along the rostral migratory stream (RMS) and provides a mechanism by which neural precursor cell migration can be redirected into a non-neurogenic region. Differences in the migratory effect observed between individual chemokine may be due to ligand-binding affinity and/or receptor expression on SVZ-derived precursor cells.

AB  - Abstract
Our laboratory has previously described the characteristics of neuronal injury in a rat compression model of spinal cord injury (SCI), focussing on the impact of this injury on the gray matter. However, white matter damage is known to play a critical role in functional outcome following injury. Therefore, in the present study, we used immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy to examine the alterations to the white matter that are initiated by compression SCI applied at T12 vertebral level. A significant loss of axonal and dendritic cytoskeletal proteins was observed at the injury epicenter within 1 day of injury. This was accompanied by axonal dysfunction, as demonstrated by the accumulation of β-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP), with a peak at 3 days post-SCI. A similar, acute loss of cytoskeletal proteins was observed up to 5 mm away from the injury epicenter and was particularly evident rostral to the lesion site, whereas β-APP accumulation was prominent in tracts proximal to the injury. Early myelin loss was confirmed by myelin basic protein (MBP) immunostaining and by electron microscopy, which also highlighted the infiltration of inflammatory and red blood cells. However, 6 weeks after injury, areas of new Schwann cell and oligodendrocyte myelination were observed. This study demonstrates that substantial white matter damage occurs following compression SCI in the rat. Moreover, the loss of cytoskeletal proteins and accumulation of β-APP up to 5 mm away from the lesion site within 1 day of injury indicates the rapid manner in which the axonal damage extends in the rostro-caudal axis. This is likely due to both Wallerian degeneration and spread of secondary cell death, with the latter affecting axons both proximal and distal to the injury.

AB  - Abstract
Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor involved in the orchestration of antioxidant responses. Although its pharmacological activation has been largely hypothesized as a promising tool to ameliorate the progression of neurodegenerative events, the actual knowledge about its modulation in neurotoxic paradigms remains scarce. In this study, we investigated the early profile of Nrf2 modulation in striatal slices of rodents incubated in the presence of the toxic kynurenine pathway metabolite, quinolinic acid (QUIN). Tissue slices from rats and mice were obtained and used throughout the experiments in order to compare inter-species responses. Nuclear Nrf2 protein levels and oxidative damage to lipids were compared. Time– and concentration–response curves of all markers were explored. Nrf2 nuclear activation was corroborated through phase 2 antioxidant protein expression. The effects of QUIN on Nrf2 modulation and oxidative stress were also compared between slices of wild-type (Nrf2+/+) and Nrf2 knock-out (Nrf2−/−) mice. The possible involvement of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) in the Nrf2 modulation and lipid peroxidation was further explored in mice striatal slices. In rat striatal slices, QUIN stimulated the Nrf2 nuclear translocation. This effect was accompanied by augmented lipid peroxidation. In the mouse striatum, QUIN per se exerted an induction of Nrf2 factor only at 1 h of incubation, and a concentration–response effect on lipid peroxidation after 3 h of incubation. QUIN stimulated the striatal content of phase 2 enzymes. Nrf2−/− mice were slightly more responsive than Nrf2+/+ mice to the QUIN-induced oxidative damage, and completely unresponsive to the NMDAr antagonist MK-801 when tested against QUIN. Findings of this study indicate that: (1) Nrf2 is modulated in rodent striatal tissue in response to QUIN; (2) Nrf2−/− striatal tissue was moderately more vulnerable to oxidative damage than the Wt condition; and (3) early Nrf2 up-regulation reflects a compensatory response to the QUIN-induced oxidative stress in course as part of a general defense system, whereas Nrf2 down-regulation might contribute to more intense oxidative cell damage.

AB  - Abstract
Hippocampus is one of the brain regions in which neuroplastic changes occur. Paradigms such as environmental enrichment (ENR) have been used to prevent or delay the neuroplastic changes of the hippocampus during aging. Here, we investigated the beneficial effects of ENR on dendritic spines and hippocampal neurogenesis in middle age BalbC mice. ENR increased the number of dendritic spines, cell survival, and intermediate stages of the hippocampal neurodevelopment process. Also, ENR alters the distribution of cells involved in the neurogenic process along the dorsal–ventral dentate gyrus. In addition, ENR increased the proportion of cells with more mature dendritic morphology and net hippocampal neurogenesis. Whole-hippocampus protein extracts revealed that ENR increases the levels of BDNF, phospho-Akt and phospho-MAPK1/2, suggesting that the positive effects of ENR on neuroplasticity in middle age BalbC mice involve the participation of these key-signaling proteins. Our results suggest that ENR is a relevant strategy to prevent neuroplastic decline by increasing the formation of both dendritic spines and new neurons in the hippocampus during middle age.

AB  - Abstract
Recent research has investigated the expression and secretion of neuropeptides by tumors, and the potential of these peptides to facilitate tumor growth and spread. In particular, substance P (SP) and its receptor NK1 have been implicated in tumor cell growth and evasion of apoptosis, although few studies have examined this relationship in vivo. The present study used both in vitro and in vivo models to characterize the role of SP in tumor pathogenesis. Immunohistochemical assessment of human primary and secondary brain tumor tissue demonstrated a marked increase in SP and its NK1 receptor in all tumor types investigated. Of the metastatic tumors, melanoma demonstrated particularly elevated SP and NK1 receptor staining. Subsequently, A-375 human melanoma cell line was examined in vitro and found to express both SP and the NK1 receptor. Treatment with the NK1 receptor antagonist Emend IV resulted in decreased cell viability and an increase in cell death in this cell line in vitro. An animal model of brain tumors using the same cell line was employed to assess the effect of Emend IV on tumor growth in vivo. Administration of Emend IV was found to decrease tumor volume and decrease cellular proliferation indicating that SP may play a role in tumor pathogenesis within the brain. We conclude that SP may provide a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of certain types of brain tumors, with further research required to determine whether the role of SP in cancer is tumor-type dependent.

AB  - Abstract
Melatonin is a neurohormone associated with circadian rhythms. A diurnal rhythm in olfactory sensitivity has been previously reported and melatonin receptor mRNAs have been observed in the olfactory bulb, but the effects of melatonin in the olfactory bulb have not been explored. First, we corroborated data from a previous study that identified melatonin receptor messenger RNAs in the olfactory bulb. We then investigated whether melatonin treatment would affect cells in the olfactory bulbs of rats. Using a combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), quantitative PCR (qPCR), cell culture, and electrophysiology, we discovered that melatonin receptors and melatonin synthesis enzymes were present in the olfactory bulb and we observed changes in connexin43 protein, GluR1 mRNA, GluR2 mRNA, Per1 mRNA, Cry2 mRNA, and K+ currents in response to 2-iodomelatonin. Via qPCR, we observed that messenger RNAs encoding melatonin receptors and melatonin biosynthesis enzymes fluctuated in the olfactory bulb across 24 h. Together, these data show that melatonin receptors are present in the olfactory bulb and likely affect olfactory function. Additionally, these data suggest that melatonin may be locally synthesized in the olfactory bulb.

AB  - Abstract
Surgery induces learning and memory impairment. Neuroinflammation may contribute to this impairment. Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is an important transcription factor to regulate the expression of inflammatory cytokines. We hypothesize that inhibition of NF-κB by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) reduces neuroinflammation and the impairment of learning and memory. To test this hypothesis, four-month-old male Fischer 344 rats were subjected to right carotid exploration under propofol and buprenorphine anesthesia. Some rats received two doses of 50 mg/kg PDTC given intraperitoneally 30 min before and 6 h after the surgery. Rats were tested in the Barnes maze and fear conditioning paradigm begun 6 days after the surgery. Expression of various proteins related to inflammation was examined in the hippocampus at 24 h or 21 days after the surgery. Here, surgery, but not anesthesia alone, had a significant effect on prolonging the time needed to identify the target hole during the training sessions of the Barnes maze. Surgery also increased the time for identifying the target hole in the long-term memory test and decreased context-related learning and memory in fear conditioning test. Also, surgery increased nuclear expression of p65, a NF-κB component, decreased cytoplasmic amount of inhibitor of NF-κB, and increased the expression of interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 and active matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9). Finally, surgery enhanced IgG extravasation in the hippocampus. These surgical effects were attenuated by PDTC. These results suggest that surgery, but not propofol-based anesthesia, induces neuroinflammation and impairment of learning and memory. PDTC attenuates these effects possibly by inhibiting NF-κB activation and the downstream MMP-9 activity.

AB  - Abstract
Bilateral injections of the GABAA agonist muscimol into the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) induce 0.3 M NaCl and water intake in satiated and normovolemic rats, a response reduced by intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of losartan or atropine (angiotensinergic type 1 (AT1) and cholinergic muscarinic receptor antagonists, respectively). In the present study, we investigated the effects of the injections of losartan or atropine into the subfornical organ (SFO) on 0.3 M NaCl and water intake induced by injections of muscimol into the LPBN. In addition, using intracellular calcium measurement, we also tested the sensitivity of SFO-cultured cells to angiotensin II (ANG II) and carbachol (cholinergic agonist). In male Holtzman rats with cannulas implanted bilaterally into the LPBN and into the SFO, injections of losartan (1 μg/0.1 μl) or atropine (2 nmol/0.1 μl) into the SFO almost abolished 0.3 M NaCl and water intake induced by muscimol (0.5 nmol/0.2 μl) injected into the LPBN. In about 30% of the cultured cells of the SFO, carbachol and ANG II increased intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). Three distinct cell populations were found in the SFO, i.e., cells activated by either ANG II (25%) or carbachol (2.6%) or by both stimuli (2.3%). The results suggest that the activation of angiotensinergic and cholinergic mechanisms in the SFO is important for NaCl and water intake induced by the deactivation of LPBN inhibitory mechanisms with muscimol injections. They also show that there are cells in the SFO activated by both angiotensinergic and cholinergic stimuli, perhaps those involved in the responses to muscimol into the LPBN.

AB  - Abstract
Acute and chronic pain resulting from injury, surgery, or disease afflicts &gt;100 million Americans each year, having a severe impact on mood, mental health, and quality of life. The lack of structural and functional information for most ion channels, many of which play key roles in the detection and transmission of noxious stimuli, means that there remain unidentified therapeutic targets for pain management. This study focuses on the transient receptor potential canonical subfamily 4 (TRPC4) ion channel, which is involved in the tissue-specific and stimulus-dependent regulation of intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Rats with a transposon-mediated TRPC4-knockout mutation displayed tolerance to visceral pain induced by colonic mustard oil (MO) exposure, but not somatic or neuropathic pain stimuli. Moreover, wild-type rats treated with a selective TRPC4 antagonist (ML-204) prior to MO exposure mimicked the behavioral responses observed in TRPC4-knockout rats. Significantly, ML-204 inhibited visceral pain-related behavior in a dose-dependent manner without noticeable adverse effects. These data provide evidence that TRPC4 is required for detection and/or transmission of colonic MO visceral pain sensation. In the future, inhibitors of TRPC4 signaling may provide a highly promising path for the development of first-in-class therapeutics for this visceral pain, which may have fewer side effects and less addictive potential than opioid derivatives.

This study was conducted to examine the behavioral consequences of unlimited consumption of highly palatable food (HPF) and investigate its underlying neural mechanisms. Male Sprague–Dawley rats had free access to chocolate cookie rich in fat (HPF) in addition to ad libitum chow and the control group received chow only. Rats were subjected to behavioral tests during the 2nd week of food condition; i.e. ambulatory activity test on the 8th, elevated plus maze test (EPM) on the 10th and forced swim test (FST) on the 14th day of food condition. After 8 days of food condition, another group of rats were placed in a restraint box and tail bloods were collected at 0, 20, 60, and 120 time points during 2 h of restraint period, used for the plasma corticosterone assay. At the end of restraint session, rats were sacrificed and the tissue sections of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) were processed for c-Fos immunohistochemistry. Ambulatory activities and the scores of EPM were not significantly affected by unlimited cookie consumption. However, immobility duration during FST was increased, and swim decreased, in the rats received free cookie access compared with control rats. Stress-induced corticosterone increase was exaggerated in cookie-fed rats, while the stress-induced c-Fos expression in the NAc was blunted, compared to control rats. Results suggest that free access to HPF may lead to the development of depression-like behaviors in rats, likely in relation with dysfunctions in the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and the reward center.

AB  - Abstract
Both neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and its receptor ErbB4 are susceptibility genes for schizophrenia. Reduced synchronization of evoked oscillations in several cortical regions, especially in the prefrontal cortex, is associated with the core symptoms of schizophrenia. Recent studies have reported that NRG1 may affect the hippocampal oscillations. However, the role of NRG1/ErbB4 signaling in the synchronization of neurons in the prefrontal cortex is unclear. Here, we found that NRG1 enhanced the synchrony of pyramidal neurons via presynaptic interneurons. Meanwhile, NRG1 also increased the synchrony between pairs of fast-spiking interneurons and pairs of fast-spiking and non-fast-spiking interneurons in the prefrontal cortex, and this effect was mediated by ErbB4 receptors. Moreover, the NRG1-enhanced synchrony of interneurons was through their mutually-inhibitory synapses but not electrical coupling. Furthermore, kainate-induced gamma oscillations in vivo were enhanced by NRG1 and did not change in Dlx5/6-ErbB4−/− mice in which the ErbB4 receptors were specifically knocked out in interneurons of the frontal brain. Overall, our findings suggested that NRG1/ErbB4 signaling plays an important role in the synchronized oscillations of the whole network in the prefrontal cortex that are impaired in schizophrenia.

AB  - Abstract
Spontaneous depolarizations around the core are a consistent feature of focal cerebral ischemia, but the associated regional hemodynamic changes are heterogeneous. We determined how the features of depolarizations relate to subsequent cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes in global forebrain ischemia.

Forebrain ischemia was produced in halothane-anesthetized rats (n = 13) by common carotid artery occlusion and hypovolemic hypotension. Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was monitored via a femoral catheter. Specific illuminations allowed the capture of image sequences through a cranial window to visualize: changes in membrane potential (voltage-sensitive dye method); CBF (laser speckle contrast imaging); cerebral blood volume (intrinsic optical signal, IOS at 540–550 nm); and hemoglobin deoxygenation (IOS at 620–640 nm).

A depolarization occurred (n = 9) when CBF fell below 43.4 ± 5% of control (41 ± 4 mmHg MABP), and propagated with a distinct wave front at a rate of 2.8 mm/min. Depolarizations were either persistent (n = 4), intermediate (n = 3) or short, transient depolarization (n = 2). Persistent and intermediate depolarizations were associated with sustained hypoperfusion (−11.7 ± 5.1%) and transient hypoperfusion (−17.4 ± 5.2, relative to CBF before depolarization). Short, transient depolarizations did not generate clear CBF responses.

Depolarizations during incomplete global ischemia occurred at the lower limit of CBF autoregulation, propagated similar to spreading depolarization (SD), and the hemodynamic responses indicated inverse neurovascular coupling. Similar to SDs associated with focal stroke, the propagating event can be persistent or transient.

AB  - Abstract
About half of the human brain is white matter, characterized by axons covered in myelin, which facilitates the high speed of nerve signals from one brain area to another. At the time of myelination, the oligodendrocytes that synthesize myelin require a large amount of energy for this task. Conditions that deprive the tissue of energy can kill the oligodendrocytes. During brain development, the oligodendrocytes may use lactate as an alternative source of energy and material for myelin formation. Mature oligodendrocytes, however, can release lactate through the myelin sheath as nutrient for axons. In addition, lactate carries signals as a volume transmitter. Myelin thus seems to serve as a provider of substrates and signals for axons, and not as a mere insulator. We review the fluxes of lactate in white matter and their significance in brain function.

AB  - Abstract
Associative learning is encoded under anesthesia and involves the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Neuronal activity in mPFC increases in response to a conditioned stimulus (CS+) previously paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US) but not during presentation of an unpaired stimulus (CS−) in anesthetized animals. Studies in conscious animals have shown dissociable roles for different mPFC subregions in mediating various memory processes, with the prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) cortex involved in the retrieval and extinction of conditioned responding, respectively. Therefore PL and IL may also play different roles in mediating the retrieval and extinction of discrimination learning under anesthesia. Here we used in vivo electrophysiology to examine unit and local field potential (LFP) activity in PL and IL before and after auditory discrimination learning and during later retrieval and extinction testing in anesthetized rats. Animals received repeated presentations of two distinct sounds, one of which was paired with footshock (US). In separate control experiments animals received footshocks without sounds. After discrimination learning the paired (CS+) and unpaired (CS−) sounds were repeatedly presented alone. We found increased unit firing and LFP power in PL and, to a lesser extent, IL after discrimination learning but not after footshocks alone. After discrimination learning, unit firing and LFP power increased in PL and IL in response to presentation of the first CS+, compared to the first CS−. However, PL and IL activity increased during the last CS− presentation, such that activity during presentation of the last CS+ and CS− did not differ. These results confirm previous findings and extend them by showing that increased PL and IL activity result from encoding of the CS+/US association rather than US presentation. They also suggest that extinction may occur under anesthesia and might be represented at the neural level in PL and IL.

AB  - Abstract
Throughout human history, economic bubbles have formed and burst. As a bubble grows, microeconomic behavior ceases to be constrained by realistic predictions. This contradicts the basic assumption of economics that agents have rational expectations. To examine the neural basis of behavior during bubbles, we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging while participants traded shares in a virtual stock exchange with two non-bubble stocks and one bubble stock. The price was largely deflected from the fair price in one of the non-bubble stocks, but not in the other. Their fair prices were specified. The price of the bubble stock showed a large increase and battering, as based on a real stock-market bust. The imaging results revealed modulation of the brain circuits that regulate trade behavior under different market conditions. The premotor cortex was activated only under a market condition in which the price was largely deflected from the fair price specified. During the bubble, brain regions associated with the cognitive processing that supports order decisions were identified. The asset preference that might bias the decision was associated with the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The activity of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) was correlated with the score of future time perspective, which would bias the estimation of future price. These regions were deemed to form a distinctive network during the bubble. A functional connectivity analysis showed that the connectivity between the DLPFC and the IPL was predominant compared with other connectivities only during the bubble. These findings indicate that uncertain and unstable market conditions changed brain modes in traders. These brain mechanisms might lead to a loss of control caused by wishful thinking, and to microeconomic bubbles that expand, on the macroscopic scale, toward bust.

AB  - Abstract
Adolescence is an important period for brain development. White matter growth is influenced by sex hormones such as testosterone, and the corpus callosum—the largest white matter structure in the human brain—may change structurally during the hormone-laden period of adolescence. Little is known about puberty’s relationship to structural brain development, even though pubertal stage may better predict cognitive and behavioral maturity than chronological age. We therefore aimed to establish the presence and direction of pubertal effects on callosal anatomy. For this purpose, we applied advanced surface-based mesh-modeling to map correlations between callosal thickness and pubertal stage in a large and well-matched sample of 124 children and adolescents (62 female and 62 male) aged 5–18 years from a normative database. When linking callosal anatomy to pubertal status, only positive correlations reached statistical significance, indicating that callosal growth advances with puberty. In tests of differences in callosal anatomy at different stages of puberty, callosal growth was concentrated in different locations depending on the pubertal stage. Changing levels of circulating sex hormones during different phases of puberty likely contributed to the observed effects, and further research is clearly needed. Direct quantification of sex hormone levels and regional fiber connectivity—ideally using fiber tractography—will reveal whether hormones are the main drivers of callosal change during puberty. These callosal findings may lead to hypotheses regarding cortical changes during puberty, which may promote or result from changes in inter-hemispheric connectivity.

AB  - Abstract
Deliberation between possible options before making a decision is crucial to responding with an optimal choice. However, the neural mechanisms regulating this deliberative decision-making process are still unclear. Recent studies have proposed that the locus coeruleus-noradrenaline (LC-NA) system plays a role in attention, behavioral flexibility, and exploration, which contribute to the search for an optimal choice under uncertain situations. In the present study, we examined whether the LC-NA system relates to the deliberative process in a T-maze spatial decision-making task in rats. To quantify deliberation in rats, we recorded vicarious trial-and-error behavior (VTE), which is considered to reflect a deliberative process exploring optimal choices. In experiment 1, we manipulated the difficulty of choice by varying the amount of reward pellets between the two maze arms (0 vs. 4, 1 vs. 3, 2 vs. 2). A difficulty-dependent increase in VTE was accompanied by a reduction of choice bias toward the high reward arm and an increase in time required to select one of the two arms in the more difficult manipulation. In addition, the increase of c-Fos-positive NA neurons in the LC depended on the task difficulty and the amount of c-Fos expression in LC-NA neurons positively correlated with the occurrence of VTE. In experiment 2, we inhibited LC-NA activity by injection of clonidine, an agonist of the alpha2 autoreceptor, during a decision-making task (1 vs. 3). The clonidine injection suppressed occurrence of VTE in the early phase of the task and subsequently impaired a valuable choice later in the task. These results suggest that the LC-NA system regulates the deliberative process during decision-making.

AB  - Abstract
Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects myelin sheaths within the central nervous system, concurring to cause brain atrophy and neurodegeneration as well as gradual functional disconnections. To explore early signs of altered connectivity in MS from a structural and functional perspective, the morphology of corpus callosum (CC) was correlated with a dynamic inter-hemispheric connectivity index.

Twenty mildly disabled patients affected by a relapsing–remitting (RR) form of MS (EDSS ⩽ 3.5) and 15 healthy subjects underwent structural MRI to measure CC thickness over 100 sections and electroencephalography to assess a spectral coherence index between primary regions devoted to hand control, at rest and during an isometric handgrip.

In patients, an overall CC atrophy was associated with increased lesion load. A less efficacious inter-hemispheric coherence (IHCoh) during movement was associated with CC atrophy in sections interconnecting homologous primary motor areas (anterior mid-body). In healthy controls, less efficacious IHCoh at rest was associated with a thinner CC splenium.

Our data suggest that in mildly disabled RR-MS patients a covert impairment may be detected in the correlation between the structural (CC thickness) and functional (IHCoh) measures of homologous networks, whereas these two counterparts do not yet differ individually from controls.

AB  - Abstract
Amygdala kindling is well known to increase unconditioned fear and anxiety. However, relatively little is known about whether this form of kindling causes functional changes within the neural circuitry that mediates fear learning and the retrieval of fear memories. To address this issue, we examined the effect of short- (i.e., 30 stimulations) and long-term (i.e., 99 stimulations) amygdala kindling in rats on trace and delay fear conditioning, which are aversive learning tasks that rely predominantly on the hippocampus and amygdala, respectively. After memory retrieval, we analyzed the pattern of neural activity with Fos, the protein product of the immediate early gene c-fos. We found that kindling had no effect on acquisition of the trace fear conditioning task but it did selectively impair retrieval of this fear memory. In contrast, kindling disrupted both acquisition and retrieval of fear memory in the delay fear conditioning task. We also found that kindling-induced impairments in memory retrieval were accompanied by decreased Fos expression in several subregions of the hippocampus, parahippocampus, and amygdala. Interestingly, decreased freezing in the trace conditioning task was significantly correlated with dampened Fos expression in hippocampal and parahippocampal regions whereas decreased freezing in the delay conditioning task was significantly correlated with dampened Fos expression in hippocampal, parahippocampal, and amygdaloid circuits. Overall, these results suggest that amygdala kindling promotes functional changes in brain regions involved in specific types of fear learning and memory.

AB  - Abstract
Dual-task interference during gait is a common phenomenon in older adults and people with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Dual-task performance is driven by cognitive processes involving executive function, attention and working memory which underpin resource capacity and allocation. The underlying processes that contribute to dual-task interference are poorly understood, and confounded by methodological differences. The aim of this study was to explore the nature of dual-task interference in PD with respect to age-matched controls. We examined 121 people with early PD and 189 controls and controlled for baseline task demand on both tasks allowing between-group differences to be attributed to dual-task interference rather than differences in baseline performance. We also compared a wide range of gait characteristics to evaluate the pattern of interference. Participants walked for two minutes at a preferred pace under single- and dual-task (test of working memory capacity − digit span recall) conditions. In a subgroup task demand was increased (digit span + 1) (n = 55 control, n = 44 PD) to assess the influence of resource capacity. Finally the association between dual-task interference with motor and cognitive characteristics was examined to evaluate resource capacity and allocation. PD and controls responded similarly to the dual-task for all gait characteristics except for step width and step width variability and this was the same when task demand increased (dual + 1). Control participants took wider steps (p = 0.006) and step width variability increased significantly for controls (p = 0.001) but not PD. Interference was specific to the gait characteristic rather than a global pattern of impairment. Digit span error rates were not significantly different between groups during dual-task performance. There were no significant correlations with dual-task interference and global cognition, motor deficit, and executive function for either group. Effects of dual-tasks on gait performance are twofold and specific to the gait characteristic. They reflect an age-related reduction in gait performance (especially forward progression) in PD and controls possibly due to reduced resource capacity; and secondly, show postural stability during walking in early PD is disproportionately affected highlighting a PD-specific dual-task co-ordination deficit. Further work is required to identify the cognitive, executive and motor correlates of dual-task interference from which inferences about underlying cognitive processes can be made. These findings inform an understanding of dual-task impairment in early PD and suggest that management should target postural control under dual-task conditions from the early stages.

AB  - Abstract
An increasing body of experimental evidence demonstrates that the glutamatergic system is involved in the genesis of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia (LID). Indeed, the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist amantadine is the only anti-dyskinetic compound used in patients, albeit with limited efficacy and side effects. In this study, we investigated the anti-dyskinetic properties of memantine, a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist in clinical use for the treatment of dementia, in the 6-hydroxy-dopamine (6-OHDA)-lesion rat model of Parkinson’s disease. For comparison, parallel experiments were also performed with amantadine.

First, we investigated the acute effect of different doses of memantine (5, 10, 15 and 20 mg/kg), and amantadine (10, 20, 40, 60 mg/kg) on established dyskinesia induced by L-DOPA (6 mg/kg plus benserazide). Results showed that both memantine and amantadine produced a significant reduction of LID. Afterward, drug-naïve and L-DOPA-primed 6-OHDA-lesioned rats were sub-chronically treated with daily injections of L-DOPA (6 mg/kg plus benserazide) alone, or in combination with the effective doses of memantine, while amantadine was tested in already dyskinetic rats. Results showed that memantine significantly dampened dyskinesia in both drug-naïve and L-DOPA-primed rats, but only during the first few days of administration. In fact, the anti-dyskinetic effect of memantine was completely lost already at the fifth administration, indicating a rapid induction of tolerance. Interestingly, a 3-week washout period was not sufficient to restore the anti-dyskinetic effect of the drug. Similarly, amantadine was able to dampen already established dyskinesia only during the first day of administration. Moreover, memantine partially decreased the therapeutic effect of L-DOPA, as showed by the result of the stepping test. Finally, loss of the anti-dyskinetic effect of memantine was associated to increased synaptic GluN2A/GluN2B ratio at striatal synaptic membranes.

Our results are in line with clinical observations suggesting that NMDA receptor blockade may only be transiently effective against LID in PD patients.

AB  - Abstract
Autism is a developmental disorder defined by the presence of a triad of communication, social and stereo typical behavioral characteristics with onset before 3 years of age. In spite of the fact that there are potential environmental factors for autistic behavior, the dysfunction of serotonin during early development of the brain could be playing a role in this prevalence rise. Serotonin can modulate a number of developmental events, including cell division, neuronal migration, cell differentiation and synaptogenesis. Hyperserotonemia during fetal development results in the loss of serotonin terminals through negative feedback. The increased serotonin causes a decrease of oxytocin in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and an increase in calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the central nucleus of the amygdale, which are associated with social interactions and vital in autism. However, hyposerotonemia may be also relevant to the development of sensory as well as motor and cognitive faculties. And the paucity of placenta-derived serotonin should have potential importance when the pathogenesis of autism is considered. This review briefly summarized the developmental disruptions of serotonin signaling involved in the pathogenesis of autism during early development of the brain.

AB  - Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive and degenerative disorder accompanied by cognitive impairment, but effective strategies against AD are currently not available. Interestingly, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) used in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has shown neuroprotective effects in preclinical studies of AD. Lixisenatide, an effective GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist with much longer half life than GLP-1, has been licensed in the EU as a treatment for T2DM. However, the neuroprotective effects of lixisenatide in the brain remain to be clarified. In the present study, we report for the first time the effects of lixisenatide on the amyloid β (Aβ) protein-induced impairments in spatial learning and memory of rats, and investigated its electrophysiological and molecular mechanisms. We found that: (1) bilateral intrahippocampal injection of Aβ25–35 resulted in a significant decline in spatial learning and memory of rats, as well as a suppression of in vivo hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP); (2) lixisenatide treatment effectively prevented the Aβ25–35-induced impairments; (3) lixisenatide inhibited the Aβ25–35 injection-induced activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), with a significant increase in the phosphorylation of ser9 and a significant decrease in the phosphorylation of Y216. These results indicate that lixisenatide, by affecting the PI3K-Akt-GSK3β pathway, can prevent Aβ-related impairments in synaptic plasticity and spatial memory of rats, suggesting that lixisenatide may be a novel and effective treatment for AD.

AB  - Abstract
Opiate analgesia in the spinal cord is impaired during neuropathic pain. We hypothesized that this is caused by a decrease in μ-opioid receptor inhibition of neurotransmitter release from primary afferents. To investigate this possibility, we measured substance P release in the spinal dorsal horn as neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) internalization in rats with chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. Noxious stimulation of the paw with CCI produced inconsistent NK1R internalization, suggesting that transmission of nociceptive signals by the injured nerve was variably impaired after CCI. This idea was supported by the fact that CCI produced only small changes in the ability of exogenous substance P to induce NK1R internalization or in the release of substance P evoked centrally from site of nerve injury.

In subsequent experiments, NK1R internalization was induced in spinal cord slices by stimulating the dorsal root ipsilateral to CCI. We observed a complete loss of the inhibition of substance P release by the μ-opioid receptor agonist [D-Ala2, NMe-Phe4, Gly-ol5]-enkephalin (DAMGO) in CCI rats but not in sham-operated rats. In contrast, DAMGO still inhibited substance P release after inflammation of the hind paw with complete Freund’s adjuvant and in naïve rats. This loss of inhibition was not due to μ-opioid receptor downregulation in primary afferents, because their colocalization with substance P was unchanged, both in dorsal root ganglion neurons and primary afferent fibers in the dorsal horn. In conclusion, nerve injury eliminates the inhibition of substance P release by μ-opioid receptors, probably by hindering their signaling mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract
Dorsal norepinephrine bundle (DNEB) is the major source of noradrenergic input to the hippocampus and norepinephrine could regulate long-term potentiation (LTP) reversal. In the present study, we investigated the effects of low-frequency stimulation (LFS) of DNEB on behavioral LTP and Y-maze learning task, by using electrophysiological recording in freely moving rats combined with behavioral tests. We found that LFS on DNEB, including 1 and 5 Hz, could inhibit reversibly basal synaptic transmission within 100-min recordings in hippocampal perforant path projections to dentate gyrus (PP-DG) pathway. 1-Hz stimulating DNEB, delivered 5 min after the daily training session, reverses behavioral LTP completely and depresses the behavioral learning as well. However, 5-Hz-treated only reverses behavioral LTP partially and reduces the behavioral learning accordingly. These results indicate that behavioral LTP in PP-DG pathway can be reversed by LFS on DNEB, and display a similar impact on Y-maze learning performance. Our data provide a new characterization of LTP reversibility and will ultimately be helpful in understanding how new information is to detect and determine storage in the hippocampus.

AB  - Abstract
We investigated the effect of taurine on inflammatory cytokine expression, on astrocyte activity and cerebral edema and functional outcomes, following traumatic brain injury (TBI) in rats. 72 rats were randomly divided into sham, TBI and Taurine groups. Rats subjected to moderate lateral fluid percussion injury were injected intravenously with taurine (200 mg/kg) or saline immediately after injury or daily for 7 days. Functional outcome was evaluated using Modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS). Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) of the brain was measured using immunofluorescence. Concentration of 23 cytokines and chemokines in the injured cortex at 1 and 7 days after TBI was assessed by Luminex xMAP technology. The results showed that taurine significantly improved functional recovery except 1 day, reduced accumulation of GFAP and water content in the penumbral region at 7 days after TBI. Compared with the TBI group, taurine significantly suppressed growth-related oncogene (GRO/KC) and interleukin (IL)-1β levels while elevating the levels of regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) at 1 day. And taurine markedly decreased the level of 17 cytokine: eotaxin, Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17, leptin, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and only increased the level of MIP-1α in a week. The results suggest that taurine effectively mitigates the severity of brain damage in TBI by attenuating the increase of astrocyte activity and edema as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines.

AB  - Abstract
Vasopressin (VP), oxytocin (OXT) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) in the brain modulate physiological and behavioral processes in many vertebrates. Day-active tree shrews, the closest relatives of primates, live singly or in pairs in territories that they defend vigorously against intruding conspecifics. However, anatomy concerning peptidergic neuron distribution in the tree shrew brain is less clear. Here, we examined the distribution of VP, OXT and VIP immunoreactivity in the hypothalamus and extrahypothalamic regions of tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) using the immunohistochemical techniques. Most of VP and OXT immunoreactive (-ir) neurons were found in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus. In addition, VP-ir or OXT-ir neurons were scattered in the preoptic area, anterior hypothalamic areas, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, stria terminalis, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and medial amygdala. Interestingly, a high density of VP-ir fibers within the ventral lateral septum was observed in males but not in females. Both VP-ir and VIP-ir neurons were found in different subdivisions of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) with partial overlap. VIP-ir cells and fibers were also scattered in the cerebral cortex, anterior olfactory nucleus, amygdala and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. These findings provide a comprehensive description of VIP and a detailed mapping of VP and OXT in the hypothalamus and extrahypothalamic regions of tree shrews, which is an anatomical basis for the participation of these neuropeptides in the regulation of circadian behavior and social behavior.

AB  - Abstract
Aversive social interactions, such as social defeat, can alter a variety of behavioral and cognitive functions. In the present study, we examined the effects of social defeat and the subsequent housing on behavior as well as cell proliferation and cell survival in the solitary, male greater long-tailed hamster (Tscheskia triton). We found that three days of agonistic interactions reliably led to a subordinate-dominant relationship between pairs of male hamsters. However, such behavioral interactions did not alter cell proliferation in any of the brain areas examined. In addition, subordinate males housed in close proximity to the dominant male (separated by a wire screen) following social defeat did not display differences in agonistic behaviors, but had enhanced cell proliferation in the anterior hypothalamus, ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), and amygdala as well as increased cell survival in the VMH, compared to subordinate males that were housed individually. Together, our data indicate distinct effects of agonistic interactions and the social housing condition on behavior as well as cell proliferation and survival in the brain of the greater long-tailed hamster.

AB  - Abstract
Dopamine D2-autoreceptors play a key role in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons and control the synthesis, release and uptake of dopamine. These Gi/o-coupled inhibitory receptors play a major part in shaping dopamine transmission. Found at both somatodendritic and axonal sites, autoreceptors regulate the firing patterns of dopamine neurons and control the timing and amount of dopamine released from their terminals in target regions. Alterations in the expression and activity of autoreceptors are thought to contribute to Parkinson’s disease as well as schizophrenia, drug addiction and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which emphasizes the importance of D2-autoreceptors in regulating the dopamine system. This review will summarize the cellular actions of dopamine autoreceptors and discuss recent advances that have furthered our understanding of the mechanisms by which D2-receptors control dopamine transmission.

AB  - Abstract
We have previously shown expression of the protein doublecortin (DCX) in unipolar brush cells (UBCs) in the dorsal cochlear nucleus and vestibulocerebellum of the adult rat. We also saw DCX-immunoreactive elements with the appearance of neuroblasts around the fourth ventricle. Expression of DCX is seen in newborn and migrating neurons and hence considered a correlate of neurogenesis. There were two interpretations of the expression of DCX in UBCs. One possibility is that there might be adult neurogenesis of this cell population. Adult neurogenesis is now well-established, but only for the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone. The other possibility is that there is prolonged expression of DCX in adult UBCs that may signal a unique role in plasticity of these neurons. We tested the neurogenesis hypothesis by systemic injections of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a thymidine analog, followed by immunohistochemistry to examine the numbers and locations of dividing cells. We used several different injection paradigms, varying the dose of BrdU, the number of injections and the survival time to assess the possibility of neuronal birth and migration. We saw BrdU-labeled cells in the cerebellum and brainstem; cell division in these regions was confirmed by immunohistochemistry for the protein Ki67. However, neither the numbers nor the distribution of labeled nuclei support the idea of adult neurogenesis and migration of UBCs. The function of DCX expression in UBC’s in the adult remains to be understood.

AB  - Abstract
The spinal cord is vulnerable to ischemic injury due to trauma, vascular malformations and correction of thoracic aortic lesions. Riluzole, a sodium channel blocker and anti-glutamate drug has been shown to be neuroprotective in a model of ischemic spinal cord injury, although the effects in clinically relevant ischemia/reperfusion models are unknown. Here, we examine the effect of riluzole following ischemia–reperfusion injury to the spinal cord.

Female rats underwent high thoracic aortic balloon occlusion to produce an ischemia/reperfusion injury. Tolerance to ischemia was evaluated by varying the duration of occlusion. Riluzole (8 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally 4 h after injury. Locomotor function (Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scale) was assessed at 4 h, 1 day, and 5 days post-ischemia. Spinal cords were extracted and evaluated for neuronal loss using immunohistology (choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and neuronal nuclei (NeuN)), inflammation (CD11b), astrogliosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein – GFAP) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL).

Ischemic injury lasting between 5.5 and 6.75 min resulted in delayed paraplegia, whereas longer ischemia induced immediate paraplegia. When riluzole was administered to rats that underwent 6 min of occlusion, delayed paraplegia was prevented. The BBB score of riluzole-treated rats was 11.14 ± 4.85 compared with 1.86 ± 1.07 in control animals. Riluzole also reduced neuronal loss, infiltration of microglia/macrophages and astrogliosis in the ventral horn and intermediate zone of the gray matter. In addition, riluzole reduced apoptosis of neurons in the dorsal horn of the gray matter.

Riluzole has a neuroprotective effect in a rat model of spinal cord injury/reperfusion when administered up to 4 h post-injury, a clinically relevant therapeutic time window.

AB  - Abstract
The arcuate nucleus is the main receptive area of the brain for peripheral and central metabolic cues and its integrity is essential for the maintenance of energy homeostasis. In the arcuate nucleus, different neuronal populations process metabolic signals and transmit this information to other nuclei of the hypothalamus by means of neurotransmitters and a combination of neuropeptides whose expression is modulated by the nutritional status. Here we investigated the changes in expression and synthesis of the polypeptide VGF in the arcuate nucleus of rats, in relation to the two main categories of neurons that show colocalization with VGF: the orexigenic NPY-expressing cells and the anorexigenic POMC-expressing cells. The results show that fasting is the most important stimulus for VGF expression, and that the up-regulation of VGF mRNA is restricted to the NPY area of the arcuate nucleus. POMC neurons express VGF under all feeding conditions, but especially in ad libitum-fed and fasted-refed animals. We also show that VGF arcuate neurons project to the pre-autonomic neurons of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, providing anatomical evidence suggesting VGF as a central modulator of the autonomic nervous system.

AB  - Abstract
Neonatal alcohol exposure impairs cognition and learning in adulthood and permanently damages the hippocampus. Wheel running (WR) improves hippocampus-associated learning and memory and increases the genesis and survival of newly generated neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. WR significantly increases proliferation of newly generated dentate granule cells in alcohol-exposed (AE) and control rats on Postnatal Day (PD) 42 but only control rats show an increased number of surviving cells thirty days after WR (Helfer et al., 2009b). The present studies examined whether proliferation-promoting WR followed by survival-enhancing environmental complexity (EC) during adolescence could increase survival of new neurons in AE rats. On PD 4–9, pups were intubated with alcohol in a binge-like manner (5.25 g/kg/day, AE), were sham-intubated (SI), or were reared normally (suckle control, SC). On PD 30 animals were assigned to WR (PD 30–42) followed by EC (PD 42–72; WR/EC) or were socially housed (SH/SH) for the duration of the experiment. All animals were injected with 200 mg/kg bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) on PD 41. In Experiment 1, survival of newly generated cells was significantly enhanced in the AE-WR/EC group in comparison with AE-SH/SH group. Experiment 2A examined trace eyeblink conditioning. In the SH/SH condition, AE impaired trace eyeblink conditioning relative to SI and SC controls. In the WR/EC condition, AE rats performed as well as controls. In Experiment 2B, the same intervention was examined using the context preexposure facilitation effect (CPFE); a hippocampus-dependent variant of contextual fear conditioning. Again, the WR/EC intervention reversed the deficit in conditioned fear to the context that was evident in the SH/SH condition. Post-weaning environmental manipulations promote cell survival and reverse learning deficits in rats that were exposed to alcohol during development. These manipulations may provide a basis for developing interventions that ameliorate learning impairments associated with human fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Restrained eaters (REs) characterized by less efficient response inhibition are at risk for future onset of binge eating and bulimic pathology. Previous imaging studies investigating REs have been based on task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and little is known about resting-state neural activity underlying restrained eating. To illuminate this issue, we investigated resting-state fMRI differences between REs (n = 22) and unrestrained eaters (UREs) (n = 30) using regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis, which measures the temporal synchronization of spontaneous fluctuations. Samples were equated on body mass index (BMI) and caloric deprivation levels (i.e., 14 ± 2.1 h since last evening meal) before undergoing fMRI. Correlation analyses were performed between the ReHo index of identified regions and response inhibition based on stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) within each sample. Compared with UREs, REs showed more ReHo in brain regions associated with food reward (i.e., orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)), attention (i.e., lingual gyrus, cuneus, inferior parietal lobule) and somatosensory functioning (i.e., paracentral lobule, anterior insula). In addition, ReHo values for the left dlPFC and left anterior insula, respectively, were negatively and positively correlated with SSRT among REs but not UREs. In concert with previous studies, these results suggest altered local synchronization may help to explain why dieting to maintain or lose weight often fails or increases risk for binge eating among REs.

AB  - Abstract
CHF5074 is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory derivative that has been shown to inhibit β-amyloid plaque deposition and to reverse memory deficit in vivo in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

In the present in vivo study we used pre-plaque Tg2576 mice showing cognitive impairments to investigate the effects of a sub-acute treatment with CHF5074 on prefrontal cortex dialysate glutamate levels. Furthermore, the effects of CHF5074 have been compared with those induced, under the same experimental conditions, by LY450139, a potent γ-secretase inhibitor, that has been shown to inhibit brain β-amyloid production.

No differences in prefrontal cortex dialysate glutamate levels were observed between control Tg2576 and wild-type animals. A sub-acute (8 days) treatment with CHF5074 (30 mg/kg, s.c.), LY450139 (3 mg/kg, s.c.) or their respective vehicles did not modify prefrontal cortex dialysate glutamate levels. After these treatments, the injection of CHF5074 reduced, while LY450139 increased, prefrontal cortex dialysate glutamate levels in Tg2576 mice, but not in wild-type animals.

These results suggest that at the dose tested CHF5074 and LY450139 differently affect cortical glutamate transmission in pre-plaque Tg2576 mice. This different neurochemical profile could be involved in the different ability of the two drugs in improving early cognitive performance in this animal model of AD.

AB  - Abstract
Animals with low and high immobility in the forced swimming test (FST) differ in a number of neurobehavioral factors. A growing body of evidence suggests that the exposure to enriched environments mediates a number of changes in the brain. Therefore, we studied if animals’ individuality can somehow modulate the response to environmental stimuli. Male rats were classified according to their immobility time scores in the FST test session as animals with low, medium or high immobility. Then, rats from groups with low and high immobility were randomly distributed in two groups to be reared in different housing conditions (i.e., enriched and standard conditions) during 8 weeks. Animals were subjected to the open field test (OFT) before and 6 weeks after the start of housing protocol. Rats with high immobility in the FST also showed high ambulation and high rearing time in the first OFT. Such findings were not observed in the second OFT. Conversely, an effect of environmental enrichment was found in the second OFT where enriched animals showed lower ambulation and higher grooming time than the standard control group. Rats were sacrificed after the housing protocol and neurochemical content and/or gene expression were studied in three different brain regions: the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus and the nucleus accumbens. Rats with low immobility showed significantly higher accumbal 5-HT levels than animals with high immobility, whereas no neurochemical differences were observed between enriched and standard animals. Regarding expression data, however, an effect of enrichment on accumbal corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and its receptor 1 (CRFR1) levels was observed, and such effect depended on immobility levels. Thus, our results not only allowed us to identify a number of differences between animals with low and high immobility or animals housed in standard and enriched conditions, but also suggested that animals’ individuality modulated in some way the response to environmental stimuli.

AB  - AbstractAims
Patients receiving paclitaxel often develop peripheral neuropathies. We found that a novel selective cannabinoid CB2 receptor agonist (MDA7) prevents paclitaxel-induced mechanical allodynia in rats and mice. Here we investigated gene expression profiling in the lumbar spinal cord after 14-day treatment of MDA7 in paclitaxel animals and analyzed possible signaling pathways underlying the preventive effect of MDA7 on paclitaxel-induced neuropathy.
Methods
Peripheral mechanical allodynia was induced in rats or mice receiving intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of paclitaxel at a dose of 1 mg/kg daily for four consecutive days. MDA7 was administered at a dose of 15 mg/kg 15 min before paclitaxel and then continued daily for another 10 days. Whole-genome gene expression profiling in the lumbar spinal cord of MDA7 and paclitaxel-treated rats was investigated using microarray analysis. The Ingenuity pathway analysis was performed to determine the potential relevant canonical pathways responsible for the effect of MDA7 on paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy.
Results
We observed that the inflammatory molecular networks including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling are most relevant to the preventive effect of MDA7 on paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy. In addition, genes encoding molecules that are important in central sensitization such as glutamate transporters and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 2B (NMDAR2B), and neuro-immune-related genes such as neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS1), chemokine CX3CL1 (a mediator for microglial activation), toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), and leptin were differentially modulated by MDA7.
Conclusion
The preventive effect of MDA7 on paclitaxel-induced peripheral allodynia in rats may be associated with genes involved in signal pathways in central sensitization, microglial activation, and neuroinflammation in the spinal cord.

AB  - Abstract
The 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine) system has been assigned a key role in the development of 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-l-alanine (l-DOPA)-induced dyskinesia, mainly due to 5-HT neuronal ability to decarboxylate l-DOPA into dopamine. Nevertheless, knowledge of l-DOPA-induced events that could lead to development of dyskinesias are limited and therefore the present work has evaluated (i) the role of the 5-HT system in l-DOPA-derived dopamine synthesis when dopamine neurons are present, (ii) l-DOPA-induced effects on striatal dopamine release and clearance, and on 5-HT nerve fiber density, and (iii) the behavioral outcome of altered 5-HT transmission in dyskinetic rats. Chronoamperometric recordings demonstrated attenuated striatal l-DOPA-derived dopamine release (∼30%) upon removal of 5-HT nerve fibers in intact animals. Interestingly, four weeks of daily l-DOPA treatment yielded similar-sized dopamine peak amplitudes in intact animals as found after a 5-HT-lesion. Moreover, chronic l-DOPA exposure attenuated striatal 5-HT nerve fiber density in the absence of dopamine nerve terminals. Furthermore, fluoxetine-induced altered 5-HT transmission blocked dyskinetic behavior via action on 5-HT1A receptors. Taken together, the results indicate a central role for the 5-HT system in l-DOPA-derived dopamine synthesis and in dyskinesia, and therefore potential l-DOPA-induced deterioration of 5-HT function might reduce l-DOPA efficacy as well as promote the upcoming of motor side effects.

AB  - Abstract
The interactions between the cannabinoid and opioid systems for pain modulation are reciprocal. However, the role and the importance of the cannabinoid system in the antinociceptive effects of opioids remain uncertain. We studied these interactions with the goal of highlighting the involvement of the cannabinoid system in morphine-induced analgesia. In both phases of the formalin test, intra paw and intrathecal morphine produced similar antinociceptive effects in C57BL/6, cannabinoid type 1 and type 2 receptor wild-type (respectively cnr1WT and cnr2WT) mice. In cnr1 and cnr2 knockout (KO) mice, at the dose used the antinociceptive effect of intra paw morphine in the inflammatory phase of the formalin test was decreased by 87% and 76%, respectively. Similarly, the antinociceptive effect of 0.1 μg spinal morphine in the inflammatory phase was abolished in cnr1KO mice and decreased by 90% in cnr2KO mice. Interestingly, the antinociceptive effect of morphine in the acute phase of the formalin test was only reduced in cnr1KO mice. Notably, systemic morphine administration produced similar analgesia in all genotypes, in both the formalin and the hot water immersion tail-flick tests. Because the pattern of expression of the mu opioid receptor (MOP), its binding properties and its G protein coupling remained unchanged across genotypes, it is unlikely that the loss of morphine analgesia in the cnr1KO and cnr2KO mice is the consequence of MOP malfunction or downregulation due to the absence of its heterodimerization with either the CB1 or the CB2 receptors, at least at the level of the spinal cord.

AB  - Abstract
Next generation sequencing technologies have facilitated a notable shift from common disease common variant hypothesis to common disease rare variant, as also witnessed in recent literature on schizophrenia. Dopamine receptor D4 (DRD4), a G-protein-coupled receptor is associated with psychiatric disorders and has high affinity for atypical antipsychotic clozapine. We investigated the functional role of rare genetic variants in DRD4 which may have implications for translational medicine. CHO-K1 cells independently expressing four rare non-synonymous variants of DRD4 namely R237L, A281P, S284G located in the third cytosolic loop and V194G, located in the fifth transmembrane domain were generated. Their genotype–phenotype correlations were evaluated using [3H]spiperone binding, G-protein activation and molecular dynamics-simulation studies. A281P and S284G were functionally similar to wildtype (WT). With R237L, potency of dopamine and quinpirole reduced ∼sixfold and threefold respectively compared to WT; [3H]spiperone binding studies showed a reduction in total number of binding sites (∼40%) but not binding affinity, in silico docking studies revealed that binding of both dopamine and spiperone to R237L was structurally similar to WT. Of note, V194G variant failed to inhibit forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity and phosphorylate extracellular signal-regulated kinase; showed significant reduction in binding affinity (Kd = 2.16 nM) and total number of binding sites (∼66%) compared to WT in [3H]spiperone binding studies; and ligand docking studies showed that binding of dopamine and spiperone is superficial due to probable structural alteration. Transmembrane variant V194G in DRD4.4 results in functional alteration warranting continuing functional analysis of rare variants.

AB  - Abstract
Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute, post-infectious, immune-mediated, demyelinating disease of peripheral nerves and nerve roots. Experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) is an animal model of GBS. Chrysin, which is a naturally occurring flavonoid, exhibits various biological activities. This study was designed to investigate the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties of preventative and therapeutic chrysin treatment in EAN rats. For preventative treatment, chrysin was administered orally from day 1 to day 16 (50 mg/kg once daily) while, for therapeutic treatment, rats received chrysin from day 7 to day 16 at the same dose once daily. Control animals received the same volume of the vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline/2% dimethylsulfoxide). Regardless of the treatment regimen, chrysin attenuated the severity and duration of the clinical course of EAN and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and demyelination of sciatic nerves. In the sciatic nerves, the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2 and nuclear factor kappa B was reduced. Furthermore, chrysin inhibited the splenic mononuclear cell secretion of interleukin-1β, interleukin-2, interleukin-6, inteleukin-12, interferon γ and tumor necrosis factor α, and elevated the level of inteleukin-4. In summary, our data demonstrate that chrysin is a potentially useful agent for the treatment of EAN with its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects.

AB  - Abstract
The central melanocortin system plays an essential role in the regulation of energy balance. While anorexigenic effects of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) acting in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), a critical medullary autonomic control center, have been established, the cellular events underlying these effects are less well characterized. In this study, we used whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology to examine firstly whether α-MSH exerts direct postsynaptic effects on the membrane potential of rat NTS neurons in slice preparation, and secondly whether α-MSH influences GABAergic signaling in the NTS. In normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid, perfusion of α-MSH (500 nM) resulted in a depolarization in 39% of cells (n = 16, mean 6.14 ± 0.54 mV), and a hyperpolarization in 22% of cells (n = 9, −6.79 ± 1.02 mV). Studies using tetrodotoxin to block neuronal communication revealed α-MSH exerts direct depolarizing effects on some NTS neurons, and indirect inhibitory effects on others. A third subset of neurons is simultaneously directly depolarized and indirectly hyperpolarized by α-MSH, resulting in a net lack of effect on membrane potential. The inhibitory inputs influenced by α-MSH were identified as GABAergic, as α-MSH increased the frequency, but not amplitude, of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in 50% of NTS neurons. α-MSH had no effect on the frequency or amplitude of miniature IPSCs. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of GABAA and GABAB receptors, and physical removal of all synaptic inputs via cellular dissociation, abolished hyperpolarizations induced by α-MSH. We conclude α-MSH exerts direct, postsynaptic excitatory effects on a subset of NTS neurons. By exciting GABAergic NTS neurons and presynaptically enhancing GABAergic signaling, α-MSH also indirectly inhibits other NTS cells. These findings provide critical insight into the cellular events underlying medullary melanocortin anorexigenic effects, and expand the understanding of the circuitries involved in central melanocortin signaling.

AB  - Abstract
Subjective tinnitus is a chronic neurological disorder in which phantom sounds are perceived. Recent evidence supports the hypothesis that tinnitus is related to neuronal hyperactivity in auditory brain regions, and consequently drugs that increase GABAergic neurotransmission in the CNS, such as the GABAB receptor agonist l-baclofen, may be effective as a treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of early (5 mg/kg s.c., 30 min and then every 24 h for 5 days following noise exposure) and late treatment (3 mg/kg/day s.c. for 4.5 weeks starting at 17.5 weeks following noise exposure) with l-baclofen on the psychophysical attributes of tinnitus in a conditioned lick suppression model following acoustic trauma in rats. Acoustic trauma (a 16-kHz, 115-dB pure tone presented unilaterally for 1 h) resulted in a significant decrease in the suppression ratio (SR) compared to sham controls in response to 20-kHz tones at 2, 10 and 17.5 weeks post-exposure (P ⩽ 0.009, P ⩽ 0.02 and P ⩽ 0.03, respectively). However, l-baclofen failed to prevent the development of tinnitus when administered during the first 5 days following the acoustic trauma and also failed to reverse it when treatment was carried out every day for 4.5 weeks. We also found that treatment with l-baclofen did not alter the expression of the GABAB-R2 subunit in the cochlear nucleus of noise-exposed animals.

AB  - Abstract
Recently we demonstrated that it is possible to influence tactile perception by applying a placebo manipulation consisting of verbal suggestion and conditioning and that this influence is associated to changes in the late components (N140 and P200) of somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) (Fiorio et al., 2012). Due to the powerful effects of words in changing symptoms perception in the clinical domain, aim of this study was to investigate whether even in the tactile modality, perception can be changed by the mere use of persuasive words in a specific context. To this purpose, we adopted the same experimental setting of our previous study, apart from the conditioning procedure. A group of subjects (experimental group) has been verbally suggested about the effect of an inert cream in enhancing tactile perception, while a control group was informed about the inefficacy of the cream. In order to unveil the neurophysiological underpinnings of this effect, we compared the amplitude of late SEPs (P100, N140, P200), before and after treatment. Results showed that the experimental group did not perceive an increase of tactile sensation after the treatment and no modification occurred in the late SEPs. This study proves that verbal suggestion alone is not sufficient to induce enhanced tactile perception (at least with this experimental setting), suggesting that a conditioning procedure may be necessary in the tactile modality. The absence of changes in the late SEP components could reflect the lack of strong expectation following the placebo procedure.

AB  - AbstractAims
Not all the mechanisms by which subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) alleviates parkinsonian symptoms have been clarified as yet. The levels of striatal monoamine and the subthalamic beta activity might contribute to its efficacy. However, their direct relationship is unclear. We aimed to examine the correlation between the striatal monoamine and the STN beta activity induced by STN-DBS.
Experimental procedures
Experiments were performed under urethane anesthesia in normal (n = 4) and 6-hydroxydopamine hemi-lesioned Parkinson’s disease (PD) model rats (n = 5). STN-DBS was applied to the left STN, and local field potential (LFP) was recorded before and after STN-DBS. Striatal extracellular fluid was collected before, during, and after STN-DBS. Spectral analysis of STN-LFP was performed, and the levels of monoamine were measured.
Results
The levels of 3–4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) were significantly decreased after the cessation of stimulation in PD model rats. The levels of none of the monoamines were significantly affected in normal rats. The STN beta power was significantly elevated after the cessation of stimulation in normal rats but was significantly decreased in PD model rats.

The STN beta power and the levels of DOPAC and 5-HT was positively correlated in PD model rats, whereas the levels of dopamine and 5-HT showed positive correlation and the levels of DOPAC and Homovanillic acid (HVA) showed negative correlation in normal rats.
Conclusion
STN-DBS could decrease the levels of DOPAC and the STN beta power in a PD model rat. The STN beta power and the levels of striatal monoamine might be differentially correlated between normal and PD model rats.

How does our mind produce physical, goal-directed action of our body? For about 200 years, philosophers and psychologists hypothesized the transformation from mind to body to rely on the anticipation of an action’s sensory consequences. Whereas this hypothesis received tremendous support from behavioral experiments, the neural underpinnings of action control via such ideomotor effect anticipations are virtually unknown. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the present study identified the inferior parietal cortex and the parahippocampal gyrus as key regions for this type of action control – setting the stage for a neuroscientific framework for explaining action control by ideomotor effect anticipations and thus enabling a synthesis of psychological and neuroscientific approaches to human action.

AB  - Abstract
The dystonias are a group of disorders defined by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions that result in involuntary posturing or repetitive movements. There are many different clinical manifestations and causes. Although they traditionally have been ascribed to dysfunction of the basal ganglia, recent evidence has suggested dysfunction may originate from other regions, particularly the cerebellum. This recent evidence has led to an emerging view that dystonia is a network disorder that involves multiple brain regions. The new network model for the pathogenesis of dystonia has raised many questions, particularly regarding the role of the cerebellum. For example, if dystonia may arise from cerebellar dysfunction, then why are there no cerebellar signs in dystonia? Why are focal cerebellar lesions or degenerative cerebellar disorders more commonly associated with ataxia rather than dystonia? Why is dystonia more commonly associated with basal ganglia lesions rather than cerebellar lesions? Can answers obtained from animals be extrapolated to humans? Is there any evidence that the cerebellum is not involved? Finally, what is the practical value of this new model of pathogenesis for the neuroscientist and clinician? This article explores potential answers to these questions.

AB  - Abstract
α-Tocopherol (vitamin E) is an essential dietary antioxidant with important neuroprotective functions. α-Tocopherol deficiency manifests primarily in neurological pathologies, notably cerebellar dysfunctions such as spinocerebellar ataxia. To study the roles of α-tocopherol in the cerebellum, we used the α-tocopherol transfer protein for the murine version (Ttpa−/−) mice which lack the α-tocopherol transfer protein (TTP) and are a faithful model of vitamin E deficiency and oxidative stress. When fed vitamin E-deficient diet, Ttpa−/− mice had un-detectable levels of α-tocopherol in plasma and several brain regions. Dietary supplementation with α-tocopherol normalized plasma levels of the vitamin, but only modestly increased its levels in the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex, indicating a critical function of brain TTP. Vitamin E deficiency caused an increase in cerebellar oxidative stress evidenced by increased protein nitrosylation, which was prevented by dietary supplementation with the vitamin. Concomitantly, vitamin E deficiency precipitated cellular atrophy and diminished dendritic branching of Purkinje neurons, the predominant output regulator of the cerebellar cortex. The anatomic decline induced by vitamin E deficiency was paralleled by behavioral deficits in motor coordination and cognitive functions that were normalized upon vitamin E supplementation. These observations underscore the essential role of vitamin E and TTP in maintaining CNS function, and support the notion that α-tocopherol supplementation may comprise an effective intervention in oxidative stress-related neurological disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) is caused mainly by the hypofunction of the inner ear, but recent findings point also toward a central component of presbycusis. We used MR morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with a 3 T MR system with the aim to study the state of the central auditory system in a group of elderly subjects (&gt;65 years) with mild presbycusis, in a group of elderly subjects with expressed presbycusis and in young controls. Cortical reconstruction, volumetric segmentation and auditory pathway tractography were performed. Three parameters were evaluated by morphometry: the volume of the gray matter, the surface area of the gyrus and the thickness of the cortex. In all experimental groups the surface area and gray matter volume were larger on the left side in Heschl’s gyrus and planum temporale and slightly larger in the gyrus frontalis superior, whereas they were larger on the right side in the primary visual cortex. Almost all of the measured parameters were significantly smaller in the elderly subjects in Heschl’s gyrus, planum temporale and gyrus frontalis superior. Aging did not change the side asymmetry (laterality) of the gyri. In the central part of the auditory pathway above the inferior colliculus, a trend toward an effect of aging was present in the axial vector of the diffusion (L1) variable of DTI, with increased values observed in elderly subjects. A trend toward a decrease of L1 on the left side, which was more pronounced in the elderly groups, was observed. The effect of hearing loss was present in subjects with expressed presbycusis as a trend toward an increase of the radial vectors (L2L3) in the white matter under Heschl’s gyrus. These results suggest that in addition to peripheral changes, changes in the central part of the auditory system in elderly subjects are also present; however, the extent of hearing loss does not play a significant role in the central changes.

AB  - Abstract
Bipolar disorder is a neuropsychiatric disease characterized by states of mania with or without depression. Pharmacological treatments can be inadequate at regulating mood for many individuals. Melatonin therapy and aerobic exercise are independent prospective therapies for bipolar disorder that have shown potential as mood stabilizers in humans. Myshkin mice (Myk/+) carry a heterozygous missense mutation in the neuronal Na+,K+-ATPase α3 and model mania-related symptoms of bipolar disorder including increased activity, risk-taking behavior and reductions in sleep. One cohort of Myk/+ and wild-type littermates (+/+) was treated with melatonin and a separate cohort was treated with voluntary exercise. Mania-related behavior was assessed in both cohorts. The effect of melatonin on sleep and the effect of exercise on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression in the hippocampus were assayed. Melatonin and voluntary wheel running were both effective at reducing mania-related behavior in Myk/+ but did not affect behavior in +/+. Melatonin increased sleep in Myk/+ and did not change sleep in +/+. Myk/+ showed higher baseline levels of BDNF protein in the hippocampus than +/+. Exercise increased BDNF protein in +/+ hippocampus, while it did not significantly affect BDNF levels in Myk/+ hippocampus. These findings support initial studies in humans indicating that melatonin and exercise are useful independent adjunct therapies for bipolar disorder. Their effects on mood regulation should be further examined in randomized clinical trials. Our results also suggest that hippocampal BDNF may not mediate the effects of exercise on mania-related behavior in the Myk/+ model of mania.

AB  - Abstract
The neuropeptide vasopressin (AVP; arginine-vasopressin) is produced in a handful of brain nuclei located in the hypothalamus and extended amygdala and is released both peripherally as a hormone and within the central nervous system as a neurotransmitter. Central projections have been associated with a number of functions including regulation of physiological homeostasis, control of circadian rhythms, and modulation of social behavior. The AVP neurons located in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and medial amygdala (i.e., extended amygdala) in particular have been associated with affiliative social behavior in multiple species. It was recently demonstrated that in the mouse AVP projections emanating from extended amygdala neurons innervate a number of forebrain and midbrain brain regions including the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR), the site of origin of most forebrain-projecting serotonin neurons. Based on the presence of AVP fibers in the DR, we hypothesized that AVP would alter the physiology of serotonin neurons via AVP 1A receptor (V1AR) activation. Using whole-cell electrophysiology techniques, we found that AVP increased the frequency and amplitude of excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) in serotonin neurons of male mice. The indirect stimulation of serotonin neurons was AMPA/kainate receptor dependent and blocked by the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin, suggesting an effect of AVP on glutamate neurons. Further, the increase in EPSC frequency induced by AVP was blocked by selective V1AR antagonists. Our data suggest that AVP had an excitatory influence on serotonin neurons. This work highlights a new target (i.e., V1AR) for manipulating serotonin neuron excitability. In light of our data, we propose that some of the diverse effects of AVP on physiology and behavior, including social behavior, may be due to activation of the DR serotonin system.

AB  - Abstract
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is implicated in the pathophysiology of psychiatric conditions including major depression and schizophrenia. Mice lacking activity-driven BDNF expression through promoter IV (knock-in promoter IV: KIV) exhibit depression-like behavior, inflexible learning, and impaired response inhibition. Monoamine systems (serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline) are suggested to be involved in depression and schizophrenia since many of the current antidepressants and antipsychotics increase the brain levels of monoamines and/or act on monoamine receptors. To elucidate the impact of activity-driven BDNF on the monoamine systems, we examined mRNA levels for 30 monoamine-related genes, including receptors, transporters, and synthesizing enzymes, in KIV and control wild-type mice by using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). mRNA levels were measured in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, which are regions related to depression and schizophrenia and where promoter IV is active. The frontal cortex of KIV mice showed reduced levels of mRNA expression for serotonin receptors 1b, 2a, and 5b (5HTR1b, 5HTR2a, 5HTR5b), dopamine D2 receptors (DRD2), and adrenergic receptors alpha 1a and 1d (AdRα1a and AdRα1b), but increased levels for serotonin synthesizing enzyme, tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), and dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) when compared to control wild-type mice. The hippocampus of KIV mice showed decreased levels of 5HTR5b. Our results provide causal evidence that lack of promoter IV-driven BDNF disturbs expression of monoaminergic genes in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. These disturbed expression changes in the monoamine systems may mediate the depression- and schizophrenia-like behavior of KIV mice. Our results also suggest that antidepressant and antipsychotic treatments may actually interfere with and normalize the disturbed monoamine systems caused by reduced activity-dependent BDNF, while the treatment responses to these drugs may differ in the subject with reduced BDNF levels caused by stress and lack of neuronal activity.

AB  - Abstract
Extinction is a well-known and important behavioral phenomenon that allows an organism to adapt its behavior to its environment. Previous studies have shown that the expression of extinction is highly context dependent, meanwhile, conditioning context, as part of fear memory, might have influence on extinction formation. To this end, we have conducted four different extinction paradigms in this study: extinction conducted in the conditioning context but tested in another, novel context (AAB); conditioning in one context and extinction and testing in the second (ABB); conditioning in context A, extinction training in context B, but test back to context A (ABA); and extinction training in a third context, context C (ACB). Additionally, a low dose of the GABAA agonist muscimol was used to temporarily inactivate CA1 to observe its effect in extinction. Our results showed that rats under the AAB, but not the ACB or ABA condition, showed a similar level of freezing compared with the typical ABB extinction paradigm. Moreover, muscimol infused into CA1 before extinction training resulted in impaired extinction and down-regulation of NR2B activity and phosphorylated GluR1 (at Ser845) in CA1, and the expression levels of NR2B and GluR1 were decreased significantly in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Thus, CA1 may play an important role in the context-specific expression of fear extinction, and Ser845 may be a phosphorylation site in GluR1 in CA1, triggering the context-specific response of extinction memory.

AB  - Abstract
The study describes for the first time the colocalization pattern of calbindin (CB) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) in the mammillary body (MB) and anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) – structures connected in a topographically organized manner by the mammillothalamic tract (mtt). Immunohistochemical study was performed on fetal (E40, E50, E60), newborn (P0) and postnatal (P20, P80) brains of the guinea pig, but the coexistence pattern of the substances was invariable throughout the examined developmental stages. CB and CART colocalized in the perikarya of the lateral part of the medial mammillary nucleus (MMl), whereas in its medial part (MMm) only CB was detected. In the mtt, which originates from the MB, both the substances were present and colocalized in single fibers. Next, fibers from the mtt spread toward the ATN in a particular way: fibers containing CB ran to both the anteromedial thalamic nucleus (AM) and anteroventral thalamic nucleus (AV), while fibers containing CART ran mostly to the latter one. In the ventral part of AV, CB and CART colocalized vastly in the neuropil. The lateral mammillary nucleus and anterodorsal thalamic nucleus were virtually devoid of CB- and CART-positive structures. Based on the known connections between the MB and ATN, we conclude that the studied substances may cooperate in the MMl–AV part of the axis and CB plays a significant role in the MMm–AM part.

AB  - AbstractObjective
We aimed to determine the effect of distinctly different cognitive tasks and walking speed on cognitive-motor interference of dual-task walking.
Methods
Fifteen healthy adults performed four cognitive tasks: visuomotor reaction time (VMRT) task, word list generation (WLG) task, serial subtraction (SS) task, and the Stroop (STR) task while sitting and during walking at preferred-speed (dual-task normal walking) and slow-speed (dual-task slow-speed walking). Gait speed was recorded to determine effect on walking. Motor and cognitive costs were measured.
Results
Dual-task walking had a significant effect on motor and cognitive parameters. At preferred-speed, the motor cost was lowest for the VMRT task and highest for the STR task. In contrast, the cognitive cost was highest for the VMRT task and lowest for the STR task. Dual-task slow walking resulted in increased motor cost and decreased cognitive cost only for the STR task.
Conclusions
Results show that the motor and cognitive cost of dual-task walking depends heavily on the type and perceived complexity of the cognitive task being performed. Cognitive cost for the STR task was low irrespective of walking speed, suggesting that at preferred-speed individuals prioritize complex cognitive tasks requiring higher attentional and processing resources over walking. While performing VMRT task, individuals preferred to prioritize more complex walking task over VMRT task resulting in lesser motor cost and increased cognitive cost for VMRT task. Furthermore, slow walking can assist in diverting greater attention towards complex cognitive tasks, improving its performance while walking.

AB  - Abstract
Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) has protective effects on many neurological diseases. Here, we aimed to test G-CSF’s effects on perihematomal tissue injuries following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and examine whether the effects were functionally dependent on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and aquaporin-4 (AQP4). We detected the expression of perihematomal VEGF, VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) and AQP4 at 1, 3 and 7 days after ICH. Also, we examined the effects of G-CSF on tissue injuries by ICH in wild type mice, and tested whether such effects were VEGF and AQP4 dependent by using VEGFR inhibitor – SU5416 and AQP4 knock-out (AQP4−/−) mice. Furthermore, we assessed the related signal transduction pathways via astrocyte cultures. We found G-CSF highly increased perihematomal VEGF, VEGFR-2 and AQP4. Importantly, G-CSF led to neurological functional improvement in both types of mice by associating with reduction of brain edema, blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability and neuronal death and apoptosis and statistical analysis suggested AQP4 was required for these effects. Besides, except BBB leakage alleviation, the above effects were attenuated but not counteracted by SU5416, suggesting involvement of VEGF. G-CSF up-regulated phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as well as VEGF and AQP4 proteins in cultured astrocytes. The latter was inhibited by ERK and STAT3 inhibitors respectively. Our data suggest the protective effects of G-CSF on perihematomal tissue injuries after ICH are highly associated with the increased levels of VEGF and AQP4, possibly act through C-Jun amino-terminal kinase and ERK pathways respectively.

AB  - Abstract
Hyperactivity (increased spontaneous firing rates) following cochlear trauma and hearing loss has been well documented in the inferior colliculus (IC). This hyperactivity is associated with frequency regions in the IC that are closely related to regions of peripheral hearing loss. In other auditory nuclei, notably cochlear nucleus, hyperactivity has been shown to be more prevalent in particular cell types but this has not been investigated in the IC. Single-neuron spontaneous firing rates were recorded in the IC of animals after acoustic trauma (10-kHz tone at 124 dB for 2 h) and in sham surgery controls. Single-neuron recordings were made 2 weeks later. Evoked responses to ipsi- and contralateral sound were used for classification. Classifications were based on peri-stimulus time histograms, input–output functions, frequency response areas and monaural/binaural responses. Results showed increased spontaneous firing rates in the IC following trauma, in regions corresponding to the frequencies at which there was peripheral hearing loss (12–20 kHz). Most response categories, with the exception of cells showing an onset response classification, showed a significantly increased average spontaneous firing rate. These data suggest that hyperactivity in the IC is not confined to a particular response type in contrast to findings in the cochlear nucleus. This may be the result of factors intrinsic to the IC, or because of convergent input to the IC from a range of other auditory structures.

Orbitofrontal reality filtering denotes a memory control mechanism necessary to keep thought and behavior in phase with reality. Its failure induces reality confusion as evident in confabulation and disorientation. In the present study, we explored the influence of orbitofrontal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on reality filtering. Twenty healthy human subjects made a reality filtering task, while receiving cathodal, anodal, or sham stimulation over the frontal pole in three sessions separated by at least 1 week. Computational models predicted that this montage can produce polarity-specific current flow across the posterior medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). In agreement with our hypothesis, we found that cathodal tDCS over the frontal pole specifically impaired reality filtering in comparison to anodal and sham stimulation. This study shows that reality filtering, an orbitofrontal function, can be modulated with tDCS.

AB  - Abstract
Self-worth is particularly influenced by self-appraisal, which is negatively biased in many psychiatric disorders. Positive and negative self-appraisals also shape current emotional states or even evoke defensive reactions, when they are incongruent with a subject’s current state. Prior studies have mainly used externally given evaluative appraisals. In this study, 30 subjects used individual negative and positive self-appraisals during functional magnetic resonance imaging. We additionally investigated the effects of such self-appraisals onto the subsequent perception of photos of the individual subjects.

Both self-appraisal conditions activated dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to the neutral condition. Positive self-appraisal evoked stronger activity than negative self-appraisal in the amygdala, ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex, whereas negative self-appraisal was associated with increased activity in the occipital regions. Positive self-appraisal had no effect on the perception of a photo of oneself, whereas negative appraisal increased activity in the anterior insula and parietal regions.

Overall, positive self-appraisal activated more emotion-related brain regions, whereas negative self-appraisal had a relatively stronger influence on perception-related brain activity. These findings could on the one hand explain the effect of negative self-appraisal on the behavior in the real world and on the other hand support a stronger focus of psychotherapy on enhancing positive self-appraisals.

AB  - Abstract
Anhedonia is one of the core symptoms of depression and has been linked to blunted responses to rewarding stimuli in striatal regions. Stress, a key vulnerability factor for depression, has been shown to induce anhedonic behavior, including reduced reward responsiveness in both animals and humans, but the brain processes associated with these effects remain largely unknown in humans. Emerging evidence suggests that stress has dissociable effects on distinct components of reward processing, as it has been found to potentiate motivation/‘wanting’ during the anticipatory phase but reduce reward responsiveness/‘liking’ during the consummatory phase. To examine the impact of stress on reward processing, we used a monetary incentive delay (MID) task and an acute stress manipulation (negative performance feedback) in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Fifteen healthy participants performed the MID task under no-stress and stress conditions. We hypothesized that stress would have dissociable effects on the anticipatory and consummatory phases in reward-related brain regions. Specifically, we expected reduced striatal responsiveness during reward consumption (mirroring patterns previously observed in clinical depression) and increased striatal activation during reward anticipation consistent with non-human findings. Supporting our hypotheses, significant Phase (Anticipation/Consumption) × Stress (Stress/No-stress) interactions emerged in the putamen, nucleus accumbens, caudate and amygdala. Post hoc tests revealed that stress increased striatal and amygdalar activation during anticipation but decreased striatal activation during consumption. Importantly, stress-induced striatal blunting was similar to the profile observed in clinical depression under baseline (no-stress) conditions in prior studies. Given that stress is a pivotal vulnerability factor for depression, these results offer insight to better understand the etiology of this prevalent disorder.

Widely correlated spontaneous activity in the developing nervous system is transiently expressed and is considered to play a fundamental role in neural circuit formation. The depolarization wave, which spreads over a long distance along the neuraxis, maximally extending to the lumbosacral cord and forebrain, is an example of this spontaneous activity. Although the depolarization wave is typically initiated in the spinal cord in intact preparations, spontaneous discharges have also been detected in the isolated brainstem. Although this suggests that the brainstem has the ability to generate spontaneous activity, but is paced by a caudal rhythm generator of higher excitability, a number of questions remains. Does brainstem activity simply appear as a passive consequence, or does any active change occur in the brainstem network to compensate for this activity? If the latter is the case, does this compensation occur equally at different developmental stages? Where is the new rhythm generator in the isolated brainstem? To answer these questions, we optically analyzed spatio-temporal patterns of activity detected from the chick brainstem before and after transection at the obex. The results revealed that the depolarization wave was homeostatically maintained, which was characterized by an increase in excitability and/or the number of neurons recruited to the wave. The wave was more easily maintained in younger embryos. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the ability of brainstem neurons to perform such an active compensation was not lost even at the stage when the depolarization wave was no longer observed in the intact brainstem.

AB  - Abstract
Neuro-glucostasis is required for normal expression of the steroid positive-feedback-induced preovulatory pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, a critical element of female reproduction. Glucoprivic signals from the caudal hindbrain restrain this surge, but the cellular source of this stimulus is unclear. Norepinephrine (NE) exerts well-defined stimulatory effects on the reproductive neuroendocrine axis. Our studies show that medullary A2 noradrenergic neurons are both estrogen- and glucoprivic-sensitive. Here, we investigated the premise that the LH surge is inhibited by A2 cell reactivity to hindbrain glucopenia and diminished preoptic NE neurotransmission. Estradiol- and progesterone-primed ovariectomized (OVX) female rats were injected into the caudal fourth ventricle (CV4) with the glucose anti-metabolite, 5-thioglucose (5TG) or saline (SAL) prior to onset of the LH surge. Pretreatment by intra-CV4 delivery of the selective catecholamine neurotoxin, 6-OHDA, attenuated LH output, but prevented inhibition by 5TG. 5TG modified patterns of steroid feedback-associated Fos staining of A2, but not other medullary catecholamine cell groups. Intra-preoptic administration of the alpha1-adrenergic receptor agonist, methoxamine, elicited site-specific reversal of hindbrain glucoprivic suppression of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuron Fos labeling and LH release. Western blotting of laser-microdissected A2 neurons revealed glucoprivic stimulation of Fos, but inhibition of the catecholamine synthetic enzyme, dopamine-β-hydroxylase; 5TG also diminished A2 estrogen receptor (ER)-α and progesterone receptor profiles, but augmented ER-β protein. Intriguingly, A2 AMPK activity was decreased in 5TG-treated rats, despite down-regulation of GLUT3 and no change in MCT2 protein expression. Rostral preoptic GnRH neurons also exhibited decreased AMPK activation simultaneous with apparent reduction of neuropeptide signaling to the pituitary. The present studies demonstrate that hindbrain glucoprivation inhibits the LH surge, in part, by reducing preoptic noradrenergic input, and furthermore implicate A2 neurons as a source of this altered signal. Results also suggest that AMPK sensor deactivation does not supersede the impact of pharmacological inhibition of glucose catabolism on A2 cell function nor afferent signaling of hindbrain glucopenia on GnRH neurons. Further studies are needed to determine if decreased AMPK activation in these cell populations reflect compensatory gain in positive energy balance and/or direct effects of estrogen on AMPK.

AB  - Abstract
Prenatal exposure to ethanol has been shown to increase the risk of anxiety in offspring. Here, we tested the effect of prenatal ethanol exposure on adult male mandarin voles (Microtus mandarinus). We examined anxiety-like behavior in the open field and elevated plus-maze tests in males exposed to ethanol prenatally. One control group was not exposed to ethanol or saline, while another control group was exposed to saline. At the age of 90 days, males were tested and levels of serum testosterone, androgen receptor immunoreactive neurons (AR-IRs) and arginine vasopressin immunoreactive neurons (AVP-IRs) were measured. Animals exposed to ethanol spent less time in the center of the chamber, covered less distance and conducted fewer crossings in the open-field test. These animals also spent less time and conducted fewer crossings in the open arms. However, they spent more time and made more entries in the closed arms, and traveled less total distance during the elevated plus-maze test, compared to the control voles. Serum T was lower in the ethanol group, and the AR-IR number in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), medial preoptic area (mPOA) and medial amygdaloid nucleus (MeA) was significantly lower. The number of AVP-IRs in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the ethanol group was higher than that of the control groups. Our findings suggest that prenatal ethanol exposure may lead to reduced serum T levels, decreased AR and increased AVP in the CNS and result in the development of anxiety-like behaviors.

AB  - Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has traditionally been regarded as a disease of the gray matter (GM). However, the advent of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has contributed to new knowledge about how changes in white matter (WM) microstructure in vivo may be directly related to the pathophysiology of AD. It is now evident that WM is heavily affected in AD, even at early stages. Still, our knowledge about WM degeneration in AD is poor compared to what we know about GM atrophy. For instance, it has not been clear if WM can be directly affected in AD independently of GM degeneration, or whether WM changes mainly represent secondary effects of GM atrophy, e.g. through Wallerian degeneration. In this paper, we review recent studies using DTI to study WM alterations in AD. These studies suggest that microstructural WM affection at pre-AD stages cannot completely be accounted for by concomitant GM atrophy. Further, recent research has demonstrated relationships between increased cerebrospinal fluid levels of Tau proteins and changes in WM microstructure indexed by DTI, which could indicate that WM degeneration in pre-AD stages is related to ongoing axonal damage. We conclude that DTI is a promising biomarker for AD, with the potential also to identify subgroups of patients with especially high degree of WM affection, thereby contributing to more differentiated pre-AD diagnoses. However, more research and validation studies are needed before it is realistic to use this information in clinical practice with individual patients.

AB  - Abstract
Therapeutic options for hypoxic–ischemic brain damage (HIBD) are scarce and inefficient. Recently, many studies have demonstrated that red photon plays an important role in anti-inflammatory processes as well as apoptosis, the main trait of HIBD. In this study, we investigated whether red photon can protect from HIBD in SD rats and oxygen–glucose deprivation (OGD) in PC12 cells. Apoptosis, mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MMP), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) rates were assessed in PC12 cells. We found that 6-h irradiation resulted in decreased MMP, ROS and apoptosis rates, although these changes were reversible with prolonged irradiation. Importantly, these effects were sustained for 2–8 h upon quenching of the red photon. Similar trends were observed for protein and mRNA expression of bax and bcl-2, with short-term irradiation (6 h) inhibiting apoptosis in PC12 Cells. However, long-term (&gt;6 h) irradiation caused cell damage. In vivo experiments, bax mRNA and protein levels were reduced after 7 days in HIBD model rats treated with red photon, in contrast to bcl-2. Furthermore, we found that bax and bcl-2 were mainly expressed in pyramidal cells of the hippocampus CA1 and CA3. Importantly, Morris Water Maze test results revealed an improvement in learning ability and spatial memory in rats after irradiation. Overall, our data showed that short-term irradiation with red photon in the acute phase inhibits the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway via regulation of bcl-2-related proteins and reduction of ROS levels, thereby decreasing apoptosis in nerve cells and improving the neurological prognosis of HIBD.

AB  - Abstract
Hypoxia evokes a regulated decrease in the body core temperature (Tc) in a variety of animals. The neuronal mechanisms of this response include, at least in part, glutamatergic activation in the lateral preoptic area (LPO) of the hypothalamus. As the sympathetic premotor neurons in the medulla oblongata constitute a cardinal relay station in the descending neuronal pathway from the hypothalamus for thermoregulation, their inhibition can also be critically involved in the mechanisms of the hypoxia-induced hypothermia. Here, I examined the hypothesis that hypoxia-induced hypothermia is mediated by glutamate-responsive neurons in the LPO that activate GABAergic transmission in the rostral raphe pallidus (rRPa) and neighboring parapyramidal region (PPy) of the medulla oblongata in urethane–chloralose-anesthetized, neuromuscularly blocked, artificially ventilated rats. Unilateral microinjection of GABA (15 nmol) into the rRPa and PPy regions elicited a prompt increase in tail skin temperature (Ts) and decreases in Tc, oxygen consumption rate (VO2), and heart rate. Next, when the GABAA receptor blocker bicuculline methiodide (bicuculline methiodide (BMI), 10 pmol) alone was microinjected into the rRPa, it elicited unexpected contradictory responses: simultaneous increases in Ts, VO2 and heart rate and a decrease in Tc. Then, when BMI was microinjected bilaterally into the PPy, no direct effect on Ts was seen; and thermogenic and tachycardic responses were slight. However, pretreatment of the PPy with BMI, but not vehicle saline, greatly attenuated the hypothermic responses evoked by hypoxic (10%O2–90%N2, 5 min) ventilation or bilateral microinjections of glutamate (5 nmol, each side) into the LPO. The results suggest that hypoxia-induced hypothermia was mediated, at least in part, by the activation of GABAA receptors in the PPy.

AB  - Abstract
Neuropathologic processes such as cerebral ischemia can enhance neurogenesis. Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) emerges as a critical regulator of physiological and pathological angiogenesis during embryonic and postnatal life. Although Ang1 could protect peripheral vasculature from vascular leakage following ischemic injury, the role of Ang1 in long-term neurological recovery after ischemic stroke remains elusive. This study aims to examine whether Ang1 overexpression via lentivirus-mediated gene transfer enhances neurovascular remodeling and improves functional outcome in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia. Our results demonstrated that lentivirus-mediated Ang1 gene transfer led to improved neurological behavior and reduced infarction volume, and protected against blood–brain barrier (BBB) leakage in the ischemic rats. In addition, we revealed that these effects of Ang1 are related to the ability of Ang1 to increase vascular density and accelerate endogenous neuronal differentiation. These findings suggest that Ang1 is a promising agent for the treatment of cerebral ischemia.

AB  - Abstract
Obesity and eating disorders are prevailing health concerns worldwide. It is important to understand the regulation of food intake and energy metabolism. Thiamine (vitamin B1) is an essential nutrient. Thiamine deficiency (TD) can cause a number of disorders in humans, such as Beriberi and Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome. We demonstrated here that TD caused anorexia in C57BL/6 mice. After feeding a TD diet for 16 days, the mice displayed a significant decrease in food intake and an increase in resting energy expenditure (REE), which resulted in a severe weight loss. At the 22nd day, the food intake was reduced by 69% and 74% for male and female mice, respectively in TD group. The REE increased by ninefolds in TD group. The loss of body weight (17–24%) was similar between male and female animals and mainly resulted from the reduction of fat mass (49% decrease). Re-supplementation of thiamine (benfotiamine) restored animal’s appetite, leading to a total recovery of body weight. The hypothalamic adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a critical regulator of food intake. TD inhibited the phosphorylation of AMPK in the arcuate nucleus (ARN) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus without affecting its expression. TD-induced inhibition of AMPK phosphorylation was reversed once thiamine was re-supplemented. In contrast, TD increased AMPK phosphorylation in the skeletal muscle and upregulated the uncoupling protein (UCP)-1 in brown adipose tissues which was consistent with increased basal energy expenditure. Re-administration of thiamine stabilized AMPK phosphorylation in the skeletal muscle as well as energy expenditure. Taken together, TD may induce anorexia by inhibiting hypothalamic AMPK activity. With a simultaneous increase in energy expenditure, TD caused an overall body weight loss. The results suggest that the status of thiamine levels in the body may affect food intake and body weight.

AB  - Abstract
Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a psychiatric illness characterized by restricted eating and an intense fear of gaining weight. Most individuals with AN are females, diagnosed first during adolescence, 40–80% of whom exhibit excessive exercise, and an equally high number with a history of anxiety disorder. We sought to determine the cellular basis for individual differences in AN vulnerability by using an animal model, activity-based anorexia (ABA), that is induced by combining food restriction (FR) with access to a running wheel that allows voluntary exercise. Previously, we showed that by the fourth day of FR, the ABA group of adolescent female rats exhibit &gt;500% greater levels of non-synaptic α4βδ-GABAARs at the plasma membrane of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell spines, relative to the levels found in age-matched controls that are not FR and without wheel access. Here, we show that the ABA group exhibits individual differences in body weight loss, with some losing nearly 30%, while others lose only 15%. The individual differences in weight loss are ascribable to individual differences in wheel activity that both precedes and concurs with days of FR. Moreover, the increase in activity during FR correlates strongly and negatively with α4βδ-GABAAR levels (R = −0.9, p &lt; 0.01). This negative correlation is evident within 2 days of FR, before body weight loss approaches life-threatening levels for any individual. These findings suggest that increased shunting inhibition by α4βδ-GABAARs in spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons may participate in the protection against the ABA-inducing environmental factors of severe weight loss by suppressing excitability of the CA1 pyramidal neurons which, in turn, is related indirectly to suppression of excessive exercise. The data also indicate that, although exercise has many health benefits, it can be maladaptive to individuals with low levels of α4βδ-GABAARs in the CA1, particularly when combined with FR.

AB  - Abstract
Homer protein, a member of the post-synaptic density protein family, plays an important role in the neuronal synaptic activity and is extensively involved in neurological disorders. The present study investigates the role of Homer1b/c in modulating neuronal survival by using an in vitro traumatic neuronal injury model, which was achieved by using a punch device that consisted of 28 stainless steel blades joined together and produced 28 parallel cuts. Downregulation of Homer1b/c by specific siRNA significantly (p &lt; 0.05) alleviated the cytoplasmic calcium levels and neuron lactate dehydrogenase release, and ultimately decreased the apoptotic rate after traumatic neuronal injury compared with non-targeting siRNA control treatment in cultured rat cortical neurons. Moreover, the expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1a (mGluR1a) was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced in the Homer1b/c siRNA-transfected neurons after injury. Therefore, Homer1b/c not only modulated the mGluR1a-inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors-Ca2+ signal transduction pathway, but also regulated the expression of mGluR1a in mechanical neuronal injury. These findings indicate that the suppression of Homer1b/c expression potentially protects neurons from glutamate excitotoxicity after injury and might be an effective intervention target in traumatic brain injury.

AB  - Abstract
High molecular weight (HMW) glycosaminoglycanes of the extracellular matrix have been implicated in tissue repair. The aim of this study was to evaluate if small synthetic hyaluronan disaccharides with different degrees of sulfation (methyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(β-d-glucopyranosyluronic acid)-O-sulfo-α-d-glucopyranoside, sodium salt (di0S), methyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(β-d-glucopyranosyluronic acid)-6-di-O-sulfo-α-d-glucopyranoside, disodium salt (di6S) and methyl 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(β-d-glucopyranosyluronic acid)-4,6-di-O-sulfo-α-d-glucopyranoside, trisodium salt (di4,6S)) could improve cell survival in in vitro and in vivo brain ischemia-related models. Rat hippocampal slices subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation and a photothrombotic stroke model in mice were used. The three hyaluran disaccharides, incubated during the oxygen and glucose deprivation (15 min) and re-oxygenation periods (120 min), reduced cell death of hippocampal slices measured as 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide reduction, being the most potent di4,6S; in contrast, high molecular hyaluronan was ineffective. The protective actions of di4,6S against oxygen and glucose deprivation were related to activation of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway, reduction of p65 translocation to the nucleus, inhibition of inducible nitric oxide oxidase induction and reactive oxygen species production, and to an increase in glutathione levels. Administered 1 h post-stroke, di4,6S reduced cerebral infarct size and improved motor activity in the beam walk test. In conclusion, di4,6S affords neuroprotection in in vitro and in vivo models of ischemic neuronal damage. Our results suggest that its neuroprotective effect could be exerted through its capability to reduce oxidative stress during ischemia. Its small molecular size makes it a more potential druggable drug to target the brain as compared with its HMW parent compound hyaluronan.

AB  - Abstract
Cortical fast spiking (FS) interneurons possess autaptic, synaptic, and electrical synapses that serve to mediate a fast, coordinated response to their postsynaptic targets. While FS interneurons are known to participate in numerous and diverse actions, functional subgroupings within this multi-functional interneuron class remain to be identified. In the present study, we examined parvalbumin-positive FS interneurons in layer 4 of the primary somatosensory (barrel) cortex – a brain region well-known for specialized inhibitory function. Here we show that FS interneurons fall into two broad categories identified by the onset of the first action potential in a depolarizing train as: “delayed firing FS interneurons (FSD) and early onset firing FS interneurons (FSE). Subtle variations in action potential firing reveal six subtypes within these two categories: delayed non-accommodating (FSD-NAC), delayed stuttering (FSD-STUT), early onset stuttering (FSE-STUT), early onset-late spiking (FSE-LS), early onset early-spiking (FSE-ES), and early onset accommodating (FSE-AC). Using biophysical criteria previously employed to distinguish neuronal cell types, the FSD and FSE categories exhibit several shared biophysical and synaptic properties that coincide with the notion of specificity of inhibitory function within the cortical FS interneuron class.

AB  - Abstract
Homer is a postsynaptic density (PSD) scaffold protein that is involved in synaptic plasticity, calcium signaling and neurological disorders. Here, we use pre-embedding immunogold electron microscopy to illustrate the differential localization of three Homer gene products (Homer 1, 2, and 3) in different regions of the mouse brain. In cross-sectioned PSDs, Homer occupies a layer ∼30–100 nm from the postsynaptic membrane lying just beyond the dense material that defines the PSD core (∼30-nm-thick). Homer is evenly distributed within the PSD area along the lateral axis, but not at the peri-PSD locations within 60 nm from the edge of the PSD, where type I-metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1 and 5) are concentrated. This distribution of Homer matches that of Shank, another major PSD scaffold protein, but differs from those of other two major binding partners of Homer, type I mGluR and IP3 receptors.

Many PSD proteins rapidly redistribute upon acute (2 min) stimulation. To determine whether Homer distribution is affected by acute stimulation, we examined its distribution in dissociated hippocampal cultures under different conditions. Both the pattern and density of label for Homer 1, the isoform that is ubiquitous in hippocampus, remained unchanged under high K+ depolarization (90 mM for 2–5 min), N-methyl-d-asparic acid (NMDA) treatment (50 μM for 2 min), and calcium-free conditions (EGTA at 1 mM for 2 min). In contrast, Shank and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) accumulate at the PSD upon NMDA treatment, and CaMKII is excluded from the PSD complex under low calcium conditions.

AB  - Abstract
The pontine micturition center or Barrington’s nucleus (BN) – besides regulating micturition – co-regulates the activity of other pelvic viscera such as the colon and genitals. At present, this issue is gaining particular importance due to: (i) recent findings of α-synuclein in BN, (ii) known urinary dysfunction in parkinsonian patients (part of the so-called non-motor symptoms), other patients with dementia and as in very old individuals; and (iii) its proximity to the pedunculopontine nucleus, a surgical target in deep brain stimulation for Parkinson’s disease (PD). The structural and functional organization of the micturition reflex comprises a coordinating action of somatic motor activity with both divisions of the autonomic nervous system, modulated by trunk encephalic and cortical centers that involve the BN as locus coeruleus and periaqueductal gray matter, among other trunk encephalic structures. The involvement of dopaminergic activity (physiologic inhibition of the micturition reflex mediated by dopaminergic D1 activity) that diminishes in Parkinsonism and leads to overactivity of the micturition reflex is also well known. In this review, the integrating role of the BN in the context of vesical and gastrointestinal behavior is revisited, and the principal morpho-functional findings that associate dysfunction with the urinary disorders that appear during the pre-motor stages of PD are summarized.

Cortical spreading depression (CSD) plays an important role in migraine with aura. The caudate nucleus has crucial functional interactions with brain regions likely to be important in migraine. The aim of the present in vitro study was to investigate the effect of CSD on the neuronal activity of the caudate. Intracellular recording was performed in the head of the caudate nucleus alongside of extracellular recording in Wistar rat somatosensory cortex. CSD was induced by local KCl injection. Changes in the membrane potentials of the caudate neurons began 1.2 ± 0.2 min after CSD. The neurons of the caudate nucleus depolarized first gradually and slightly then it depolarized abruptly at nearly the same point of time of the recovery of the cortical DC potential. Action potentials (APs) reappeared after the cortical DC shift returned to the baseline. Forty-five minutes after CSD, the caudate neurons showed lower frequency of APs and larger amplitude of depolarization prior to APs. The firing pattern of the caudate neurons evoked by injection of intracellular current pulses changed from slow adapting to fast adapting after CSD. Reduced neuronal activity in the caudate after CSD may be assumed to contribute to pain as well as changes in cognition and behavior in patients with migraine.

AB  - Abstract
Impaired balance may limit mobility and daily activities, and plays a key role in the elderly falling. Maintaining balance requires a concerted action of the sensory, nervous and motor systems, whereby cause and effect mutually affect each other within a closed loop. Aforementioned systems and their connecting pathways are prone to chronological age and disease-related deterioration. System redundancy allows for compensation strategies, e.g. sensory reweighting, to maintain standing balance in spite of the deterioration of underlying systems. Once those strategies fail, impaired balance and possible falls may occur. Targeted interventions to prevent falling require knowledge of the quality of the underlying systems and the compensation strategies used. As current clinical balance tests only measure the ability to maintain standing balance and cannot distinguish between cause and effect in a closed loop, there is a clear clinical need for new techniques to assess standing balance. A way to disentangle cause-and-effect relations to identify primary defects and compensation strategies is based on the application of external disturbances and system identification techniques, applicable in clinical practice. This paper outlines the multiple deteriorations of the underlying systems that may be involved in standing balance, which have to be detected early to prevent impaired standing balance. An overview of clinically used balance tests shows that early detection of impaired standing balance and identification of causal mechanisms is difficult with current tests, thereby hindering the development of well-timed and target-oriented interventions as described next. Finally, a new approach to assess standing balance and to detect the underlying deteriorations is proposed.

It is believed that muscarinic M1/4 receptors are closely correlated to the dopaminergic system and are strongly involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). In addition to regulating lipid metabolism and protection from stroke, statins have been used to regulate the declined cognition. We aimed to explore the regional changes in M1/4 receptors in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rat brain.
Methods
PD rat model was set up by injecting 6-OHDA into the unilateral medial forebrain bundle; while simvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) or saline was orally administrated for 3 weeks, respectively. Long-term memory was measured using the Morris water maze. [3H]pirenzepine binding autoradiography was applied to investigate the alterations of M1/4 receptors in the PD rat brains.
Results
6-OHDA induced long-term memory deficits along with downregulation of M1/4 receptors in the hippocampus, the medial amygdala, the posteromedial cortical and the piriform cortex; simvastatin administration significantly ameliorated the impaired memory and reversed the downregulation of M1/4 receptors in the examined brain regions. Profound positive correlations were verified between the decline in long-term memory activity and the restoration of M1/4 receptors in different brain regions after simvastatin treatment.
Conclusions/significance
Our results provide strong evidence that M1/4 receptor modulation after simvastatin administration did, at least partially, contribute to the improvement in the long-term memory in 6-OHDA-induced PD rats. These results provide a possible mechanism for simvastatin treatment in psycho-neurological diseases such as PD via M1/4 receptors.

AB  - Abstract
Our previous study showed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced brain injury in the neonatal rat is associated with nitrosative and oxidative stress. The present study was conducted to examine whether melatonin, an endogenous molecule with antioxidant properties, reduces systemic LPS-induced nitrosative and oxidative damage in the neonatal rat brain. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of LPS (2 mg/kg) was administered to Sprague–Dawley rat pups on postnatal day 5 (P5), and i.p. administration of melatonin (20 mg/kg) or vehicle was performed 5 min after LPS injection. Sensorimotor behavioral tests were performed 24 h after LPS exposure, and brain injury was examined after these tests. The results show that systemic LPS exposure resulted in impaired sensorimotor behavioral performance, and acute brain injury, as indicated by the loss of oligodendrocyte immunoreactivity and a decrease in mitochondrial activity in the neonatal rat brain. Melatonin treatment significantly reduced LPS-induced neurobehavioral disturbances and brain damage in neonatal rats. The neuroprotective effect of melatonin was associated with attenuation of LPS-induced nitrosative and oxidative stress, as indicated by the decreased nitrotyrosine- and 4-hydroxynonenal-positive staining in the brain following melatonin and LPS exposure in neonatal rats. Further, melatonin significantly attenuated LPS-induced increases in the number of activated microglia in the neonatal rat brain. The protection provided by melatonin was also associated with a reduced number of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)+ cells, which were double-labeled with ED1 (microglia). Our results show that melatonin prevents the brain injury and neurobehavioral disturbances induced by systemic LPS exposure in neonatal rats, and its neuroprotective effects are associated with its impact on nitrosative and oxidative stress.

AB  - Abstract
GABA is a predominant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS. Released GABA is removed from the synaptic cleft by two GABA transporters (GATs), GAT-1 and GAT-3, and their dysfunction affects brain functions. The present study aimed to reveal the ontogeny of the GABA-removal system by examining the immunohistochemical localization of GAT-1 and GAT-3 in the embryonic and postnatal mouse cervical spinal cord. In the dorsal horn, GAT-1 was localized within the presynapses of inhibitory axons after embryonic day 15 (E15), a little prior to GABAergic synapse formation. The GAT-1-positive dots increased in density until postnatal day 21 (P21). By contrast, in the ventral horn, GAT-1-positive dots were sparse during development, although many transient GABAergic synapses were formed before birth. GAT-3 was first localized within the radial processes of radial glia in the ventral part on E12 and the dorsal part on E15. The initial localization of the GAT-3 was almost concomitant with the dispersal of GABAergic neurons. GAT-3 continued to be localized within the processes of astrocytes, and increased in expression until P21. These results suggested the following: (1) before synapse formation, GABA may be transported into the processes of radial glia or immature astrocytes by GAT-3. (2) At the transient GABAergic synapses in the ventral horn, GABA may not be reuptaken into the presynapses. (3) In the dorsal horn, GABA may start to be reuptaken by GAT-1 a little prior to synapse formation. (4) After synapse formation, GAT-3 may continue to remove GABA from immature and mature synaptic clefts into the processes of astrocytes. (5) Development of the GABA-removal system may be completed by P21.

AB  - Abstract
Synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP25), vesicle-associated membrane protein 1 (VAMP1) and 2 (VAMP2) are components of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion attachment protein receptors (SNARE) complex which is involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, a fundamental step in neurotransmitter release.

SNARE expression in cerebellum correlates with specific neurotransmitter pathways underlying synaptic diversification and defined synaptic properties.

In this study we firstly characterized the distribution of SNAP25, VAMP1 and VAMP2 in the nerve terminals of a defined cerebellar region, the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN), of adult and newborn rats. Then, given the pivotal role of estradiol (E2) in the synaptic organization of the cerebellar circuitry in early postnatal life, we examined whether administration of E2 in the newborn DCN affected synaptic density and changed the distribution of the presynaptic proteins SNAP25, VAMP1 and VAMP2, together with post synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95).

Results showed that: (1) distribution of SNAP25, VAMP1 and VAMP2 in adult DCN differs significantly from that found in newborn DCN; (2) administration of E2 in the newborn DCN affected synaptic density and also changed the distribution of the pre- and postsynaptic proteins.

The differential distribution of SNAP25, VAMP1 and VAMP2 in nerve terminals of adult and newborn rats may correlate with specific stages of neuronal phenotypic differentiation. The effects of E2 on SNAP25, VAMP1, VAMP2, PDS95 and synaptic density suggest that pre- and postsynaptic proteins are under estrogenic control during development and that synaptic maturation can also be related with the activity of this steroid.

AB  - Abstract
Excitatory responses evoked by N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) in the vestibular nuclei (VN) of the rat were studied in vivo during microiontophoretic application of noradrenaline (NA) and/or its agonists and antagonists. Ejection of NA-modified excitatory responses mediated by NMDA receptors (NMDAR) in all neurons tested; the effect was enhancement in 59% of cases and depression in the remaining 41%. Enhancements prevailed in all VN with the exception of the lateral vestibular nucleus, where both effects were recorded in an equal number of cases.

The enhancing action of NA on NMDAR-mediated responses was mimicked by the noradrenergic beta-receptor agonist isoproterenol, the beta1 specific agonist denopamine and the alpha2 agonist clonidine. These effects were blocked respectively by the generic beta-receptor antagonist timolol, the beta1 antagonist atenolol and the alpha2 antagonist yohimbine. In contrast, application of the alpha1 receptor agonist cirazoline and the specific alpha1 antagonist prazosin respectively mimicked and partially antagonized the depression of NMDAR-mediated excitations induced by NA.

Double-labeling immunohistochemical techniques demonstrated broad colocalization of NMDAR (specifically NR1 and NR2 subunits) with noradrenergic receptors (alpha1, alpha2 and beta1) in many VN neurons; only minor differences were found between nuclei.

These results indicate that NA can produce generalized modulation of NMDAR-mediated excitatory neurotransmission in VN, which may in turn modify synaptic plasticity within the nuclei.

AB  - Abstract
There are two ways to picture white matter: as a grid of electrical wires or a network of roads. The first metaphor captures the classical function of an axon as conductor of action potentials (and information) from one brain region to another. The second one points to the important role of axons in a bi-directional transport of biological molecules and organelles between the cell body and synapse. Given the wide variety of such cargoes, a well-functioning axonal transport is critical for a number of processes, including neurotransmission, metabolism and viability of neurons. This selective review will emphasize the need for considering axonal transport when interpreting functional consequences of inter-individual variations in the structural properties of white matter. We start by describing the space occupied by white matter and techniques used in vivo for its characterization. We then provide examples of key features of maturation and aging of white matter, as well as some of the common abnormalities observed in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Next, we review work that motivated our focus on axonal diameter, and explain the relationships between transport and cytoskeleton within the axon. We will conclude by describing molecular machinery of axonal transport and genes that may contribute to inter-individual variations in axonal diameter and axonal transport.

AB  - Abstract
Working memory (WM) tasks may increase or decrease the interference effect of concurrently performed cognitive control tasks. However, the neural oscillatory correlates of this modulation effect of WM on the Stroop task are still largely unknown. In the present study, behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) data were recorded from 32 healthy participants during their performance of the single Stroop task and the same task with a concurrent WM task. We observed that the Stroop interference effect represented in both response times (RTs) and theta-band event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) magnitude reduced under the dual-task condition compared with the single-task condition. The reduction of interference in theta-band ERSP was further positively correlated with interference reduction in RTs, and was mainly explained by the source in the left middle frontal gyrus. In conclusion, the present study suggests that the effect of concurrent WM tasks on the reduction of the Stroop interference effect can be indexed by EEG oscillations in theta-band rhythm in the centro-frontal regions and this modulation was mediated by the reduced cognitive control under the concurrent WM task.

AB  - Abstract
Rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD) present an exaggerated endocrine response to stress conditions, which, like obesity, show a high correlation with cardiovascular diseases. Meanwhile the GABAergic neurotransmission within the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) is involved in the regulation of the physiological responses during emotional stress. Here we evaluated the influence of obesity, induced by a HFD, on the cardiovascular responses induced by air jet stress in rats, and the role of the GABAergic tonus within the DMH in these changes. Our results showed that consumption of a HFD (45% w/w fat) for 9 weeks induced obesity and increases in baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR). Moreover, obesity potentiated stress responsiveness, evidenced by the greater changes in MAP and HR induced by stress in obese rats. The injection of muscimol into the DMH reduced the maximal increases in HR and MAP induced by stress in both groups; however, the reduction in the maximal increases in MAP in the HFD group was less pronounced. Moreover, the injection of muscimol into the DMH of obese rats was less effective in reducing the stress-induced tachycardia, since the HR attained the same levels at the end of the stress paradigm as after the vehicle injection. Injection of bicuculline into DMH induced increases in MAP and HR in both groups. Nevertheless, obesity shortened the tachycardic response to bicuculline injection. These data show that obesity potentiates the cardiovascular response to stress in rats due to an inefficient GABAA-mediated inhibition within the DMH.

AB  - Abstract
Polyglutamine expansions in some proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington’s disease or several ataxias, lead to insoluble aggregates in the cell. These aggregates accumulate through a mechanism that is not yet fully understood, but it activates cell death pathways and contributes to kill the cell. Here, we show that apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf1) down-regulation, or treatment with pharmacological Apaf1 inhibitor SVT016426, decreases both polyglutamine-induced aggregation and polyglutamine-induced apoptotic cell death in different cellular models. We demonstrate that Apaf1 binds to both Htt and to heat shock protein chaperone Hsp70, and that this interaction is altered in the presence of the pharmacological inhibitor of Apaf1. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that Apaf1 enhances polyglutamine aggregation by reducing the cellular protein levels of available functional Hsp70.

AB  - Abstract
Chemical and electrical stimulation of the inferior colliculus (IC) causes defensive behavior. Electrical stimulation of the IC at the escape threshold enhances dopamine (DA) release in the prefrontal cortex. Intra-ventral tegmental area injections of quinpirole at doses that act presynaptically reduce the release of DA in the terminal fields of the mesolimbic system and clearly reduce conditioned fear in several animal models of anxiety. However, little is known about the involvement of DA in the mediation of unconditioned fear, such as the reactivity to acute stressors. The present study investigated the neural substrates mediated by DA transmission associated with emotional changes triggered by the activation or inhibition of D2 receptors during conditioned and unconditioned fear. We examined the effects of systemic or local injections of the DA-receptor antagonist and agonist haloperidol and quinpirole, respectively, into the IC in rats subjected to fear-potentiated startle, a Pavlovian paradigm that uses loud sounds as the unconditioned stimulus and light previously paired with footshock as the conditioned stimulus. We also assessed auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) recorded from electrodes implanted in the IC. Intraperitoneal haloperidol administration dose-dependently enhanced AEPs induced by loud tones and inhibited fear-potentiated startle. Intra-IC injections of quinpirole left AEPs unchanged, suggesting that an optimal level of postsynaptic D2 receptors in the IC may regulate the transmission of aversive information through the midbrain tectum. These findings provide evidence of opposing DA-mediated mechanisms in fear/anxiety processes that depend on the area under study. The activity of the neural substrates of conditioned fear was attenuated by haloperidol, whereas midbrain neural substrates of unconditioned fear were enhanced. Thus, DA appears to regulate unconditioned fear at the midbrain level, likely by reducing the sensory gating of aversive events and reducing conditioned fear by acting at more rostral levels of the brain.

AB  - AbstractObjective
Women are more prone to major depressive disorders (MDDs) and the incidence of MDD in women is almost twice that of men. Insular cortex abnormalities are a common finding in neuroanatomical studies of patients with MDD. However, it remains largely unclear whether female MDD patients at different clinical stages show morphologic changes in a specific subregion of the insular cortex. Additionally, it is not understood if any subregion changes can be used as a state or trait marker of MDD, and whether the diagnostic performance of any marker is sufficient to identify MDD.
Methods
Nineteen right-handed current MDD (cMDD) female patients and 19 remitted MDD (rMDD) patients, as well as 19 healthy controls matched for age and educational level, were recruited into the study. By means of voxel-based morphometry (VBM), we investigated gray matter volume abnormalities in insular subregions among the three groups and further conducted region-of-interest (ROI)-based receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. The data from these investigations were correlated with clinical data to confirm the effectiveness of the identified changes in the subregions in differentiating the three groups.
Results
Both the cMDD and rMDD groups showed significantly decreased gray matter volumes in the left dorsal anterior insula compared to the healthy controls. The cMDD groups also showed decreased gray matter volumes in the right dorsal anterior insula relative to healthy controls. Further ROC comparisons demonstrated that the left dorsal anterior insula can effectively differentiate cMDD and rMDD groups from healthy controls.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that the volume changes in the left dorsal anterior insular cortex may be a trait-related marker of vulnerability to MDD and that the right dorsal anterior insular cortex may involve pathological changes of MDD.

AB  - Abstract
The KCNJ10 gene which encodes an inwardly rectifying K+ channel Kir4.1 subunit plays an essential role in the inner ear and hearing. Mutations or deficiency of KCNJ10 can cause hearing loss with EAST or SeSAME syndromes. This review mainly focuses on the expression and function of Kir4.1 potassium channels in the inner ear and hearing. We first introduce general information about inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels. Then, we review the expression and function of Kir4.1 channels in the inner ear, especially in endocochlear potential (EP) generation. Finally, we review KCNJ10 mutation-induced hearing loss and functional impairments. Kir4.1 is strongly expressed on the apical membrane of intermediate cells in the stria vascularis and in the satellite cells of cochlear ganglia. Functionally, Kir4.1 has critical roles in cochlear development and hearing through two distinct aspects of extracellular K+ homeostasis: First, it participates in the generation and maintenance of EP and high K+ concentration in the endolymph inside the scala media. Second, Kir4.1 is the major K+ channel in satellite glial cells surrounding spiral ganglion neurons to sink K+ ions expelled by the ganglion neurons during excitation. Kir4.1 deficiency leads to hearing loss with the absence of EP and spiral ganglion neuron degeneration. Deafness mutants show loss-of-function and reduced channel membrane-targeting and currents, which can be rescued upon by co-expression with wild-type Kir4.1. This review provides insights for further understanding Kir potassium channel function in the inner ear and the pathogenesis of deafness due to KCNJ10 deficiency, and also provides insights for developing therapeutic strategies targeting this deafness.

AB  - Abstract
Modifications of histone deacetylases (HDACs) may be involved in microglia-driven neuroinflammatory responses. Recent studies suggest that several inflammatory molecules can regulate the extent of neurodegeneration and regeneration in the central nervous system (CNS). In the present study, we investigated the effects of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) valproic acid (VPA) and sodium butyrate (NaBut) on the release of prostaglandins (PGs) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated microglia. We found that VPA and NaBut significantly enhanced LPS-induced release of PGE2, PGD2 and 8-iso-PGF2α. In addition, both compounds increased cyclooxygenase-2 and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase immunoreactivity and gene expression in LPS-stimulated microglia. Interestingly, treatment of activated microglia with HDACi also enhanced the gene expression and the release of different pro-inflammatory cytokines. Microglia activation with LPS leads to IκB-α degradation, as well as p38, ERK1/2 and JNK MAPKs phosphorylation and thus activation, which is not affected by treatment with VPA and NaBut. Furthermore, VPA and NaBut treatment induced histone acetylation at H3-K18 in microglia. We suggest that VPA and NaBut-driven increase in PGs release in LPS-activated microglia might be regulated at the transcriptional level and involves histone hyperacetylation. Our data demonstrate that VPA and NaBut are able to modulate microglia responses to inflammatory insults and thus possibly can regulate the CNS degenerative and regenerative processes.

AB  - Abstract
Vibrissal whisking is often employed to track facial nerve regeneration in rats; however, we have observed similar degrees of whisking recovery after facial nerve transection with or without repair. We hypothesized that the source of non-facial nerve-mediated whisker movement after chronic denervation was from autonomic, cholinergic axons traveling within the infraorbital branch of the trigeminal nerve (ION). Rats underwent unilateral facial nerve transection with repair (N = 7) or resection without repair (N = 11). Post-operative whisking amplitude was measured weekly across 10 weeks, and during intraoperative stimulation of the ION and facial nerves at ⩾18 weeks. Whisking was also measured after subsequent ION transection (N = 6) or pharmacologic blocking of the autonomic ganglia using hexamethonium (N = 3), and after snout cooling intended to elicit a vasodilation reflex (N = 3). Whisking recovered more quickly and with greater amplitude in rats that underwent facial nerve repair compared to resection (P &lt; 0.05), but individual rats overlapped in whisking amplitude across both groups. In the resected rats, non-facial-nerve-mediated whisking was elicited by electrical stimulation of the ION, temporarily diminished following hexamethonium injection, abolished by transection of the ION, and rapidly and significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased by snout cooling. Moreover, fibrillation-related whisker movements decreased in all rats during the initial recovery period (indicative of reinnervation), but re-appeared in the resected rats after undergoing ION transection (indicative of motor denervation). Cholinergic, parasympathetic axons traveling within the ION innervate whisker pad vasculature, and immunohistochemistry for vasoactive intestinal peptide revealed these axons branching extensively over whisker pad muscles and contacting neuromuscular junctions after facial nerve resection. This study provides the first behavioral and anatomical evidence of spontaneous autonomic innervation of skeletal muscle after motor nerve lesion, which not only has implications for interpreting facial nerve reinnervation results, but also calls into question whether autonomic-mediated innervation of striated muscle occurs naturally in other forms of neuropathy.

AB  - Abstract
Sensorineural hearing losses (SNHLs; e.g., ototoxicant- and noise-induced hearing loss or presbycusis) are among the most frequent sensory deficits, but they lack effective drug therapies. The majority of recent therapeutic approaches focused on the trials of antioxidants and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers in SNHLs. The rationale for these studies was the prominent role of disturbed redox homeostasis and the consequent ROS elevation. Although the antioxidant therapies in several animal studies seemed to be promising, clinical trials have failed to fulfill expectations.

We investigated the potential of rasagiline, an FDA-approved monomanine oxidase type B inhibitor (MAO-B) inhibitor type anti-parkinsonian drug, as an otoprotectant. We showed a dose-dependent alleviation of the kanamycin-induced threshold shifts measured by auditory brainstem response (ABR) in an ototoxicant aminoglycoside antibiotic-based hearing loss model in mice. This effect proved to be statistically significant at a 6-mg/kg (s.c.) dose. The most prominent effect appeared at 16 kHz, which is the hearing sensitivity optimum for mice. The neuroprotective, antiapoptotic and antioxidant effects of rasagiline in animal models, all targeting a specific mechanism of aminoglycoside injury, may explain this otoprotection.

The dopaminergic neurotransmission enhancer effect of rasagiline might also contribute to the protection. Dopamine (DA), released from lateral olivocochlear (LOC) fibers, was shown to exert a protective action against excitotoxicity, a pathological factor in the aminoglycoside-induced SNHL. We have shown that rasagiline enhanced the electric stimulation-evoked release of DA from an acute mouse cochlea preparation in a dose-dependent manner. Using inhibitors of voltage-gated Na+-, Ca2+ channels and DA transporters, we revealed that rasagiline potentiated the action potential-evoked release of DA by inhibiting the reuptake.

The complex, multifactorial pathomechanism of SNHLs most likely requires drugs acting on multiple targets for effective therapy. Rasagiline, with its multi-target action and favorable adverse effects profile, might be a good candidate for a clinical trial testing the otoprotective indication.

AB  - Abstract
Epilepsy is a debilitating disease affecting 1–2% of the world’s population. Despite this high prevalence, 30% of patients suffering from epilepsy are not successfully managed by current medication suggesting a critical need for new anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). In an effort to discover new therapeutics for the management of epilepsy, we began our study by screening drugs that, like some currently used AEDs, inhibit histone deacetylases (HDACs) using a well-established larval zebrafish model. In this model, 7-day post fertilization (dpf) larvae are treated with the widely used seizure-inducing compound pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) which stimulates a rapid increase in swimming behavior previously determined to be a measurable manifestation of seizures. In our first screen, we tested a number of different HDAC inhibitors and found that one, 2-benzamido-1 4-naphthoquinone (NQN1), significantly decreased swim activity to levels equal to that of valproic acid, 2-n-propylpentanoic acid (VPA). We continued to screen structurally related compounds including Vitamin K3 (VK3) and a number of novel Vitamin K (VK) analogs. We found that VK3 was a robust inhibitor of the PTZ-induced swim activity, as were several of our novel compounds. Three of these compounds were subsequently tested on mouse seizure models at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Anticonvulsant Screening Program. Compound 2h reduced seizures particularly well in the minimal clonic seizure (6 Hz) and corneal-kindled mouse models of epilepsy, with no observable toxicity. As VK3 affects mitochondrial function, we tested the effects of our compounds on mitochondrial respiration and ATP production in a mouse hippocampal cell line. We demonstrate that these compounds affect ATP metabolism and increase total cellular ATP. Our data indicate the potential utility of these and other VK analogs for the prevention of seizures and suggest the potential mechanism for this protection may lie in the ability of these compounds to affect energy production.

AB  - Abstract
Social isolation during the vulnerable period of adolescence produces emotional dysregulation manifested by abnormalities in adult behaviors that require emotional processing. The affected brain regions may include the basolateral amygdala (BLA), where plasticity of glutamatergic synapses in principal neurons plays a role in conditioned emotional responses. This plasticity is dependent on NMDA receptor trafficking denoted by intracellular mobilization of the obligatory NR1 NMDA subunit. We tested the hypothesis that the psychosocial stress of adolescent social isolation (ASI) produces a lasting change in NMDA receptor distribution in principal neurons in the BLA of adults that express maladaptive emotional responses to sensory cues. For this, we used behavioral testing and dual electron microscopic immunolabeling of NR1 and calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a protein predominantly expressed in principal neurons of the BLA in adult C57Bl/6 mice housed in isolation or in social groups from post-weaning day 22 until adulthood (∼3 months of age). The isolates showed persistent deficits in sensorimotor gating evidenced by altered prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle and hyperlocomotor activity in a novel environment. Immunogold-silver labeling for NR1 alone or together with CaMKII was seen in many somatodendritic profiles in the BLA of all mice irrespective of rearing conditions. However, isolates compared with group-reared mice had a significantly lower cytoplasmic (4.72 ± 0.517 vs 6.31 ± 0.517) and higher plasmalemmal (0.397 ± 0.0779 vs 0.216 ± 0.026) density of NR1 immunogold particles in CaMKII-containing dendritic spines. There was no rearing-dependent difference in the size or number of these spines or those of other dendritic profiles within the neuropil, which also failed to show an impact of ASI on NR1 immunogold labeling. These results provide the first evidence that ASI enhances the surface trafficking of NMDA receptors in dendritic spines of principal neurons in the BLA of adult mice showing maladaptive behaviors that are consistent with emotional dysregulation.

AB  - Abstract
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) exert its biological functions by interacting with membrane bound receptors. However, functions of BMPs are also regulated in the extracellular space by secreted antagonistic regulators. Chordin is an extracellular BMP antagonist that binds BMP-2, 4, and 7 with high affinity and thus interferes with binding to BMP receptors. Although chordin expression has been well described in the early development of the CNS, little information is available for its expression in the adult CNS. We, thus, investigated chordin expression in the adult rat CNS using immunohistochemistry. Chordin was intensely expressed in most neurons, and their dendrites and axons. In addition, abundant chordin expression was also observed in the neuropil of the gray matters where high plasticity is reported, such as the molecular layer of the cerebellum and the superficial layer of the superior colliculus. Furthermore, we found that astrocytes and ependymal cells also express chordin protein. These data indicate that chordin is more widely expressed throughout the adult CNS than previously reported, and its continued abundant expression in the adult brain strongly supports the idea that chordin plays pivotal roles also in the adult brain.

AB  - Abstract
A fundamental role of the taste system is to discriminate between nutritive and toxic foods. However, it is unknown whether bacterial pathogens that might contaminate food and water modulate the transmission of taste input to the brain. We hypothesized that exogenous, bacterially-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS), modulates neural responses to taste stimuli. Neurophysiological responses from the chorda tympani nerve, which innervates taste cells on the anterior tongue, were unchanged by acute exposure to LPS. Instead, neural responses to sucrose were selectively inhibited in mice that drank LPS during a single overnight period. Decreased sucrose sensitivity appeared 7 days after LPS ingestion, in parallel with decreased lingual expression of Tas1r2 and Tas1r3 transcripts, which are translated to T1R2 + T1R3 subunits forming the sweet taste receptor. Tas1r2 and Tas1r3 mRNA expression levels and neural responses to sucrose were restored by 14 days after LPS consumption. Ingestion of LPS, rather than contact with taste receptor cells, appears to be necessary to suppress sucrose responses. Furthermore, mice lacking the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 for LPS were resistant to neurophysiological changes following LPS consumption. These findings demonstrate that ingestion of LPS during a single period specifically and transiently inhibits neural responses to sucrose. We suggest that LPS drinking initiates TLR4-dependent hormonal signals that downregulate sweet taste receptor genes in taste buds. Delayed inhibition of sweet taste signaling may influence food selection and the complex interplay between gastrointestinal bacteria and obesity.

AB  - Abstract
Rodents exhibit leptin resistance and high levels of prolactin/placental lactogens during pregnancy. A crosstalk between prolactin and leptin signaling has been proposed as a possible mechanism to explain the changes in energy balance during gestation. However, it remains unclear if specific neuronal populations co-express leptin and prolactin receptors. Therefore, our present study was undertaken to identify in the mouse brain prolactin-responsive cells that possibly express the leptin receptor (LepR). In addition, we assessed the leptin response in different brain nuclei of pregnant and nulliparous mice. We used a LepR-reporter mouse to visualize LepR-expressing cells with the tdTomato fluorescent protein. Prolactin-responsive cells were visualized with the immunohistochemical detection of the phosphorylated form of the signal transducer and activator of transcription-5 (pSTAT5-ir). Notably, many neurons that co-expressed tdTomato and pSTAT5-ir were observed in the medial preoptic area (MPA, 27–48% of tdTomato cells), the retrochiasmatic area (34–51%) and the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS, 16–24%) of prolactin-treated nulliparous mice, pregnant mice and prolactin-treated leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice. The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (8–22%), the medial tuberal nucleus (11–15%) and the ventral premammillary nucleus (4–10%) showed smaller percentages of double-labeled cells among the groups. Other brain nuclei did not show significant percentages of neurons that co-expressed tdTomato and pSTAT5-ir. Late pregnant mice exhibited a reduced leptin response in the MPA and NTS when compared with nulliparous mice; however, a normal leptin response was observed in other brain nuclei. In conclusion, our findings shed light on how the brain integrates the information conveyed by leptin and prolactin. Our results corroborate the hypothesis that high levels of prolactin or placental lactogens during pregnancy may directly interfere with LepR signaling, possibly predisposing to leptin resistance.

Motor execution and imagery (ME and MI), as the basic abilities of human beings, have been considered to be effective strategies in motor skill learning and motor abilities rehabilitation. Neuroimaging studies have revealed several critical regions from functional activation for ME as well as MI. Recently, investigations have probed into functional connectivity of ME; however, few explorations compared the functional connectivity between the two tasks. With betweenness centrality (BC) of graph theory, we explored and compared the functional connectivity between two finger tapping tasks of ME and MI. Our results showed that using BC, the key node for the ME task mainly focused on the supplementary motor area, while the key node for the MI task mainly located in the right premotor area. These results characterized the connectivity patterns of ME and MI and may provide new insights into the neural mechanism underlying motor execution and imagination of movements.

The amino acid taurine is required for development and functioning of the central and peripheral nervous system where it exerts osmoregulatory, neuromodulatory and anti-apoptotic actions. It is subject to cellular import by the taurine transporter slc6a6. Absence of the transporter and consequently, absence of taurine leads to several neurologic deficits and sensory losses. In a slc6a6 knock-out mouse model, consequences of congenital taurine deficiency were assessed in nociceptive sensory processes. The formalin assay, hot plate assay, and summated generator potentials in response to local nociceptive stimulation with gaseous CO2 were applied. Reduced responsiveness of slc6a6(−/−) mice to nociceptive stimulation was observed in particular to chemical nociceptive stimuli. Scl6a6 knock-out mice spent significantly less time licking the formalin injected paw and displayed smaller amplitudes of the nociceptive nasal mucosa potentials than wild-type mice (p = 0.002 and 0.01 respectively). In contrast, withdrawal latencies on a hot plate did not significantly differ, suggesting that intracellular taurine deficits lead in particular to a hyposensitivity of nociceptive sensory neurons sensitive to noxious chemical stimulation. As hereditary absence of taurine affects biological processes of anatomical structure development, the altered nociceptive responses likely reflect consequences of compromised peripheral nervous system development.

AB  - Abstract
Prolactin (PRL) has many functions in the CNS, including neuroprotection. During lactation, the dorsal hippocampus is protected from excitotoxic kainic acid (KA)-induced cellular damage. We have previously reported that systemic pre-treatment with ovine PRL had similar protective effects in female rats. Here, we asked (1) whether intracerebral human PRL (hPRL) would have the same action, (2) because phosphorylated PRL is high in lactation, whether a mimic of phosphorylated hPRL, human prolactin in which the normally phosphorylated serine at position 179 is replaced with an aspartate (S179D-PRL), had similar activity, and (3) what signaling pathways mediated the protective effect. Female ovariectomized (OVX, 1 month) rats were implanted with micro-osmotic pumps connected to unilateral icv cannulae directed at the right lateral ventricle. The pumps delivered 0.10 ng/h of hPRL, S179D-PRL, a combination of hPRL+S179D-PRL, or saline vehicle for 7 days prior to a systemic dose of 7.5 mg/kg of KA. Rats were sacrificed 48 h after KA injection. Immunostaining for neuronal nuclei (Neu-N) revealed a significant KA-induced decrease in cell number in the CA1, CA3, and CA4 hippocampal areas of rats (∼55% of control). Treatment with either hPRL or S179D-PRL or the combination prevented the damaging effect of KA in these hippocampal regions (∼95% of corresponding control), but was not completely effective at preventing early seizure-related behaviors such as staring and wet dog shakes. Analysis of signals generated by hPRL and S179D-PRL showed no activation of signal transducer and activation of transcription 5 (Stat5) or other signaling molecules in the hippocampus, but activation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 in the amygdala. These results support a central protective effect of both PRL forms and suggest that PRL could be exerting its protective action by indirectly modulating input signals to the hippocampus and thus regulating excitability.

AB  - Abstract
Illicit use of prescription opioid analgesics (e.g., oxycodone) in adolescence is a pressing public health issue. Our goal was to determine whether oxycodone self administration differentially affects striatal neurotransmitter receptor gene expression in the dorsal striatum of adolescent compared to adult C57BL/6J mice. Groups of adolescent mice (4 weeks old, n = 12) and of adult mice (11 weeks old, n = 11) underwent surgery during which a catheter was implanted into their jugular veins. After recovering from surgery, mice self administered oxycodone (0.25 mg/kg/infusion) 2 h/day for 14 consecutive days or served as yoked saline controls. Mice were sacrificed within 1 h after the last self-administration session and the dorsal striatum was isolated for mRNA analysis. Gene expression was analyzed with real time PCR using a commercially available neurotransmitter receptor PCR array containing 84 genes. We found that adolescent mice self administered less oxycodone than adult mice over the 14 days. Monoamine oxidase A (Maoa) and neuropeptide Y receptor 5 mRNA levels were lower in adolescent mice than in adult mice without oxycodone exposure. Oxycodone self administration increased Maoa mRNA levels compared to controls in both age groups. There was a positive correlation of the amount of oxycodone self administered in the last session or across 14 sessions with Maoa mRNA levels. Gastrin-releasing peptide receptor mRNA showed a significant Drug × Age interaction, with point-wise significance. More genes in the dorsal striatum of adolescents (19) changed in response to oxycodone self administration compared to controls than in adult (4) mice. Overall, this study demonstrates that repeated oxycodone self administration alters neurotransmitter receptors gene expression in the dorsal striatum of adolescent and adult mice.

AB  - Abstract
Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor gene that regulates various cell processes including proliferation, growth, synaptogenesis, neural and glioma stem/progenitor cell renewal. In addition, PTEN can regulate sensory cell proliferation and differentiation of hair bundles in the mammalian cochlea. In this study we use immunofluorescence, Western blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to reveal the expression of PTEN in the developing cochlear lateral wall, which is crucial for regulating K+ homeostasis. Relatively high levels of PTEN are initially expressed in the marginal cells (MCs) of the lateral wall at embryonic day (E) 17.5 when they start to differentiate. Similarly high levels are subsequently expressed in differentiating root cells (RCs) at postnatal day (P) 3 and then in spiral ligament fibrocytes (SLFs) at P 10. In the mature cochlea, PTEN expression is low or undetectable in MCs and SLFs but it remains high in RCs and their processes. The expression pattern for PTEN in the developing lateral wall suggests that it plays a critical role in the differentiation of the cellular pathways that regulate K+ homeostasis in the cochlea.

AB  - Abstract
This study examined the proposed automatic and involuntary nature of synesthetic experiences in grapheme-color synesthetes by comparing behavioral and blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses in a synesthetic and a standard version of the Stroop task. Clear interference effects in terms of slower reaction times and stronger BOLD responses in the rostral cingulate zone (RCZ) were found in synesthetes performing the synesthetic version of the Stroop task. Surprisingly, less interference was found in synesthetes compared with controls performing the standard Stroop task. This smaller interference effect, expressed as the difference in reaction time between incongruent and neutral stimuli, was explained in terms of experienced interference during the neutral condition of the Stroop task in synesthetes. This was confirmed by stronger BOLD responses in the RCZ for synesthetes specifically in the neutral condition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show different performance of synesthetes in a standard Stroop task and the presented data can be seen as strong evidence for the automatic and involuntary nature of synesthetic experiences.

AB  - Abstract
The cytokine erythropoietin (Epo) initiates adaptive cellular responses to both moderate environmental challenges and tissue damaging insults in various non-hematopoietic mammalian tissues including the nervous system. Neuroprotective and neuroregenerative functions of Epo in mammals are mediated through receptor-associated Janus kinase 2 and intracellular signaling cascades that modify the transcription of Epo-regulated genes. Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) and phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) represent key components of two important Epo-induced transduction pathways.

Our previous study on insects revealed neuroprotective and regenerative functions of recombinant human Epo (rhEpo) similar to those in mammalian nervous tissues. Here we demonstrate that rhEpo effectively rescues primary cultured locust brain neurons from apoptotic cell death induced by hypoxia or the chemical compound H-7. The Janus kinase inhibitor AG-490 and the STAT inhibitor sc-355797 abolished protective effects of rhEpo on locust brain neurons. In contrast, inhibition of PI3K with LY294002 had no effect on rhEpo-mediated neuroprotection. The results indicate that rhEpo mediates the protection of locust brain neurons through interference with apoptotic pathways by the activation of a Janus kinase-associated receptor and STAT transcription factor(s). The involvement of similar transduction pathways in mammals and insects for the mediation of neuroprotection and support of neural regeneration by Epo indicates that an Epo/Epo receptor-like signaling system with high structural and functional similarity exists in both groups of animals. Epo-like signaling involved in tissue protection appears to be an ancient beneficial function shared by vertebrates and invertebrates.

AB  - Abstract
Neuromedin U (NMU) is a highly conserved neuropeptide which regulates food intake and body weight. Transgenic mice lacking NMU are hyperphagic and obese, making NMU a novel target for understanding and treating obesity. Neuromedin U receptor 2 (NMUR2) is a high-affinity receptor for NMU found in discrete regions of the central nervous system, in particular the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), where it may be responsible for mediating the anorectic effects of NMU. We hypothesized that selective knock down of NMUR2 in the PVN of rats would increase their sensitivity to the reinforcing properties of food resulting in increased intake and preference for high-fat obesogenic food. To this end, we used viral-mediated RNAi to selectively knock down NMUR2 gene expression in the PVN. In rats fed a standard chow, NMUR2 knockdown produced no significant effect on food intake or body weight. However, when the same rats were fed a high-fat diet (45% fat), they consumed significantly more food, gained more body weight, and had increased feed efficiency relative to controls. Furthermore, NMUR2 knockdown rats demonstrated significantly greater binge-type food consumption of the high-fat diet and showed a greater preference for higher-fat food. These results demonstrate that NMUR2 signaling in the PVN regulates consumption and preference for high-fat foods without disrupting feeding behavior associated with non-obesogenic standard chow.

AB  - Abstract
Death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) has been found promoting cell death under stress conditions, including cell death during brain ischemia. However, little is known about the mechanisms how DAPK is involved in the neuronal death-promoting process during ischemia. The present study was to examine the DAPK signal transduction pathways using an ischemia mimicking model, oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). OGD was induced by incubating SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells in glucose-free culture medium flushed with a mixture of N2 and CO2. DAPK expression was inhibited by transfection of SH-SY5Y cells with DAPK short hairpin RNA (shRNA). Cell death induced by OGD exposure was assessed by Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) assay. Protein expressions were examined by Western blot and protein interactions were detected with immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot. OGD treatment resulted in neuronal death and led to DAPK activation as demonstrated by increase of DAPK (active form) and decrease of phospho-DAPK (inactive form). The activation of DAPK in turn led to BimEL up-regulation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress activation. Further analyses showed that DAPK mediated BimEL expression through extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) inactivation and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase1/2 (JNK1/2) activation. These findings revealed novel signal transduction pathways leading to neuronal death in response to OGD.

AB  - Abstract
Levo-tetrahydropalmatine (l-THP) is an alkaloid purified from corydalis and has been used in many traditional Chinese herbal preparations for its analgesic, sedative, and hypnotic properties. Previous studies indicated that l-THP has modest antagonist activity against dopamine receptors and thus it might have potential therapeutic effects on drug addiction. However, whether and how l-THP contributes to methamphetamine (METH)-induced locomotor sensitization remains unclear. Therefore, the current study aims to examine the roles of l-THP in the development and expression of METH-induced locomotor sensitization as well as the accompanying extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), caudate putamen (CPu) and prefrontal cortex (PFc) in mice. We found that moderate doses of METH (0.5 and 2 mg/kg) induced hyper-locomotor activity in mice on all METH injection days whereas high dose of METH (5 mg/kg)-treated mice displayed only acute locomotor response to METH and severe stereotyped behaviors on the first day after drug injection. Interestingly, only 2 mg/kg dose of METH-induced locomotor sensitization which was accompanied by the activation of ERK1/2 in the NAc and CPu in mice. Although l-THP (5 and 10 mg/kg) per se did not induce obvious changes in locomotor activities in mice, its co-administration with METH could significantly attenuate acute METH-induced hyper-locomotor activity, the development and expression of METH-induced locomotor sensitization, and the accompanying ERK1/2 activation in the NAc and CPu. These results suggest that l-THP has potential therapeutic effect on METH-induced locomotor sensitization, and the underlying molecular mechanism might be related to its inhibitory effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the NAc and CPu.

AB  - Abstract
The majority of work examining the nucleus accumbens core (NAc) has focused on functions pertaining to behaviors guided by appetitive outcomes. These studies have pointed to the NAc as being critical for motivating behavior toward desirable outcomes. For example, we have recently shown that lesions of the NAc impaired performance on a reward-guided decision-making task that required rats to choose between differently valued rewards. Unfortunately, much less is known about the role that the NAc plays in motivating behavior when aversive outcomes are predicted. To address this issue we asked if NAc lesions impact performance on a two-way active avoidance task in which rats must learn to shuttle back and forth in a behavioral training box in order to avoid a footshock predicted by an auditory tone. Although bilateral NAc lesions initially impaired reward-guided decision-making, we found that the same lesions improved acquisition and retention of two-way active avoidance.

AB  - Abstract
Oligodendrocytes and the myelin they produce are a remarkable vertebrate specialization that enables rapid and efficient nerve conduction within the central nervous system. The generation of myelin during development involves a finely-tuned pathway of oligodendrocyte precursor specification, proliferation and migration followed by differentiation and the subsequent myelination of appropriate axons. In this review we summarize the molecular mechanisms known to regulate each of these processes, including the extracellular ligands that promote or inhibit development of the oligodendrocyte lineage, the intracellular pathways they signal through and the key transcription factors that mediate their effects. Many of these regulatory mechanisms have recurring roles in regulating several transitions during oligodendrocyte development, highlighting their importance. It is also highly likely that many of these developmental mechanisms will also be involved in myelin repair in human neurological disease.

AB  - Abstract
We have developed a classifier capable of locating and identifying speech sounds using activity from rat auditory cortex with an accuracy equivalent to behavioral performance and without the need to specify the onset time of the speech sounds. This classifier can identify speech sounds from a large speech set within 40 ms of stimulus presentation. To compare the temporal limits of the classifier to behavior, we developed a novel task that requires rats to identify individual consonant sounds from a stream of distracter consonants. The classifier successfully predicted the ability of rats to accurately identify speech sounds for syllable presentation rates up to 10 syllables per second (up to 17.9 ± 1.5 bits/s), which is comparable to human performance. Our results demonstrate that the spatiotemporal patterns generated in primary auditory cortex can be used to quickly and accurately identify consonant sounds from a continuous speech stream without prior knowledge of the stimulus onset times. Improved understanding of the neural mechanisms that support robust speech processing in difficult listening conditions could improve the identification and treatment of a variety of speech-processing disorders.

AB  - Abstract
The chromogranin A-derived peptide catestatin (CST) exerts sympathoexcitatory and hypertensive effects when microinjected into the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM: excitatory output); it exhibits sympathoinhibitory and antihypertensive effects when microinjected into the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM: inhibitory output) of vagotomized normotensive rats. Here, continuous infusion of CST into the central amygdalar nucleus (CeA) of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) for 15 days resulted in a marked decrease of blood pressure (BP) in 6-month- (by 37 mmHg) and 9-month- (by 65 mmHg)old rats. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings on pyramidal CeA neurons revealed that CST increased both spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) amplitude plus frequency, along with reductions of sIPSC rise time and decay time. Inhibition of GABAA receptors (GABAARs) by bicuculline completely abolished CST-induced sIPSC, corroborating that CST signals occur through this major neuroreceptor complex. Hypertension is a major risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases, leading to vascular dementia and neurodegeneration. We found a marked neurodegeneration in the amygdala and brainstem of 9-month-old SHRs, while CST and the GABAAR agonist Muscimol provided significant neuroprotection. Enhanced phosphorylation of Akt and ERK accounted for these neuroprotective effects through anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities. Overall our results point to CST exerting potent antihypertensive and neuroprotective effects plausibly via a GABAergic output, which constitute a novel therapeutic measure to correct defects in blood flow control in disorders such as stroke and Alzheimer’s disease.

Rapid remodeling of neurons provides the brain with flexibility to adjust to environmental fluctuations. In Siberian hamsters, hippocampal dendritic morphology fluctuates across the day. To reveal the regulatory mechanism of diurnal remodeling of hippocampal neurons, we investigated the effects of light signals applied under different photoperiodic conditions on dendritic morphology. A 4-h dark pulse during the morning of long days (LD) increased basilar dendritic length, as well as complexity of basilar dendrites of neurons in the CA1. A light pulse during the late night in short days (SD) reduced basilar dendrite branching and increased primary apical dendrites of CA1 neurons. Spine density of dentate gyrus (DG) dendrites was increased by a dark pulse in LD and spine density of CA1 basilar dendrites was decreased by a light pulse in SD. These results indicate that light signals induce rapid remodeling of dendritic morphology in a hippocampal subregion-specific manner. A light pulse in SD decreased hippocampal expression of fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk1), a receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), raising the possibility that VEGF–FLK1 signaling might be involved in the rapid decrease of branching or spine density of CA1 basilar dendrites by light.

AB  - Abstract
Caffeine is the psychostimulant most consumed worldwide but concerns arise about the growing intake of caffeine-containing drinks by adolescents since the effects of caffeine on cognitive functions and neurochemical aspects of late brain maturation during adolescence are poorly known. We now studied the behavioral impact in adolescent male rats of regular caffeine intake at low (0.1 mg/mL), moderate (0.3 mg/mL) and moderate/high (1.0 mg/mL) doses only during their active period (from 7:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M.). All tested doses of caffeine were devoid of effects on locomotor activity, but triggered anxiogenic effects. Caffeine (0.3 and 1 mg/mL) improved the performance in the object recognition task, but the higher dose of caffeine (1.0 mg/mL) decreased the habituation to an open-field arena, suggesting impaired non-associative memory. All tested doses of caffeine decreased the density of glial fibrillary acidic protein and synaptosomal-associated protein-25, but failed to modify neuron-specific nuclear protein immunoreactivity in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Caffeine (0.3–1 mg/mL) increased the density of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and proBDNF density as well as adenosine A1 receptor density in the hippocampus, whereas the higher dose of caffeine (1 mg/mL) increased the density of proBDNF and BDNF and decreased A1 receptor density in the cerebral cortex. These findings document an impact of caffeine consumption in adolescent rats with a dual impact on anxiety and recognition memory, associated with changes in BDNF levels and decreases of astrocytic and nerve terminal markers without overt neuronal damage in hippocampal and cortical regions.

AB  - Abstract
Although intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) increases the level of glutamate in the perihematomal area and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) in the ICH acute phase, it is unclear whether elevated glutamate activates neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the ICH brain and whether nNOS is an important target for ICH treatment. Here, we assessed the role of the nNOS inhibitor S-methyl-l-thiocitrulline (SMTC) in the activity of NADPH-d and ICH-induced brain injuries. An autologous blood intracerebral infusion model in male rats was used. All of the rats were sacrificed 24 h after ICH. ICH increased NADPH-d activity in the striatum. Administering SMTC 3 h after ICH decreased the activity of NADH-d (p &lt; 0.05 vs. the ICH group). The activation of gelatinolytic enzymes in the perihematomal region of the striatum was reduced by SMTC treatment (p &lt; 0.01, vs. the ICH group). The loss of laminin- and occludin-stained vessels was significant in perihematomal regions after 24 h of ICH and was significantly attenuated by the administration of SMTC (p &lt; 0.01 for laminin, p &lt; 0.05 for occluding, compared with the ICH group). Neuronal death and neurological deficits after ICH were also decreased in SMTC treatment rats (p &lt; 0.01, vs. the ICH group). The results suggest that the administration of the nNOS inhibitor SMTC after ICH protects against ICH-induced brain injuries and improves neurological function.

AB  - Abstract
In this transcranial magnetic stimulation study, we assessed motor cortex excitability in the resting hemisphere while the homologous side was active during a voluntary unimanual task. Data acquired from left- and right-handers showed that cortical excitability varied as a function of isometric task demands and hand dominance. In particular, facilitation of the motor-evoked potentials was observed across task requirements in left-handers, independent of which hemisphere was active. In right-handers, facilitation was present when the right hemisphere was active whereas this effect was largely reduced when the left hemisphere was active, suggesting pronounced inhibitory interactions from the left (dominant) to the right (non-dominant) hemisphere. The distinct scaling of motor cortex excitability indicates the importance of the left hemisphere in guiding manual control in right-handers whereas both hemispheres are functionally relevant in left-handers. Overall, the results underline the asymmetrical organization of the motor system in right-handers with an important role of the dominant hemisphere whereas symmetrical functional abilities of both hemispheres characterize left-handers.

AB  - Abstract
The goal of this study was to compare insulin resistance in aging and aging-related neurodegenerative diseases, and to determine the relationship between insulin resistance and gray matter volume (GMV) in each cohort using an unbiased, voxel-based approach. Insulin resistance was estimated in apparently healthy elderly control (HC, n = 21) and neurodegenerative disease (Alzheimer’s disease (AD), n = 20; Parkinson’s disease (PD), n = 22) groups using Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance 2 (HOMA2) and intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT). HOMA2 and GMV were assessed within groups through General Linear Model multiple regression. We found that HOMA2 was increased in both AD and PD compared to the HC group (HC vs. AD, p = 0.002, HC vs. PD, p = 0.003), although only AD subjects exhibited increased fasting glucose (p = 0.005). Furthermore, our voxel-based morphometry analysis revealed that HOMA2 was related to GMV in all cohorts in a region-specific manner (p &lt; 0.001, uncorrected). Significant relationships were observed in the medial prefrontal cortex (HC), medial temporal regions (AD), and parietal regions (PD). Finally, the directionality of the relationship between HOMA2 and GMV was disease-specific. Both HC and AD subjects exhibited negative relationships between HOMA2 and brain volume (increased HOMA2 associated with decreased brain volume), while a positive relationship was observed in PD. This cross-sectional study suggests that insulin resistance is increased in neurodegenerative disease, and that individuals with AD appear to have more severe metabolic dysfunction than individuals with PD or PD dementia.

Deficient reelin signaling leads to characteristic layering malformations in the cerebral cortex and causes polarity defects of cortical neurons. Since the discovery of reelin much has been learned about the molecular mechanisms that underlie the characteristic defects of layering defects in the reeler mutant. More recent studies provided insights in the crosstalk between reelin signaling and molecular pathways that control polarity development of radially migrating neurons. The present review summarizes and discusses recent findings on the role of reelin in modulating polarization and process orientation of neurons in the neocortex and hippocampus.

AB  - Abstract
Intramuscular injection of nerve growth factor (NGF) in healthy humans mimics some of the symptoms of myofascial temporomandibular disorders (M-TMD). We hypothesized that NGF induces a prolonged myofascial mechanical sensitization by increasing peripheral N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor expression, leading to an enhanced response of muscle nociceptors to endogenous glutamate. Behavioral experiments with an injection of NGF (25 μg/ml, 10 μl) into the masseter muscle reduced the mechanical withdrawal threshold for 1 day in male rats and 5 days in female rats. These results mirror the sex-related differences found in NGF-induced mechanical sensitization in humans. Intramuscular injection with the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist dl-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV, 0.020 g/ml, 10 μl) reversed the mechanical sensitization in male but not in female rats. NGF increased the number of NMDA receptor subtype 2B (NR2B)-expressing rat trigeminal masseter ganglion neurons in both sexes, which peaked at 3 days post injection. There was an association between the levels of NR2B expression and NGF-induced mechanical sensitization. The average soma size of NR2B-expressing neurons increased significantly. Increased expression of neuropeptides (CGRP and SP) was observed in NR2B-expressing masseter ganglion neurons in female but not in male rats. In healthy men and women, comparable basal expression levels of NR2B and SP were found in peripheral fibers from masseter muscle microbiopsies. This study suggests that NGF-induced sensitization of masseter nociceptors is mediated, in part, by enhanced peripheral NMDA receptor expression. Measurement of peripheral NMDA receptor expression may be useful as a biomarker for M-TMD pain.

AB  - Abstract
Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) exerts neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects on neurons and GDNF plays a significant role in maintenance of the dopamine neurons utilizing grafting to create a nigrostriatal microcircuit of Gdnf knockout (Gdnf−/−) tissue. To further evaluate the role of GDNF on organization of the nigrostriatal system, single or double grafts of ventral mesencephalon (VM) and lateral ganglionic eminence (LGE) with mismatches in Gdnf genotypes were performed. The survival of single grafts was monitored utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cell survival and graft organization were evaluated with immunohistochemistry. The results revealed that the size of VM single grafts did not change over time independent of genotype, while the size of the LGE transplants was significantly reduced already at 2 weeks postgrafting when lacking GDNF. Lack of GDNF did not significantly affect the survival of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in single VM grafts. However, the survival of TH-positive neurons was significantly reduced in VM derived from Gdnf+/+ when co-grafted with LGE from the Gdnf−/− tissue. In contrast, lack of GDNF in the VM portion of co-grafts had no effect on the survival of TH-positive neurons when co-grafted with LGE from Gdnf+/+ mice. The TH-positive innervation of co-grafts was sparse when the striatal co-grafts were derived from the Gdnf−/− tissue while dense and patchy when innervating LGE producing GDNF. The TH-positive innervation overlapped with the organization of dopamine and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein-relative molecular mass 32,000 (DARPP-32)-positive neurons, that was disorganized in LGE lacking GDNF production. In conclusion, GDNF is important for a proper striatal organization and for survival of TH-positive neurons in the presence of the striatal tissue.

AB  - Abstract
Prenatal glucocorticoids (GCs) are routinely used for pregnant women in preterm labor to prevent respiratory distress syndrome and intraventricular hemorrhage in premature infants. However, the effect of antenatal GCs on neurogenesis in preterm neonates remains elusive. Herein, we hypothesized that prenatal GCs might suppress both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurogenesis in preterm rabbits and that this treatment would induce distinct changes in the expression of transcription factors regulating these developmental events. To test our hypotheses, we treated pregnant rabbits with betamethasone at E27 and E28, delivered the pups at E29 (term = 32 d), and assessed neurogenesis at birth and postnatal day 3. We quantified radial glia (Sox2+) and intermediate progenitor cells (Tbr2+) in the dorsal cortical subventricular zone to assess glutamatergic neuronal progenitors, and counted Nkx2.1+ and Dlx2+ cells in the ganglionic eminence to evaluate GABAergic neurogenesis. In addition, we assayed transcription factors regulating neurogenesis. We found that prenatal GCs did not affect the densities of radial glia and intermediate progenitors of glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons. The number of GABA+ interneurons in the ganglionic eminence was similar between the prenatal GC-treated pups compared to untreated controls. Moreover, the mRNA expression of transcription factors, including Pax6, Ngn1/2, Emx1/2, Insm1, Dlx1, Nkx2.1, and Gsh2, were comparable between the two groups. However, there was a transient elevation in Mash1 protein in betamethasone-treated pups relative to controls at birth. These data suggest that prenatal GC treatment does not significantly impact the balance of glutamatergic and GABAergic neurogenesis in premature infants.

This review covers the intrinsic organization and afferent and efferent connections of the midbrain dopaminergic complex, comprising the substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area and retrorubral field, which house, respectively, the A9, A10 and A8 groups of nigrostriatal, mesolimbic and mesocortical dopaminergic neurons. In addition, A10dc (dorsal, caudal) and A10rv (rostroventral) extensions into, respectively, the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray and supramammillary nucleus are discussed. Associated intrinsic and extrinsic connections of the midbrain dopaminergic complex that utilize gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate and neuropeptides and various co-expressed combinations of these compounds are considered in conjunction with the dopamine-containing systems. A framework is provided for understanding the organization of massive afferent systems descending and ascending to the midbrain dopaminergic complex from the telencephalon and brainstem, respectively. Within the context of this framework, the basal ganglia direct and indirect output pathways are treated in some detail. Findings from rodent brain are briefly compared with those from primates, including humans. Recent literature is emphasized, including traditional experimental neuroanatomical and modern gene transfer and optogenetic studies. An attempt was made to provide sufficient background and cite a representative sampling of earlier primary papers and reviews so that people new to the field may find this to be a relatively comprehensive treatment of the subject.

AB  - Abstract
We have shown that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) contains anti-Aβ autoantibodies and IVIG could induce beta amyloid (Aβ) efflux from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to blood in both Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. However, the molecular mechanism underlying IVIG-induced Aβ efflux remains unclear. In this study, we used amyloid precursor protein (AβPP) transgenic mice to investigate if the IVIG could induce efflux of Aβ from the brain and whether low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1), a hypothetic Aβ transporter in blood–CSF barrier (BCB); could mediate this clearance process. We currently provide strong evidence to demonstrate that IVIG could reduce brain Aβ levels by pulling Aβ into the blood system in AβPP transgenic mice. In the mechanistic study, IVIG could induce Aβ efflux through the in vitro BCB membrane formed by cultured BCB epithelial cells. Both receptor-associated protein (RAP; a functional inhibitor of LRP1), and LRP1 siRNA were able to significantly inhibit the Aβ efflux. Should Aβ prove to be the underlying cause of AD, our results strongly suggest that IVIG could be beneficial in the therapy for AD by inducing efflux of Aβ from the brain through the LRP1 in the BCB.

AB  - Abstract
Maternal obesity and overconsumption of saturated fats during pregnancy have profound effects on offspring health, ranging from metabolic to behavioral disorders in later life. The influence of high-fat diet (HFD) exposure on the development of brain regions implicated in anxiety behavior is not well understood. We previously found that maternal HFD exposure is associated with an increase in anxiety behavior and alterations in the expression of several genes involved in inflammation via the glucocorticoid signaling pathway in adult rat offspring. During adolescence, the maturation of feedback systems mediating corticosteroid sensitivity is incomplete, and therefore distinct from adulthood. In this study, we examined the influence of maternal HFD on several measures of anxiety behavior and gene expression in adolescent offspring. We examined the expression of corticosteroid receptors and related inflammatory processes, as corticosteroid receptors are known to regulate circulating corticosterone levels during basal and stress conditions in addition to influencing inflammatory processes in the hippocampus and amygdala. We found that adolescent animals perinatally exposed to HFD generally showed decreased anxiety behavior accompanied by a selective alteration in the expression of the glucocorticoid receptor and several downstream inflammatory genes in the hippocampus and amygdala. These data suggest that adolescence constitutes an additional period when the effects of developmental programming may modify mental health trajectories.

AB  - Abstract
Neuroglobin (NGB), a protein highly expressed in the retina, has been shown to be up-regulated to protect neurons from hypoxic and ischemic injuries. It exhibits neuroprotective functions and plays an important role in the survival of neurons. Recent studies show that light-emitting diode (LED) white light emitted significant amounts of blue light (short-wavelength), which may be harmful to retinal cells, but the studies about biomarkers for evaluating the damage from LED white light are still insufficient. In our study, we found that NGB levels in the retina showed a twofold increase and peaked at 1 h after a 1-h exposure to blue light (453 nm) which did not cause damage to the retina. However, retinal damage was observed after 2 h of blue-light irradiation, which induced an approximate sevenfold increase of NGB levels as confirmed by Western blot and RT-PCR analysis. Immunofluorescence study demonstrated that NGB was predominantly up-regulated in the ganglion cell layer (GCL), plexiform layer (PL) and photoreceptor layer (PRL). We also examined Ngb mRNA and protein expression in the damaged retina induced by light of other wavelengths given equal photon fluxes. The LED red light (625 nm), green light (527 nm) and blue light (453 nm) increased the expression of NGB and caused TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling-positive cells, especially in the blue-light group. In addition, a negative correlation between NGB and rhodopsin was observed. These findings suggested that there was a correlation between NGB expression and the severity of the retinal damage, indicating NGB’s potential function as a biological marker of retinal damage induced by LED light.

The N2 subcomponents of event-related potentials are known to reflect early attentional processes. The anterior N2 may reflect conflict monitoring, whereas the posterior N2 may be involved in target detection. The aim of this study was to identify the brain areas involved in the generation of the N2 subcomponents, in order to define the spatiotemporal dynamics of these attentional processes. We recorded 128-channel electroencephalograms in 15 healthy controls performing a three-stimulus visual oddball task and identified standard-, distracter- and target-elicited N2 components. Individual N2 sources were localized using standardized-weighted-low-resolution-electromagnetic-tomography (swLORETA). Comparative analyses were performed with a non-parametric permutation technique. Common N2 generators were observed in the Brodmann area (BA) 24 of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The posterior cingulate cortex and the central precuneus were more involved in distracter processing, whereas the anterior precuneus and BA 32 of the ACC were target-specific. In accordance with previous demonstration of the frontoparietal cortex’s critical role in attentional processes, these new data shed light on the ACC’s role in conflict monitoring and its interaction with other median and frontoparietal structures in early attentional processes.

Necker cube is one of the ambiguous figures that is physically a static image but can be alternately perceived in two different perspectives. A great deal of debate exists regarding ambiguous figures that induce spontaneous switching between rival percepts. To investigate the time course of neural processes underlying such perceptual rivalry, we recorded electroencephalograms associated with participants’ perceptions of a Necker cube under ambiguous and unambiguous conditions, using a modified discontinuous-presentation method. Each condition consisted of two stimuli presented consecutively, starting with an unambiguous stimulus in both conditions. The second stimulus was either ambiguous (ambiguous condition) or unambiguous (control condition). We compared endogenous reversal activity of ambiguous stimuli with exogenous reversals. As a result, we found that the right-occipital beta-band activity (16–26 Hz) increased 100–150 ms and 350–450 ms after the onset of the ambiguous stimulus only when the perception of the ambiguous stimulus differed from that of the first stimulus. These results indicate that activity in the right-occipital total beta band reflects endogenous switching between rivaling percepts.

AB  - Abstract
Deep-brain stimulation at high frequencies (HFS) directed to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is used increasingly to treat patients with Parkinson’s disease. However, the mechanism of action by which HFS of the STN achieves its therapeutic effects remains unresolved. Insofar as lesions of the STN have similar therapeutic benefit, a favored hypothesis is that HFS acts by suppressing neural activity in the STN. The purpose of the present study was to exploit prior observations that exposure to ether anesthesia in a rodent model evokes c-fos expression (a marker of neural activation) in the STN and its efferent structures, the globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus and substantia nigra. We showed first that exposure to ether induced a profound oscillatory pattern of neural activity in the STN and SNr, which could explain the marked induction of c-fos immunoreactivity in these structures. Secondly, inhibition of the STN by local injections of the GABA agonist, muscimol, suppressed ether-evoked c-fos expression in all target structures. This showed that excitation of target structures in the ether model originated, at least in part, from the STN. Thirdly, and contrary to expectation, HFS of the STN increased further the expression of c-fos in the STN target structures of animals treated with ether. Finally, we demonstrated, in the absence of ether treatment, that HFS and chemical stimulation of the STN with local injections of kainic acid both induced c-fos expression in the globus pallidus, entopeduncular nucleus and substantia nigra. Together these results suggest that the principal action of STN stimulation at high frequencies is to excite rather than inhibit its efferent targets. Given that Parkinsonism has been associated with increased levels of inhibitory output activity from the basal ganglia, it is unlikely that excitation of output structures revealed in this study provides a basis for deep-brain stimulation’s therapeutic action.

AB  - Abstract
Previous studies on the neural basis of insight reflected weak consistency except for the anterior cingulate cortex. The present work adopted the semantic and homophonic punny riddle to explore the uniformity and nonuniformity of neural activities correlated to different insight problem solving. Results showed that in the early period of insight solving, the semantic and homophonic punny riddles induced a common N350-500 over the central scalp. However, during −400 to 0 ms before the riddles were solved, the semantic punny riddles induced a positive event-related potential (ERP) deflection over the temporal cortex for retrieving the extensive semantic information, while the homophonic punny riddles induced a positive ERP deflection over the temporal cortex and a negative one in the left frontal cortex which might reflect the semantic and phonological information processing respectively. Our study indicated that different insight problem solving should have the same cognitive process of detecting cognitive conflicts, but have different ways to solve the conflicts.

AB  - Abstract
Perinatal asphyxia and hypoxia are common causes of morbidity in neonates. Prenatal birth associated with hypoxemia often results in several disorders because of the lack of oxygen in the brain. Survival rates from perinatal hypoxia have improved, but appropriate treatments for recovery are still limited, with great impact on patients, their families, society in general and health systems. The aim of this work is to contribute to a better understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying the brainstem responses to hypoxia. For this purpose, distributions of two proteins, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) were analyzed in brainstems of 11 children, four of them showing neuropathological evidence of brain hypoxia. They were included in control or hypoxic groups, and then in several subgroups according to their age. Immunohistochemical labeling for these proteins revealed only cell bodies containing HIF-1α, and both cell bodies and fibers positive for MAP-2 in the children’s brainstems. The distribution of HIF-1α was more restricted than that of MAP-2, and it can be suggested that the expression of HIF-1α increased with age. The distribution pattern of MAP-2 in the medulla oblongata could be more due to age-related changes than to a response to hypoxic damage, whereas in the pons several regions, such as the nucleus ambiguus or the solitary nucleus, showed different immunolabeling patterns in controls and hypoxic cases. The distribution patterns of these two proteins suggest that some brainstem regions, such as the reticular formation or the central gray, could be less affected by conditions of hypoxia.

AB  - Abstract
Eugenol and carvacrol from clove and oregano, respectively, are agonists of the warmth-sensitive transient receptor potential channel TRPV3 and the irritant-sensitive transient receptor potential ankyrin (TRPA)-1. Eugenol and carvacrol induce oral irritation that rapidly desensitizes, accompanied by brief enhancement of innocuous warmth and heat pain in humans. We presently investigated if eugenol and carvacrol activate nociceptive primary afferent and higher order trigeminal neurons and enhance their heat-evoked responses, using calcium imaging of cultured trigeminal ganglion (TG) and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, and in vivo single-unit recordings in trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc) of rats. Eugenol and carvacrol activated 20–30% of TG and 7–20% of DRG cells, the majority of which additionally responded to menthol, mustard oil and/or capsaicin. TG cell responses to innocuous (39°) and noxious (42 °C) heating were enhanced by eugenol and carvacrol. We identified dorsomedial Vc neurons responsive to noxious heating of the tongue in pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. Eugenol and carvacrol dose-dependently elicited desensitizing responses in 55% and 73% of heat-sensitive units, respectively. Responses to noxious heat were briefly enhanced by eugenol and carvacrol. Many eugenol- and carvacrol-responsive units also responded to menthol, cinnamaldehyde and capsaicin. These data support a peripheral site for eugenol and carvacrol to enhance warmth- and noxious heat-evoked responses of trigeminal neurons, and are consistent with the observation that these agonists briefly enhance warmth and heat pain on the human tongue.

AB  - Abstract
Lateral hypothalamic (LH) stimulation produces antinociception in female rats in acute, nociceptive pain. Whether this effect occurs in neuropathic pain or whether male–female sex differences exist is unknown. We examined the effect of LH stimulation in male and female rats using conditions of nociceptive and neuropathic pain. Neuropathic groups received chronic constriction injury (CCI) to induce thermal hyperalgesia, a sign of neuropathic pain. Nociceptive rats were naive for CCI, but received the same thermal stimulus following LH stimulation. To demonstrate that CCI ligation produced thermal hyperalgesia, males and females received either ligation or sham surgery for control. Both males and females demonstrated significant thermal hyperalgesia following CCI ligation (p &lt; 0.05), but male sham surgery rats also showed a significant left–right difference not present in female sham rats. In the second experiment, rats randomly assigned to CCI or nociceptive groups were given one of three doses of the cholinergic agonist carbachol (125, 250, or 500 nmol) or normal saline for control, microinjected into the left LH. Paw withdrawal from a thermal stimulus (paw withdrawal latency; PWL) was measured every 5 min for 45 min. Linear mixed models analysis showed that males and females in both pain conditions demonstrated significant antinociception, with the 500-nmol dose producing the greatest effect across groups compared with controls for the left paw (p &lt; 0.05). Female CCI rats showed equivalent responses to the three doses, while male CCI rats showed more variability for dose. However, nociceptive females responded only to the 500-nmol dose, while nociceptive males responded to all doses (p &lt; 0.05). For right PWL, only nociceptive males showed a significant carbachol dose response. These findings are suggestive that LH stimulation produces antinociception in male and female rats in both nociceptive and neuropathic pain, but dose response differences exist based on sex and pain condition.

AB  - Abstract
Brain activities in response to acupuncture have been investigated in multiple studies; however, the neuromechanisms of low- and high-frequency transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation (TEAS) analgesia are unclear. This work aimed to investigate how brain activity and the analgesic effect changed across 30-min low- versus high-frequency TEAS. Forty-six subjects received a 30-min 2, 100-Hz TEAS or mock TEAS (MTEAS) treatment on both behavior test and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan days. On the behavior test day, the pain thresholds and pain-related negative emotional feeling ratings were tested five times – at 4.5 min before treatment, at 10, 20, and 30 min during treatment and 4.5 min after the treatment. On the fMRI scan day, to match the time-points in the behavioral testing session, the cerebral blood flow (CBF) signals were collected and incorporated with five independent runs before, during and after the treatment, each lasting 4.5 min. The analgesic effect was observed in both the TEAS groups; the analgesic affect was not found in the MTEAS group. The effect started at 20 min during the treatment and was maintained until the after-treatment states. In both TEAS groups, the regional CBF revealed a trend of early activation with later inhibition; also, a positive correlation between analgesia and the regional CBF change was observed in the anterior insula in the early stage, whereas a negative relationship was found in the parahippocampal gyrus in the later stage. The TEAS analgesia was specifically associated with the default mode network and other cortical regions in the 2-Hz TEAS group, ventral striatum and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in the 100-Hz TEAS group, respectively. These findings suggest that the mechanisms of low- and high-frequency TEAS analgesia are distinct and partially overlapped, and they verify the treatment time as a notable factor for acupuncture studies.

AB  - Abstract
Blast-induced tinnitus, along with associated auditory impairment and traumatic brain injury, is a primary concern facing military service members. To search for treatment, we investigated the therapeutic effects of sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor, given its vasodilatory effects and evidence suggesting its beneficial effects on noise-induced hearing loss. Rats were subjected to three consecutive blast exposures at 22 psi and were monitored for tinnitus using a gap-detection acoustic startle reflex paradigm. Hearing thresholds and detection were tested using auditory brainstem responses and prepulse inhibition, respectively. Blasted rats were either treated with sildenafil or tap water following blast exposure, while age-matched sham control rats were treated with sildenafil and no blast exposure. Our results showed that sildenafil did not effectively prevent acute tinnitus onset and hearing impairment. Instead, sildenafil significantly suppressed high-frequency tinnitus from 3 to 6 weeks after blast exposure and reduced hearing impairment during the first week after blast exposure. Complex results were observed in the startle force data, where sildenafil-treated rats displayed significantly reduced startle force compared to the untreated blasted group, suggesting possible mitigation of traumatic brain injury and suppression of hyperacusis-like percepts. Taken together, sildenafil showed a therapeutic effect on blast-induced tinnitus and audiological impairment in a time-dependent manner. Other regimens such as higher dosage prior to blast exposure and combination with other treatments deserve further investigation to optimize the therapeutic effects.

AB  - Abstract
This study investigated a possible role for a toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated PTEN/PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway in neuroinflammation in rat hippocampal neurons. Cultured neurons were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a TLR4 ligand, or pre-treated with TLR4 antibodies to block TLR4 signaling. Neurons were also treated with dipotassium bisperoxo (pyridine-2-carboxyl) oxovanadate [bpV(pic)] and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), selective inhibitors of PTEN and NF-κB, respectively, in the presence of LPS. The levels of PTEN, AKT, and their phosphorylated forms were evaluated, along with the nuclear localization of NF-κB, to assess pathway activation. The induction of a neuroinflammatory response was determined by measuring TNF-α and IL-1β mRNA and protein levels. The results indicated that while LPS stimulation had no effect on PTEN and AKT expression, the levels of phosphorylated PTEN (pPTEN) decreased, while phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) levels increased. Moreover, LPS treatment induced the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, and increased the expression and secretion of TNF-α and IL-1β. Blocking TLR4 increased the levels of pPTEN and decreased the levels of pAKT, while pre-treatment with bpV(pic) led to a reduction in levels of pPTEN and pAKT. Furthermore, treatment with TLR4 antibody, bpV(pic), and PDTC decreased LPS-induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB, and resulted in a downregulation of TNF-α and IL-1β expression. Taken together, these results provide evidence for a TLR4-mediated PTEN/PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway in rat hippocampal neurons, which is associated with the activation of a neuroinflammatory response.

AB  - Abstract
Wistar of the National Institute of Nutrition obese (WNIN/Ob) is a unique rat strain isolated and established at NIN, Hyderabad, India, in 1996, from its existing stock of Wistar rat colony (WNIN). This animal model exhibits all traits of metabolic syndrome and has a remarkably reduced lifespan (1.5 years as compared to 3 years in parental WNIN rats), albeit, the factors associated with premature aging are not well understood. Considering that oxidative stress and DNA damage are crucial players associated with senescence, we analyzed oxidative stress markers like lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation; DNA damage in terms of both single-stranded and double-stranded breaks and the activity of antioxidant enzymes: superoxide dismutase and catalase in brain regions of these animals. Our study revealed that the magnitude of oxidative stress and DNA damage in the neocortex and hippocampus of 3-month-old WNIN/Ob obese rats is as high as that seen in 15-month-old parental WNIN control rats. Concurrently, the antioxidant enzyme activity was significantly decreased. From these results, it can be concluded that increased oxidative stress-induced damage of macromolecules, probably due to reduced activity of antioxidant enzymes, is associated with premature aging in WNIN/Ob obese rats.

AB  - Abstract
The rapid release of prepared movements by a loud acoustic stimulus capable of eliciting a startle response has been termed the StartReact effect (Valls-Solé et al., 1999), and premotor reaction times (PMTs) of &lt;70 ms are often observed. Two explanations have been given for these short latency responses. The subcortical storage and triggering hypothesis suggests movements that can be prepared in advance of a “go” signal are stored and triggered from subcortical areas by a startling acoustic stimulus (SAS) without cortical involvement. Alternatively, it has been hypothesized that the SAS can trigger movements from cortical areas through a faster pathway ascending from subcortical structures. Two experiments were designed to examine the possible role of the primary motor cortex in the StartReact effect. In Experiment 1, we used suprathreshold transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during the reaction time (RT) interval to induce a cortical silent period in the contralateral primary motor cortex (M1). Thirteen participants performed 20° wrist extension movements as fast as possible in response to either a control stimulus (82 dB) or SAS (124 dB). PMTs for startle trials were faster than for control trials, while TMS significantly delayed movement onset compared to No TMS or Sham TMS conditions. In Experiment 2, we examined the StartReact effect in a highly cortically represented action involving speech of a consonant–vowel (CV) syllable. Similar to previous work examining limb movements, a robust StartReact effect was found. Collectively, these experiments provide evidence for cortical (M1) involvement in the StartReact effect.

AB  - Abstract
Major aspects of neuronal function are regulated by Ca2+ including neurotransmitter release, excitability, developmental plasticity, and gene expression. We reported previously that sensory neurons isolated from a mouse model with a heterozygous mutation of the Nf1 gene (Nf1+/−) exhibited both greater excitability and evoked release of neuropeptides compared to wildtype mice. Furthermore, augmented voltage-dependent sodium currents but not potassium currents contribute to the enhanced excitability. To determine the mechanisms giving rise to the enhanced release of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide in the Nf1+/− sensory neurons, the potential differences in the total voltage-dependent calcium current (ICa) as well as the contributions of individual Ca2+ channel subtypes were assessed. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from small-diameter capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons demonstrated that the average peak ICa densities were not different between the two genotypes. However, by using selective blockers of channel subtypes, the current density of N-type (Cav2.2) ICa was significantly larger in Nf1+/− neurons compared to wildtype neurons. In contrast, there were no significant differences in L-, P/Q- and R-type currents between the two genotypes. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction measurements made from the isolated but intact dorsal root ganglia indicated that N-type (Cav2.2) and P/Q-type (Cav2.1) Ca2+ channels exhibited the highest mRNA expression levels although there were no significant differences in the levels of mRNA expression between the genotypes. These results suggest that the augmented N-type (Cav2.2) ICa observed in the Nf1+/− sensory neurons does not result from genomic differences but may reflect post-translational or some other non-genomic modifications. Thus, our results demonstrate that sensory neurons from Nf1+/− mice, exhibit increased N-type ICa and likely account for the increased release of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide that occurs in Nf1+/− sensory neurons.

AB  - Abstract
Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), a redox cofactor in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, has been shown to protect neurons against glutamate-induced damage both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, specific inhibitors to each of the mitochondrial complexes were used to find out which reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating sites could be affected by PQQ. Then we established an in vitro model of Parkinson’s disease (PD) by exposing cultured SH-SY5Y dopaminergic cells to rotenone, a complex I inhibitor. The neuroprotective effects of PQQ were observed by pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with PQQ before rotenone injury, and the possible involvement of certain signaling pathways were investigated. PQQ pretreatment prevented SH-SY5Y cells from rotenone-induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. PQQ neuroprotection was associated with inhibition of intracellular ROS production, modulation of the expression of apoptosis-related Bcl-2 and Bax, and regulation of the level of superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and malondialdehyde. Meanwhile, PQQ up-regulated the gene expression of Ndufs 1, 2, and 4 (complex I subunits), and increased mitochondrial viability and mitochondrial DNA content. Furthermore, PQQ pretreatment activated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in rotenone-injured SH-SY5Y cells, while ERK1/2 inhibition suppressed PQQ neuroprotection. All the results suggested that PQQ could protect SH-SY5Y cells against rotenone injury by reducing ROS production and maintaining mitochondrial functions through activation of ERK1/2 pathway.

AB  - Abstract
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) is a transcriptional coactivator known to regulate gene programs in a cell-specific manner in energy-demanding tissues, and its dysfunction has been implicated in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. Previous work from the Cowell laboratory indicates that PGC-1α is concentrated in inhibitory interneurons and is required for the expression of the calcium buffer parvalbumin (PV) in the cortex; however, the impact of PGC-1α deficiency on inhibitory neurotransmission in the motor cortex is not known. Here, we show that mice lacking PGC-1α exhibit increased amplitudes and decreased frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents in layer V pyramidal neurons. Upon repetitive train stimulation at the gamma frequency, decreased GABA release is observed. Furthermore, PV-positive interneurons in PGC-1α −/− mice display reductions in intrinsic excitability and excitatory input without changes in gross interneuron morphology. Taken together, these data show that PGC-1α is required for normal inhibitory neurotransmission and cortical PV-positive interneuron function. Given the pronounced motor dysfunction in PGC-1α −/− mice and the essential role of PV-positive interneurons in maintenance of cortical excitatory:inhibitory balance, it is possible that deficiencies in PGC-1α expression could contribute to cortical hyperexcitability and motor abnormalities in multiple neurological disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Many behavioral, physiological, and anatomical studies utilize animal models to investigate human striatal pathologies. Although commonly used, rodent striatum may not present the optimal animal model for certain studies due to a lesser morphological complexity than that of non-human primates, which are increasingly restricted in research. As an alternative, the tree shrew could provide a beneficial animal model for studies of the striatum. The gross morphology of the tree shrew striatum resembles that of primates, with separation of the caudate and putamen by the internal capsule. The neurochemical anatomy of the ventral striatum, specifically the nucleus accumbens, has never been examined. This major region of the limbic system plays a role in normal physiological functioning and is also an area of interest for human striatal disorders. The current study uses immunohistochemistry of calbindin and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) to determine the ultrastructural organization of the nucleus accumbens core and shell of the tree shrew (Tupaia glis belangeri). Stereology was used to quantify the ultrastructural localization of TH, which displays weaker immunoreactivity in the core and denser immunoreactivity in the shell. In both regions, synapses with TH-immunoreactive axon terminals were primarily symmetric and showed no preference for targeting dendrites versus dendritic spines. The results were compared to previous ultrastructural studies of TH and dopamine in rat and monkey nucleus accumbens. Tree shrews and monkeys show no preference for the postsynaptic target in the shell, in contrast to rats which show a preference for synapsing with dendrites. Tree shrews have a ratio of asymmetric to symmetric synapses formed by TH-immunoreactive terminals that is intermediate between rats and monkeys. The findings from this study support the tree shrew as an alternative model for studies of human striatal pathologies.

AB  - Abstract
The primary limitation of thrombolytic treatment of ischemic stroke with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the hemorrhagic risk. We tested AcSDKP (N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline), as an auxiliary therapeutic agent, to reduce blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption in a combination tPA thrombolytic treatment of stroke. Wistar rats subjected to embolic stroke were randomly assigned to either the tPA monotherapy group (n = 9) or combination of tPA and AcSDKP treatment group (n = 9) initiated at 4 h after ischemia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements were performed before and after the treatments. Immunohistochemical staining and measurements were performed to confirm MRI findings. Longitudinal MRI permeability measurements with gadolinium-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA) demonstrated that combination treatment of acute embolic stroke with AcSDKP and tPA significantly reduced BBB leakage, compared to tPA monotherapy, at 3 and 6 days (18.3 ± 9.8 mm3 vs 65.0 ± 21.0 mm3, p &lt; 0.001) after the onset of stroke, although BBB leakage was comparable between the two groups prior to the treatments (6.8 ± 4.4 mm3 vs 4.3 ± 3.3 mm3, p &gt; 0.18). The substantial reduction of BBB leakage observed in the combination treatment group was closely associated with reduced ischemic lesions measured by T2 maps (113.6 ± 24.9 mm3 vs 188.1 ± 60.8 mm3, p &lt; 0.04 at 6 days). Histopathological analysis of the same population of rats showed that the combination treatment significantly reduced parenchymal fibrin deposition (0.063 ± 0.059 mm2 vs 0.172 ± 0.103 mm2, p &lt; 0.03) and infarct volume (146.7 ± 35.9 mm3 vs 199.3 ± 60.4 mm3, p &lt; 0.05) compared to the tPA monotherapy at 6 days after stroke. MRI provides biological insight into the therapeutic benefit of combination treatment of stroke with tPA and AcSDKP 4 h after onset, and demonstrates significantly improved cerebrovascular integrity with neuroprotective effects compared with tPA monotherapy.

AB  - Abstract
The nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays a pivotal role in reward and aversive learning and learning flexibility. Outputs of the NAc are transmitted through two parallel routes termed the direct and indirect pathways and controlled by the dopamine (DA) neurotransmitter. To explore how reward-based and avoidance learning is controlled in the NAc of the mouse, we developed the reversible neurotransmission-blocking (RNB) technique, in which transmission of each pathway could be selectively and reversibly blocked by the pathway-specific expression of transmission-blocking tetanus toxin and the asymmetric RNB technique, in which one side of the NAc was blocked by the RNB technique and the other intact side was pharmacologically manipulated by a transmitter agonist or antagonist. Our studies demonstrated that the activation of D1 receptors in the direct pathway and the inactivation of D2 receptors in the indirect pathway are key determinants that distinctly control reward-based and avoidance learning, respectively. The D2 receptor inactivation is also critical for flexibility of reward learning. Furthermore, reward and aversive learning is regulated by a set of common downstream receptors and signaling cascades, all of which are involved in the induction of long-term potentiation at cortico-accumbens synapses of the two pathways. In this article, we review our studies that specify the regulatory mechanisms of each pathway in learning behavior and propose a mechanistic model to explain how dynamic DA modulation promotes selection of actions that achieve reward-seeking outcomes and avoid aversive ones. The biological significance of the network organization consisting of two parallel transmission pathways is also discussed from the point of effective and prompt selection of neural outcomes in the neural network.

AB  - Abstract
The present study was aimed at analyzing the effects of physical exercise on mitochondrial physiology, anxio-depressive-like behaviors and neuroplasticity in mice. Adult C57BL/6J male mice were isolated in home cages equipped or not with free-running wheels. After 6 weeks of exercise, mice were tested in various behavioral paradigms to evaluate anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors. The hippocampi were dissected for neurochemical assays, including mitochondrial activity, monoamines content and the expression of genes involved in energy metabolism and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) regulation. Exercise decreased anxiety-like behaviors in the open field and elevated plus maze, and exerted antidepressant-like effects in the tail suspension test. Exercise stimulated brain mitochondrial activity and increased resistance against rotenone, an inhibitor of complex I activity. Furthermore, mRNA expression of Bdnf, Gdnf, Tfam (mitochondrial transcription factor A), and Ndufa6 (mitochondrial I subunit) genes, as well as the phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein were increased after exercise. In summary, exercise appears to engage mitochondrial pathways and to potentiate neuroplasticity and might be associated to mood improvement.

AB  - Abstract
Changes in extracellular pH have a modulatory effect on GABAA receptor function. It has been reported that pH sensitivity of the GABA receptor is dependent on subunit composition and GABA concentration. Most of previous investigations focused on GABA-evoked currents, which only reflect the postsynaptic receptors. The physiological relevance of pH modulation of GABAergic neurotransmission is not fully elucidated. In the present studies, we examined the influence of extracellular pH on the GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission in rat hypothalamic neurons. The inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), tonic currents, and the GABA-evoked currents were recorded with whole-cell patch techniques on the hypothalamic slices from Sprague–Dawley rats at 15–26 postnatal days. The amplitude and frequency of spontaneous GABA IPSCs were significantly increased while the external pH was changed from 7.3 to 8.4. In the acidic pH (6.4), the spontaneous GABA IPSCs were reduced in amplitude and frequency. The pH induced changes in miniature GABA IPSCs (mIPSCs) similar to that in spontaneous IPSCs. The pH effect on the postsynaptic GABA receptors was assessed with exogenously applied varying concentrations of GABA. The tonic currents and the currents evoked by sub-saturating concentration of GABA ([GABA]) (10 μM) were inhibited by acidic pH and potentiated by alkaline pH. In contrast, the currents evoked by saturating [GABA] (1 mM) were not affected by pH changes. We also investigated the influence of pH buffers and buffering capacity on pH sensitivity of GABAA receptors on human recombinant α1β2γ2 GABAA receptors stably expressed in HEK 293 cells. The pH influence on GABAA receptors was similar in HEPES- and MES-buffered media, and not dependent on protonated buffers, suggesting that the observed pH effect on GABA response is a specific consequence of changes in extracellular protons. Our data suggest that the hydrogen ions suppress the GABAergic neurotransmission, which is mediated by both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract
A primary goal of research on developmental critical periods (CPs) is the recapitulation of a juvenile-like state of malleability in the adult brain that might enable recovery from injury. These ambitions are often framed in terms of the simple reinstatement of enhanced plasticity in the growth-restricted milieu of an injured adult brain. Here, we provide an analysis of the similarities and differences between deprivation-induced and injury-induced cortical plasticity, to provide for a nuanced comparison of these remarkably similar processes. As a first step, we review the factors that drive ocular dominance plasticity in the primary visual cortex of the uninjured brain during the CP and in adults, to highlight processes that might confer adaptive advantage. In addition, we directly compare deprivation-induced cortical plasticity during the CP and plasticity following acute injury or ischemia in mature brain. We find that these two processes display a biphasic response profile following deprivation or injury: an initial decrease in GABAergic inhibition and synapse loss transitions into a period of neurite expansion and synaptic gain. This biphasic response profile emphasizes the transition from a period of cortical healing to one of reconnection and recovery of function. Yet while injury-induced plasticity in adult shares several salient characteristics with deprivation-induced plasticity during the CP, the degree to which the adult injured brain is able to functionally rewire, and the time required to do so, present major limitations for recovery. Attempts to recapitulate a measure of CP plasticity in an adult injury context will need to carefully dissect the circuit alterations and plasticity mechanisms involved while measuring functional behavioral output to assess their ultimate success.

Physical exercise could exert a neuroprotective effect in both clinical studies and animal experiments. A series of related studies have indicated that physical exercise could reduce infarct volume, alleviate neurological deficits, decrease blood–brain barrier dysfunction, promote angiogenesis in cerebral vascular system and increase the survival rate after ischemic stroke. In this review, we summarized the protective effects of physical exercise on neurovascular unit (NVU), including neurons, astrocytes, pericytes and the extracellular matrix. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that exercise training could decrease the blood–brain barrier dysfunction and promote angiogenesis in cerebral vascular system. An awareness of the exercise intervention benefits pre- and post stroke may lead more stroke patients and people with high-risk factors to accept exercise therapy for the prevention and treatment of stroke.

AB  - Abstract
Mental and neurological illnesses affect one in four people. While genetic linkage analyses have shown an association of nuclear distribution factor E (NDE1, or NudE) and its ohnolog NDE-like 1 (NDEL1, or Nudel) with mental disorders, the cellular mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we have demonstrated that Nde1 and Ndel1 are differentially localised in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the forebrain and the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus, two regions where neurogenesis actively occurs in the adult brain. Nde1, but not Ndel1, is localized to putative SVZ stem cells, and to actively dividing progenitors of the SGZ. The influence of these proteins on neural stem cell differentiation was investigated by overexpression in a hippocampal neural stem cell line, HCN-A94. Increasing Nde1 expression in this neural stem cell line led to increased neuronal differentiation while decreasing levels of astroglial differentiation. In primary cultured neurons and astrocytes, Nde1 and Ndel1 were found to have different but comparable subcellular localizations. In addition, we have shown for the first time that Nde1 is heterogeneously distributed in cortical astrocytes of human brains. Our data indicate that Nde1 and Ndel1 have distinct but overlapping distribution patterns in mouse brain and cultured nerve cells. They may function differently and therefore their dosage changes may contribute to some aspects of mental disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Mutation of TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) is detected in familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS and SALS). TDP-43-positive cytoplasmic inclusions are present in both neuron and glia of ALS, although not in mutant Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (mSOD1)-related or RNA binding protein Fused in sarcoma (FUS)-related ALS. Previous studies have established that cortical hyper-excitability is common to both FALS and SALS patients. Much of our current understanding of neuron excitability has come from studying the subtype of mSOD1-related ALS. Thus, we evaluated the excitable capability through analyzing properties of action potentials (APs) and voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels on the cellular model, motoneuron-like cell lines that were steadily transfected with mutant Q331K and wild-type TDP-43. We found that wild-type TDP-43 increased firing frequency of APs, but the presence of mutant Q331K TDP-43 enhanced firing frequency and decreased the threshold of APs to a higher level. Further, we observed that mutant Q331K and wild-type TDP-43 induced more rapid speed of recovery from fast and slow inactivation of Nav channels and resulted in a reduction of voltage dependency of slow inactivation. These results provide evidence for high excitability that resulted from the presence of mutant and wild-type TDP-43, and more toxicity of mutant TDP-43 than wild-type. Other studies suggest that Nav channel activity can be increased directly by different oxidative species and, we have shown previously that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction occurs simultaneously in the cellular model of mutant TDP-43 and can be ameliorated by dimethoxy curcumin (DMC), a safe and effective antioxidant. In the present study we found that the abnormities of APs and Nav channels were significantly ameliorated when treated with DMC (15 μM) for 24 h, suggesting a dropping-excitability state. Taken together, mutant Q331K TDP-43 induces high excitability in a motoneuron-like cellular model, and this abnormal state is rescued by DMC which may act through alleviation of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction.

AB  - Abstract
Efficient sensory processing of the environment is a critical function for any organism to survive and is accomplished by having neurons adapt their responses to stimuli based on behavioral context in part through neuromodulators such as serotonin (5-HT). We have recently shown that one critical function of the serotonergic system in weakly electric fish is to enhance sensory pyramidal neuron responses within the electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) to stimuli caused by same sex conspecifics, thereby enhancing their perception. This enhancement is accomplished by making pyramidal neurons more excitable through downregulation of potassium channels. However, the nature of the 5-HT receptors that mediate this effect is not known. Here we show that the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin (ket) can effectively block the effects of 5-HT on pyramidal neuron excitability in vitro. Indeed, 5-HT application subsequent to ket application did not cause any significant changes in neuron excitability and responses to current injection. We further show that ket applied in vivo can block the effects of 5-HT on behavioral responses. Thus, our results strongly suggest that the previously observed effects of 5-HT on sensory processing within ELL and their consequences for behavior are mediated by 5-HT2 receptors.

KW  - SGCZ mutations
AB  - AbstractBackground
Myoclonus dystonia syndrome (MDS) is a hyperkinetic movement disorder caused, in a proportion of cases, by mutations of the maternally imprinted epsilon-sarcoglycan gene (SGCE). SGCE mutation rates vary between cohorts, suggesting genetic heterogeneity. E- and ζ-sarcoglycan are both expressed in brain tissue. In this study we tested whether zeta-sarcoglycan gene (SGCZ) mutations also contribute to this disorder.
Methods
Patients with clinically suspected MDS and no SGCE mutation were recruited and classified, according to previously published criteria, as to their likelihood of the movement disorder. All SGCZ exons and intron/exon boundaries were screened by direct sequencing.
Results
Fifty-four SGCE mutation-negative patients were recruited from the UK and the Netherlands. Subdivided according to the likelihood of the movement disorder resulted in 17 ‘definite’, 16 ‘probable’ and 21 ‘possible’ cases. No pathogenic SGCZ mutations were identified.
Conclusions
SGCZ mutations are unlikely to contribute to the genetic heterogeneity in MDS.

AB  - Abstract
Chronic pain reflects not only sensitization of the ascending nociceptive pathways, but also changes in descending modulation. The rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) is a key structure in a well-studied descending pathway, and contains two classes of modulatory neurons, the ON-cells and the OFF-cells. Disinhibition of OFF-cells depresses nociception; increased ON-cell activity facilitates nociception. Multiple lines of evidence show that sensitization of ON-cells contributes to chronic pain, and reversing or blocking this sensitization is of interest as a treatment of persistent pain. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) acting via the Y1 receptor has been shown to attenuate hypersensitivity in nerve-injured animals without affecting normal nociception when microinjected into the RVM, but the neural basis for this effect was unknown. We hypothesized that behavioral anti-hyperalgesia was due to selective inhibition of ON-cells by NPY at the Y1 receptor. To explore the possibility of Y1 selectivity on ON-cells, we stained for the NPY-Y1 receptor in the RVM, and found it broadly expressed on both serotonergic and non-serotonergic neurons. In subsequent behavioral experiments, NPY microinjected into the RVM in lightly anesthetized animals reversed signs of mechanical hyperalgesia following either nerve injury or chronic hindpaw inflammation. Unexpectedly, rather than decreasing ON-cell activity, NPY increased spontaneous activity of both ON- and OFF-cells without altering noxious-evoked changes in firing. Based on these results, we conclude that the anti-hyperalgesic effects of NPY in the RVM are not explained by selective inhibition of ON-cells, but rather by increased spontaneous activity of OFF-cells. Although ON-cells undoubtedly facilitate nociception and contribute to hypersensitivity, the present results highlight the importance of parallel OFF-cell-mediated descending inhibition in limiting the expression of chronic pain.

AB  - Abstract
Acute brain injuries cause rapid cell death that activates bidirectional crosstalk between the injured brain and the immune system.

In the acute phase, the damaged CNS activates resident and circulating immune cells via the local and systemic release of soluble mediators. This early immune activation is necessary to confine the injured tissue and foster the clearance of cellular debris, thus bringing the inflammatory reaction to a close. In the chronic phase, a sustained immune activation has been described in many CNS disorders, and the degree of this prolonged response has variable effects on spontaneous brain regenerative processes. The challenge for treating acute CNS damage is to understand how to optimally engage and modify these immune responses, thus providing new strategies that will compensate for tissue lost to injury.

Herein we have reviewed the available information regarding the role and function of the innate and adaptive immune responses in influencing CNS plasticity during the acute and chronic phases of after injury. We have examined how CNS damage evolves along the activation of main cellular and molecular pathways that are associated with intrinsic repair, neuronal functional plasticity and facilitation of tissue reorganization.

AB  - Abstract
Interactions between neurotransmitters and the immune system represent new prospects for understanding neuroinflammation and associated neurological disease. GABA is the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter but its actions on immune pathways in the brain are unclear. In the present study, we investigated GABAergic transport in conjunction with neuroinflammation in models of multiple sclerosis (MS). Protein and mRNA levels of γ-amino butyric acid transporter 2 (GAT-2) were examined in cerebral white matter from MS and control (Non-MS) patients, in cultured human macrophages, microglia and astrocytes, and in spinal cords from mice with and without experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) using western blotting, immunocytochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). GABA levels were measured by HPLC. The GAT-2′s expression was increased in MS patients’ (n = 6) white matter, particularly in macrophage lineage cells, compared to Non-MS patients (n = 6) (p &lt; 0.05). Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) stimulation of human macrophage lineage cells induced GAT-2 expression and reduced extracellular GABA levels (p &lt; 0.05) but soluble GABA treatment suppressed HLA-DRα, GAT-2 and XBP-1/s expression in stimulated macrophage lineage cells (p &lt; 0.05). Similarly, the synthetic allopregnanolone analog, ganaxolone (GNX), repressed GAT-2, JAK-1 and STAT-1 expression in activated macrophage lineage cells (p &lt; 0.05). In vivo GNX treatment reduced Gat-2, Cd3ε, MhcII, and Xbp-1/s expression in spinal cords following EAE induction (p &lt; 0.05), which was correlated with improved neurobehavioral outcomes and reduced neuroinflammation, demyelination and axonal injury. These findings highlight altered GABAergic transport through GAT-2 induction during neuroinflammation. GABA transport and neuroinflammation are closely coupled but regulated by GNX, pointing to GABAergic pathways as therapeutic targets in neuroinflammatory diseases.

AB  - Abstract
White matter injury in the premature infant leads to motor and more commonly behavioral and cognitive problems that are a tremendous burden to society. While there has been much progress in understanding unique vulnerabilities of developing oligodendrocytes over the past 30 years, there remain no proven therapies for the premature infant beyond supportive care. The lack of translational progress may be partially explained by the challenge of developing relevant animal models when the etiology remains unclear, as is the case in this disorder. There has been an emphasis on hypoxia–ischemia and infection/inflammation as upstream etiologies, but less consideration of other contributory factors. This review highlights the evolution of white matter pathology in the premature infant, discusses the prevailing proposed etiologies, critically analyzes a sampling of common animal models and provides detailed support for our hypothesis that nutritional and hormonal deprivation may be additional factors playing critical and overlooked roles in white matter pathology in the premature infant.

AB  - Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder causing severe motor disabilities resulting from the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) region of the midbrain. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs which play a major role in several cellular processes in health and disease by regulating gene expression post-transcriptionally. Aberrant miRNA expression has been detected in post-mortem human PD brain samples, in vitro and in vivo PD models. However, none of the studies have focused on the role of the brain-abundant miR-124 in PD. In this study, we have evaluated the expression changes of miR-124 in the SN of the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model. MiRNA expression analysis by qPCR revealed a decrease in the expression of brain-enriched miR-124 in the SN of MPTP-treated mice as compared to controls. Further, in vitro study revealed a decrease in the expression of miR-124 in MN9D dopaminergic neurons treated with methyl phenyl pyridinium (MPP) iodide. The expression of calpains 1 and 2 which is modulated by miR-124 was increased in the SNc of MPTP-treated mice as observed at different time points after treatment and in the MN9D dopaminergic neurons treated with MPP iodide leading to increased expression of the p35 cleavage product, p25 and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5). Calpain-p25-mediated increase in cdk5 expression leading to dopaminergic neuronal death has been demonstrated in human PD and MPTP-PD models. Increased expression of calpain 1/cdk5 pathway proteins was observed in anti-miR-124-transfected MN9D cells in our studies. Knockdown of miR-124 led to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) both known to increase oxidative stress. Further, experiments with miR-124 target protector sequences specific to calpain 1 revealed an interaction of miR-124 with calpain 1. Overexpression of miR-124 after MPP iodide treatment on MN9D cells was found to attenuate the expression of the calpain 1/p25/cdk5 proteins while improving cell survival. These results suggest that miR-124 acts to modulate the expression of calpain/cdk5 pathway proteins in the dopaminergic neurons. A better understanding of the mechanisms controlling the expression of miR-124 will aid in targeting miR-124 for better treatment strategies for PD.

AB  - Abstract
Following traumatic brain injury (TBI) SUR1-regulated NCCa-ATP (SUR1/TRPM4) channels are transcriptionally up-regulated in ischemic astrocytes, neurons, and capillaries. ATP depletion results in depolarization and opening of the channel leading to cytotoxic edema. Glibenclamide is an inhibitor of SUR-1 and, thus, might prevent cytotoxic edema and secondary brain damage following TBI.

Anesthetized adult Sprague–Dawley rats underwent parietal craniotomy and were subjected to controlled cortical impact injury (CCI). Glibenclamide was administered as a bolus injection 15 min after CCI injury and continuously via osmotic pumps throughout 7 days. In an acute trial (180 min) mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, intracranial pressure, encephalographic activity, and cerebral metabolism were monitored. Brain water content was assessed gravimetrically 24 h after CCI injury and contusion volumes were measured by MRI scanning technique at 8 h, 24 h, 72 h, and 7 d post injury. Throughout the entire time of observation neurological function was quantified using the “beam-walking” test.

Glibenclamide-treated animals showed a significant reduction in the development of brain tissue water content(80.47% ± 0.37% (glibenclamide) vs. 80.83% ± 0.44% (control); p &lt; 0.05; n = 14). Contusion sizes increased continuously within 72 h following CCI injury, but glibenclamide-treated animals had significantly smaller volumes at any time-points, like 172.53 ± 38.74 mm3 (glibenclamide) vs. 299.20 ± 64.02 mm3 (control) (p &lt; 0.01; n = 10; 24 h) or 211.10 ± 41.03 mm3 (glibenclamide) vs. 309.76 ± 19.45 mm3 (control) (p &lt; 0.05; n = 10; 72 h), respectively. An effect on acute parameters, however, could not be detected, most likely because of the up-regulation of the channel within 3–6 h after injury. Furthermore, there was no significant effect on motor function assessed by the beam-walking test throughout 7 days.

In accordance to these results and the available literature, glibenclamide seems to have promising potency in the treatment of TBI.

AB  - Abstract
Background: Up-regulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and altered cholesterol (CH) metabolism are characteristic of Alzheimer-diseased (AD) neural tissues. We previously provided evidence of significant HO-1/sterol interactions in vitro (cultured rat astroglia) and in post-mortem human AD brain (Religious Orders Study). Methods: The current experiments were designed to further delineate these interactions in vivo by comparing the behavior of HO-1/sterol interactions in two mouse models; (1) a novel HO-1 transgenic mouse (GFAP.HMOX1) engineered to selectively express human HO-1 in the astrocytic compartment and (2) the previously described triple transgenic AD mouse (3xTg-AD). In samples of frontal cortex, total CH, CH precursors and relevant oxysterols were quantified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and HO-1 protein expression was assessed by ELISA. The relationships of HO-1 expression to total CH, CH precursors and total oxysterols were determined for both mouse models using linear regression analysis. Results: HO-1 expression is increased in GFAP.HMOX1 mice relative to wild type and in 11–12-month-old 3xTg-AD mice (with AD-like phenotype) relative to control mice and 5–6-month-old 3xTg-AD mice (no AD-like phenotype). Total oxysterols significantly decreased as HO-1 expression increased in GFAP.HMOX1 mice expressing high levels of HO-1, whereas total oxysterols increased as HO-1 expression increased in aged 3xTg-AD mice. Total CH and total CH precursors increased as HO-1 protein expression increased in 11–12-month-old 3xTg-AD mice relative to 5–6-month old 3xTg-AD mice. Conclusions: Our findings indicate a differential impact of HO-1 on patterns of brain sterol and redox homeostasis that is contingent on the presence or absence of AD-like neuropathology. These data provide fresh insight concerning the regulation of sterol homeostasis within the aging and degenerating CNS which may inform the development of novel therapeutic and preventive strategies for the management of AD and related conditions.

AB  - Abstract
Stress dramatically affects synaptic plasticity of the hippocampus, disrupts paired-pulse facilitation and impairs long-term potentiation (LTP). This study was performed to find the effects of chronic restraint stress and recovery period on excitability, paired-pulse response, LTP and to find probable adaptation to very long stress in the dentate gyrus. Thirty-eight male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups of Control, Rest–Stress (21 days stress), Stress–Rest (recovery) and Stress–Stress (42 days stress: adaptation). Chronic restraint stress was applied 6-h/day. Input–output functions, paired-pulse responses and LTP were recorded from the dentate gyrus while stimulating the perforant pathway. We found that chronic stress attenuated the responsiveness, paired-pulse response and LTP in the dentate gyrus. A 21-day recovery period, after the stress, improved all the three responses toward normal, indicating reversibility of these stress-related hippocampal changes. There was no significant adaptation to very long stress, probably due to severity of stress.

AB  - Abstract
CNS immune signaling contributes to deleterious opioid effects including hyperalgesia, tolerance, reward, and dependence/withdrawal. Such effects are mediated by opioid signaling at toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), presumptively of glial origin. Whether CNS endothelial cells express TLR4 is controversial. If so, they would be well positioned for activation by blood-borne opioids, contributing to opioid-induced pro-inflammatory responses. These studies examined adult primary rat CNS endothelial cell responses to (−)-morphine or its mu opioid receptor (MOR)-inactive metabolite morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G), both known TLR4 agonists. We demonstrate that adult rat CNS endothelial cells express functional TLR4. M3G activated nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB), increased tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) mRNAs, and released prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from these cells. (−)-Morphine-induced upregulation of TNFα mRNA and PGE2 release were unmasked by pre-treatment with nalmefene, a MOR antagonist without TLR4 activity (unlike CTAP, shown to have both MOR- and TLR4-activity), suggestive of an interplay between MOR and TLR4 co-activation by (−)-morphine. In support, MOR-dependent Protein Kinase A (PKA) opposed TLR4 signaling, as PKA inhibition (H-89) also unmasked (−)-morphine-induced TNFα and COX2 mRNA upregulation. Intrathecal injection of CNS endothelial cells, stimulated in vitro with M3G, produced TLR4-dependent tactile allodynia. Further, cortical suffusion with M3G in vivo induced TLR4-dependent vasodilation. Finally, endothelial cell TLR4 activation by lipopolysaccharide and/or M3G was blocked by the glial inhibitors AV1013 and propentofylline, demonstrating endothelial cells as a new target of such drugs. These data indicate that (−)-morphine and M3G can activate CNS endothelial cells via TLR4, inducing proinflammatory, biochemical, morphological, and behavioral sequelae. CNS endothelial cells may have previously unanticipated roles in opioid-induced effects, in phenomena blocked by presumptive glial inhibitors, as well as TLR4-mediated phenomena more broadly.

AB  - Abstract
Electrocortical and hemodynamic measures reliably identify enhanced activity in the ventral and dorsal visual cortices during the perception of emotionally arousing versus neutral images, an effect that may reflect directive feedback from the subcortical amygdala. However, other brain regions strongly modulate visual attention, such as frontal eye fields (FEF) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Here we employ rapid sampling of BOLD signal (4 Hz) in the amygdala, fusiform gyrus (FG), FEF and IPS in 42 human participants as they viewed a series of emotional and neutral natural scene photographs balanced for luminosity and complexity, to test whether emotional discrimination is evident in dorsal structures prior to such discrimination in the amygdala and FG. Granger causality analyses were used to assess directional connectivity within dorsal and ventral networks. Results demonstrate emotionally-enhanced peak BOLD signal in the amygdala, FG, FEF, and IPS, with the onset of BOLD signal discrimination occurring between 2 and 3 s after stimulus onset in ventral structures, and between 4 and 5 s in FEF and IPS. Granger causality estimates yield stronger directional connectivity from IPS to FEF than the reverse in this emotional picture paradigm. Consistent with a reentrant perspective of emotional scene perception, greater directional connectivity was found from the amygdala to FG compared to the reverse. These data support a perspective in which the registration of emotional scene content is orchestrated by the amygdala and rostral inferotemporal visual cortex.

AB  - Abstract
The ability to discriminate between closely related contexts is a specific form of hippocampal-dependent learning that may be impaired in certain neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Down Syndrome. However, signaling pathways regulating this form of learning are poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that the calcium-dependent exchange factor Ras-GRF1, an activator of Rac, Ras and R-Ras GTPases, is important for this form of learning and memory. Moreover, the ability to discriminate contexts was linked to the ability of Ras-GRF1 to promote high-frequency stimulation long-term potentiation (HFS-LTP) via the activation of p38 Map kinase. Here, we show that R-Ras is involved in this form of learning by using virally-delivered miRNAs targeting R-Ras into the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus and observing impaired contextual discrimination. Like the loss of GRF1, knockdown of R-Ras in the CA1 also impairs the induction of HFS-LTP and p38 Map kinase. Nevertheless, experiments indicate that this involvement of R-Ras in HFS-LTP that is required for contextual discrimination is independent of Ras-GRF1. Thus, R-Ras is a novel regulator of a form of hippocampal-dependent LTP as well as learning and memory that is affected in certain forms of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Abstract
High accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutaric acid (D-2-HG) is the biochemical hallmark of patients affected by the inherited neurometabolic disorder D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (D-2-HGA). Clinically, patients present neurological symptoms and basal ganglia injury whose pathophysiology is poorly understood. We investigated the ex vivo effects of intrastriatal administration of D-2-HG on important parameters of redox status in the striatum of weaning rats. D-2-HG in vivo administration increased malondialdehyde (MDA) and carbonyl formation (lipid and protein oxidative damage, respectively), as well as the production of reactive nitrogen species (RNS). D-2-HG also compromised the antioxidant defenses by decreasing reduced glutathione (GSH) concentrations, as well as the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Increased amounts of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) with no significant alteration of total glutathione (tGS) were also found. Furthermore, D-2-HG-induced lipid oxidation and reduction of GSH concentrations and GPx activity were prevented by the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist dizocilpine maleate (MK-801) and the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), suggesting the participation of NMDA receptors and nitric oxide derivatives in these effects. Creatine also impeded D-2-HG-elicited MDA increase, but did not change the D-2-HG-induced diminution of GSH and of the activities of SOD and GPx. We also found that DCFH oxidation and H2O2 production were not altered by D-2-HG, making unlikely an important role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reinforcing the participation of RNS in the oxidative damage and the reduction of antioxidant defenses provoked by this organic acid. Vacuolization, lymphocytic infiltrates and macrophages indicating brain damage were also observed in the striatum of rats injected with D-2-HG. The present data provide in vivo solid evidence that D-2-HG disrupts redox homeostasis and causes histological alterations in the rat striatum probably mediated by NMDA overstimulation and RNS production. It is therefore presumed that disturbance of redox status may contribute at least in part to the basal ganglia alterations characteristic of patients affected by D-2-HGA.

In vitro studies have demonstrated that β2-adrenergic receptor activation stimulates glycogen degradation in astrocytes, generating lactate as a potential energy source for neurons. Using in vivo microdialysis in mouse cerebellar white matter we demonstrate continuous axonal lactate uptake and glial–axonal metabolic coupling of glutamate/lactate exchange. However, this physiological lactate production was not influenced by activation (clenbuterol) or blocking (ICI 118551) of β2-adrenergic receptors. In two-photon imaging experiments on ex vivo mouse corpus callosum subjected to aglycemia, β2-adrenergic activation rescued axons, whereas inhibition of axonal lactate uptake by α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (4-CIN) was associated with severe axonal loss.

Our results suggest that axonal protective effects of glial β2-adrenergic receptor activation are not mediated by enhanced lactate production.

AB  - Abstract
Hirulog-like peptide (HLP) and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) are thrombin inhibitor peptides. Our previous study demonstrated that HLP could reduce vascular neointimal formation or restenosis in animals undergoing balloon catheter injury in the carotid artery. However, the function of HLP during ischemic stroke is largely unknown. The present study investigated the effect of HLP on brain injury, which was induced by suture of middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. Mice were divided into four groups, which included a sham group and three treatment groups. Ischemia was induced by transient suture insertion into the middle cerebral artery for 90 min, and mice were either treated with saline, HLP or LMWH. Infarct volume, neurologic deficits and apoptotic factors were measured following 1–14 days of ischemia. We demonstrated that HLP intravenous injection alleviated brain infarct volume and improved neurologic outcomes (p &lt; 0.05). HLP decreased levels of protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), caspase-3, malondialdehyde (MDA) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), increased the activities of catalase and B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), and improved the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax compared with the control (p &lt; 0.05). This study indicates that HLP and LMWH reduced infarct volume and improved neurobehavioral outcomes induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). In addition, HLP had a beneficial effect on the regulation of the thrombin receptor and key apoptosis regulators in the mouse brain. These results suggest that HLP may be a potential alternative therapy for arterial occlusion-induced cerebral ischemia.

AB  - Abstract
Enhanced brain apoptosis (neurons and glia) may be involved in major depression (MD) and schizophrenia (SZ), mainly through the activation of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway. In the extrinsic death pathway, pro-apoptotic Fas-associated death domain (FADD) adaptor and its non-apoptotic p-Ser194 FADD form have critical roles interacting with other death regulators such as phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes of 15 kDa (PEA-15) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). The basal status of FADD (protein and messenger RNA (mRNA)) and the effects of psychotropic drugs (detected in blood/urine samples) were first assessed in postmortem prefrontal cortex of MD and SZ subjects (including a non-MD/SZ suicide group). In MD, p-FADD, but not total FADD (and mRNA), was increased (26%, n = 24; all MD subjects) as well as p-FADD/FADD ratio (a pro-survival marker) in antidepressant-free MD subjects (50%, n = 10). In contrast, cortical FADD (and mRNA), p-FADD, and p-FADD/FADD were not altered in SZ brains (n = 21) regardless of antipsychotic medications (except enhanced mRNA in treated subjects). Similar negative results were quantified in the non-MD/SZ suicide group. In MD, the regulation of multifunctional PEA-15 (i.e., p-Ser116 PEA-15 blocks pro-apoptotic FADD and PEA-15 prevents pro-survival ERK action) and the modulation of p-ERK1/2 were also investigated. Cortical p-PEA-15 was not changed whereas PEA-15 was increased mainly in antidepressant-treated subjects (16–20%). Interestingly, cortical p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2 ratio was reduced (33%) in antidepressant-free when compared to antidepressant-treated MD subjects. The neurochemical adaptations of brain FADD (increased p-FADD and pro-survival p-FADD/FADD ratio), as well as its interaction with PEA-15, could play a major role to counteract the known activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in MD.

AB  - Abstract
Visually-driven actions and perception are traditionally ascribed to the dorsal and ventral visual streams of the cortical processing hierarchy. However, motion perception and the control of tracking eye movements both depend on sensory motion analysis by neurons in the dorsal stream, suggesting that the same sensory circuits may underlie both action and perception. Previous studies have suggested that multiple sensory modules may be responsible for the perception of low- and high-level motion, or the detection versus identification of motion direction. However, it remains unclear whether the sensory processing systems that contribute to direction perception and the control of eye movements have the same neuronal constraints. To address this, we examined inter-individual variability across 36 observers, using two tasks that simultaneously assessed the precision of eye movements and direction perception: in the smooth pursuit task, observers volitionally tracked a small moving target and reported its direction; in the ocular following task, observers reflexively tracked a large moving stimulus and reported its direction. We determined perceptual–oculomotor correlations across observers, defined as the correlation between each observer’s mean perceptual precision and mean oculomotor precision. Across observers, we found that: (i) mean perceptual precision was correlated between the two tasks; (ii) mean oculomotor precision was correlated between the tasks, and (iii) oculomotor and perceptual precision were correlated for volitional smooth pursuit, but not reflexive ocular following. Collectively, these results demonstrate that sensory circuits with common neuronal constraints subserve motion perception and volitional, but not reflexive eye movements.

AB  - Abstract
Hydrocephalus is caused by the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the cerebral ventricular system which results in an enlargement of the cranium due to increased intraventricular pressure. The increase in pressure within the brain typically results in sloughing of ciliated ependymal cells, loss of cortical gray matter, and increased gliosis. Congenital hydrocephalus is associated with several syndromes including primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a rare, genetically heterogeneous, pediatric syndrome that results from defects in motile cilia and flagella. We have examined the morphological and physiological defects in the brains of two mouse models of PCD, nm1054 and bgh, which have mutations in Pcdp1 (also known as Cfap221) and Spef2, respectively. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of mice with these mutations on the C57BL/6J and 129S6/SvEvTac genetic backgrounds demonstrate strain-dependent morphological brain damage. Alterations in astrocytosis, microglial activation, myelination, and the neuronal population were identified and are generally more severe on the C57BL/6J background. Analysis of ependymal ciliary clearance ex vivo and CSF flow in vivo demonstrate a physiological defect in nm1054 and bgh mice on both genetic backgrounds, indicating that abnormal cilia-driven flow is not the sole determinant of the severity of hydrocephalus in these models. These results suggest that genetic modifiers play an important role in susceptibility to severe PCD-associated hydrocephalus.

AB  - Abstract
Injury to the adult nervous system promotes the expression and secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Because it promotes neuronal growth, survival and neurogenesis, BDNF may initiate compensatory processes that mitigate the deleterious effects of injury, disease or stress. Despite this, BDNF has been implicated in several injury-induced maladaptive processes including pain, spasticity and convulsive activity. This review will concentrate on the predominant role of BDNF in the initiation and maintenance of chronic and/or neuropathic pain at the spinal, peripheral and central levels. Within the spinal dorsal horn, the pattern of BDNF-induced changes in synaptic transmission across five different, identified neuronal phenotypes bears a striking resemblance to that produced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of peripheral nerves. The appearance of this “pain footprint” thus reflects multiple sensitizing actions of microglial-derived BDNF. These include changes in the chloride equilibrium potential, decreased excitatory synaptic drive to inhibitory neurons, complex changes in inhibitory (GABA/glycinergic) synaptic transmission, increases in excitatory synaptic drive to excitatory neurons and the appearance of oscillatory activity. BDNF effects are confined to changes in synaptic transmission as there is little change in the passive or active properties of neurons in the superficial dorsal horn. Actions of BDNF in the brain stem and periphery also contribute to the onset and persistence of chronic pain. In spite of its role in compensatory processes that facilitate the recovery of the nervous system from injury, the widespread maladaptive actions of BDNF mean that there is literally “no gain without pain”.

AB  - Abstract
Uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) reduces oxidative stress by facilitating the influx of protons into mitochondrial matrix, thus dissociating mitochondrial oxidation from ATP synthesis. UCP2 is expressed abundantly in brain areas and plays a key role in neuroprotection. Here, we sought to determine if UCP2 deficiency produces cognitive impairment and anxiety in young mice, and to determine if hippocampal UCP2 is essential for the beneficial effects of voluntary exercise. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) was used to produce UCP2 knockdown in mice. Our results firstly showed that UCP2-targeted ASO significantly reduced UCP2 mRNA and protein expression in the hippocampus. ASO treatment impaired learning and memory of the mice in Y-maze, T-maze, and object recognition tests (ORT). ASO-treated mice exhibited more anxiously in OPT, light/dark box test, and elevated plus maze (EPM) than the control mice. We also found that wheel running ameliorated cognitive dysfunction and anxiety-like behaviors in ASO-treated mice. Furthermore, voluntary exercise reversed ASO-induced changes in hippocampal levels of serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE). However, UCP2 protein in the hippocampus was not correlated with cognitive and anxiolytic benefits of exercise. These findings suggest that hippocampal UCP2 is essential for cognitive function and the resistance to anxiety of mice, but not required for the beneficial effects of exercise.

AB  - Abstract
P2X7 receptors play an important role in inflammatory hyperalgesia, but the mechanisms involved in their hyperalgesic role are not completely understood. In this study, we hypothesized that P2X7 receptor activation induces mechanical hyperalgesia via the inflammatory mediators bradykinin, sympathomimetic amines, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and pro-inflammatory cytokines and via neutrophil migration in rats. We found that 2′(3′)-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)adenosine 5′-triphosphate triethylammonium salt (BzATP), the most potent P2X7 receptor agonist available, induced a dose-dependent mechanical hyperalgesia that was blocked by the P2X7 receptor-selective antagonist A-438079 but unaffected by the P2X1,3,2/3 receptor antagonist TNP-ATP. These findings confirm that, although BzATP also acts at both P2X1 and P2X3 receptors, BzATP-induced hyperalgesia was mediated only by P2X7 receptor activation. Co-administration of selective antagonists of bradykinin B1 (Des-Arg8-Leu9-BK (DALBK)) or B2 receptors (bradyzide), β1 (atenolol) or β2 adrenoceptors (ICI 118,551), or local pre-treatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin or the nonspecific selectin inhibitor fucoidan each significantly reduced BzATP-induced mechanical hyperalgesia in the rat hind paw. BzATP also induced the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 (CINC-1), an effect that was significantly reduced by A-438079. Co-administration of DALBK or bradyzide with BzATP significantly reduced BzATP-induced IL-1β and CINC-1 release. These results indicate that peripheral P2X7 receptor activation induces mechanical hyperalgesia via inflammatory mediators, especially bradykinin, which may contribute to pro-inflammatory cytokine release. These pro-inflammatory cytokines in turn may mediate the contributions of PGE2, sympathomimetic amines and neutrophil migration to the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by local P2X7 receptor activation.

AB  - Abstract
Risk of schizophrenia is likely to involve gene × environment (G × E) interactions. Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) is a schizophrenia risk gene, hence any interaction with environmental adversity, such as maternal infection, may provide further insights into the basis of the disease. This study examined the individual and combined effects of prenatal immune activation with polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidilic acid (Poly I:C) and disruption of the schizophrenia risk gene NRG1 on the expression of behavioral phenotypes related to schizophrenia.

NRG1 heterozygous (NRG1 HET) mutant breeding pairs were time-mated. Pregnant dams received a single injection (5 mg/kg i.p.) of Poly I:C or vehicle on gestation day 9 (GD9). Offspring were then cross-fostered to vehicle-treated or Poly I:C-treated dams. Expression of schizophrenia-related behavioral endophenotypes was assessed at adolescence and in adulthood.

Combining NRG1 disruption and prenatal environmental insult (Poly I:C) caused developmental stage-specific deficits in social behavior, spatial working memory and prepulse inhibition (PPI). However, combining Poly I:C and cross-fostering produced a number of behavioral deficits in the open field, social behavior and PPI. This became more complex by combining NRG1 deletion with both Poly I:C exposure and cross-fostering, which had a robust effect on PPI.

These findings suggest that concepts of G × E interaction in risk of schizophrenia should be elaborated to multiple interactions that involve individual genes interacting with diverse biological and psychosocial environmental factors over early life, to differentially influence particular domains of psychopathology, sometimes over specific stages of development.

AB  - Abstract
Glutamate transporter type 3 (EAAT3) may play a role in cognition. Isoflurane enhances EAAT3 trafficking to the plasma membrane. Thus, we used isoflurane to determine how EAAT3 might regulate learning and memory and the trafficking of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors, such as GluR1, to the plasma membrane, a fundamental biochemical process for learning and memory. Here, isoflurane increased EAAT3 but did not change GluR1 levels in the plasma membrane of wild-type mouse hippocampus. Isoflurane increased protein phosphatase activity in the wild-type and EAAT3−/− mouse hippocampus. Also, isoflurane reduced GluR1 in the plasma membrane and decreased phospho-GluR1 in EAAT3−/− mice. The phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid attenuated these effects. Finally, isoflurane inhibited context-related fear conditioning in EAAT3−/− mice but not in wild-type mice. Thus, isoflurane may increase GluR1 trafficking to the plasma membrane via EAAT3 and inhibit GluR1 trafficking via protein phosphatase. Lack of EAAT3 effects leads to decreased GluR1 trafficking and impaired cognition after isoflurane exposure in EAAT3−/− mice.

The total number of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in the mouse main olfactory epithelium (MOE) was estimated using stereological sampling. Noses and skulls of male and female 8-week-old C57BL/6J mice were de-calcified, embedded in paraffin, cut into 10-μm-thick sections serially at 100-μm intervals, and processed for immunohistochemistry for the olfactory marker protein (OMP), a specific marker for ORNs. The number of OMP (+) receptor neurons was measured using an optical fractionator with the Stereo-Investigator software. The mean values of the total number of OMP (+) receptor neurons in the unilateral MOE were 5,140,000 ± 380,000 in males and 5,210,000 ± 380,000 in females, with no significant differences between the sexes. We concluded that the total number of ORNs in the unilateral MOE is approximately 5 × 106 in mice.

AB  - Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes cognitive impairment. Major pathophysiological AD characteristics include numerous senile plaque, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss in the specific regions of patients’ brains. In this study, we aimed to understand disease stage-dependent regulation of histone modification for the expression of specific markers in plasma and the hippocampus of in vivo AD model. Since the control of histone acetylation/deacetylation has been studied as one of major epigenetic regulatory mechanisms for specific gene expression, we detected the effects of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor on marker expression and neuroprotection in in vivo AD model mice. We determined the effects of valproic acid (VPA, HDAC inhibitor), on the levels of cytokines, secreted form of APP (sAPP), nerve growth factor (NGF), and cognitive function in Tg6799 AD mice in three different disease stages (1 month: pre-symptomatic; 5 months: early symptomatic; and 10 months: late-symptomatic stages). VPA decreased the mRNA levels of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) and IL-1ß in the plasma of Tg6799 mice compared to vehicle control at 10 months of age. VPA increased the protein levels of NGF in the hippocampus of Tg6799 mice at 5 and 10 months of age. In addition, VPA decreased escape latencies of Tg6799 mice at 5 and 10 months of age in Morris water maze assessment. Taken together, HDAC inhibition is a promising therapeutic target for AD and it needs to be considered in an age-dependent and/or stage-dependent manner.

AB  - Abstract
In seeking evidence for the presence and characteristic range of coupled time scale(s) of putative implicit turbulent attractors of dorsal frontal lobe magnetic fields, the recorded nonstationary, nonlinear MEG signals were non-orthogonally decomposed using Huang’s Empirical Mode Decomposition, EMD, (Huang and Attoh-Okine, 2005) into 16 Intrinsic Mode Functions, EMD → IMFi, i = 1…16. Measures known to be invariant in non-uniformly hyperbolic (turbulent) dynamical systems, topological entropy, hT, metric entropy, hM, non-uniform entropy, hU and power spectral scaling exponent, α, were imposed on each of the IMFi which evidenced most clearly an invariant temporal scale zone of IMFi, i = 6…11, for hT, which we have found to be the most robust of invariant measures of MEG’s magnetic field turbulent attractors (Mandell et al., 2011a,b; Mandell, 2013). The ergodic theory of dynamical systems (Walters, 1982; Pollicott and Yuri, 1998) allows the inference that an implicit attractor with consistently hT &gt; 0 will also evidence at least one positive Lyapounov exponent indicating the presence of a turbulent attractor with exponential separation of nearby initial conditions, exponential convergence of distant points and disordering, mixing, of orbital sequences. It appears that this approach permits the inference of the presence of chaotic, turbulent attractor and its characteristic time scales without the invocation of arbitrary n-dimensional embedding, phase space reconstructions or (inappropriate) orthogonal decompositions.

AB  - Abstract
In stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP/Izm), ischemia induces swelling of astrocytes, a process that subsequently leads to neuronal death. Following ischemic insult, arginine vasopressin (AVP) can induce edema and l-serine released by astrocytes supports the survival of neuronal cells. The purpose of this study was to examine whether AVP contributed to the regulation of l-serine production following ischemic stroke. Here, we used cultured astrocytes from SHRSP/Izm rats and Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY/Izm) to examine whether AVP changed the production of l-serine and/or altered gene expression levels of the neural amino acid transporter (Slc1a4), 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh) and serine racemase (SRR). Furthermore, using astrocytes from the congenic rat SHRpch1_18 strain having quantitative trait loci (QTL) of stroke, we examined expression of those genes under conditions of hypoxia and reoxygenation (H/R). The expression levels of ASCT1 protein, the genes described above and l-serine levels were determined by Western blotting (WB), RT-PCR, real-time quantitative RT-PCR and HPLC. AVP increased the production of l-serine and the expression of Slc1a4 in WKY/Izm and SHRSP/Izm astrocytes. The production of l-serine and the expression of Slc1a4 were lower in SHRSP/Izm than in WKY/Izm cells. This difference was not seen with Phgdh. In the SHRpch1_18 strain, the expression of Slc1a4 and Phgdh significantly decreased after H/R. AVP-mediated enhanced expression of ASCT1 was blocked by the addition of bumetanide. These results suggest that the AVP-mediated attenuated expression of ASCT1 in astrocytes is associated with reduced l-serine production in SHRSP/Izm astrocytes. We hypothesize that reduction of gene expression by AVP might be related to the induction of stroke in the SHRpch1_18 rat strain.

AB  - Abstract
Though sex differences in pain and analgesia are known, underlying mechanisms remain elusive. This study addresses the selective contribution of membrane estrogen receptors (mERs) and mER-initiated non-genomic signaling mechanisms in our previously reported estrogen-induced attenuation of α2-adrenoceptor-mediated antinociception. By selectively targeting spinal mERs in ovariectomized female rats using β-estradiol 6-(O-carboxy-methyl)oxime bovine serum albumin (E2BSA) (membrane impermeant estradiol analog), and ERα selective agonist 4,4′,4″-(4-propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl)trisphenol (PPT), ERβ selective agonist 2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile (DPN), G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor 30 (GPR30) agonist G1 and Gq-coupled mER (Gq-mER) agonist STX, we provide strong evidence that Gq-mER activation may solely contribute to suppressing clonidine (an α2-adrenoceptor agonist)-induced antinociception, using the nociceptive tail-flick test. Increased tail-flick latencies (TFLs) by intrathecal (i.t.) clonidine were not significantly altered by i.t. PPT, DPN, or G1. In contrast, E2BSA or STX rapidly and dose-dependently attenuated clonidine-induced increase in TFL. ICI 182,780, the ER antagonist, blocked this effect. Consistent with findings with the lack of effect of ERα and ERβ agonists that modulate receptor-regulated transcription, inhibition of de novo protein synthesis using anisomycin also failed to alter the effect of E2BSA or STX, arguing against a contribution of genomic mechanisms. Immunoblotting of spinal tissue revealed that mER activation increased levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) but not of protein kinase A (PKA) or C (PKC). In vivo inhibition of ERK with U0126 blocked the effect of STX and restored clonidine antinociception. Although estrogen-induced delayed genomic mechanisms may still exist, data presented here indicate that Gq-mER may solely mediate estradiol-induced attenuation of clonidine antinociception via a rapid, reversible, and ERK-dependent, non-genomic mechanism, suggesting that Gq-mER blockade might provide improved analgesia in females.

AB  - Abstract
We have examined the functional expression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in adult male rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells in culture by studying changes in pro-inflammatory cytokines and cyclooxygenase (COX)-dependent prostanoid production. In the mixed population of DRG neurons and glial cells, only DRG neurons expressed cell surface TLR4 along with MD-2 and CD14. This classical TLR4 signaling complex on DRG neurons responded to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with a TLR4-dependent and time-dependent increase in interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α mRNA expression which was entirely dependent on NF-κB activity. In contrast, after 2-h incubation with DRG cells, LPS-stimulated COX-2 was regulated by both NF-κB and transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with potential downstream activation of ERK1/2 and p38 kinase. In contrast to this evidence for myeloid differentiation primary response gene-88 (MyD88)-dependent signaling, no evidence was obtained for TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-ß (TRIF)-dependent signaling from TLR4 in DRG neurons. LPS surprisingly produced a time-dependent decrease in COX-1 protein which likely facilitates the COX-2-dependent production of prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin. Our study is the first to demonstrate the activation of TLR4-dependent production of prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin in DRG cell cultures. Our findings support the concept that the activation of TLR4 on primary sensory neurons by endogenous ligands may underlie neuropathic and inflammatory pain states.

AB  - Abstract
Apart from its role in regulating calcium there is growing evidence that vitamin D is a neuroactive steroid capable of regulating multiple pathways important for both brain development and mature brain function. Vitamin D induces its genomic effects through its nuclear receptor the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Although there is abundant evidence for this receptor’s presence in the mammalian brain from studies employing immunohistochemistry, Western blot or quantitative RNA studies there remains some dispute regarding the validity of these studies. In this study we provide unambiguous confirmation for the VDR in adult rodent brain using proteomic techniques. However Western blot experiments show that compared to more classic target organs such as the gut and kidney, VDR expression is quantitatively lower in the brain. In addition we have examined VDR subcellular distribution in the gut, kidney and brain from both embryonic and adult tissues. We show that in all embryonic tissues VDR distribution is mostly nuclear, however by adulthood it appears that at least in the gut and kidney, VDR presence in the plasma membrane is more prominent perhaps reflecting some change in VDR function with the maturation of these tissues. Finally the subcellular distribution of VDR in the embryo did not appear to be altered by vitamin D deficiency indicating that perhaps there are other mechanisms at play in vivo to stabilize this receptor in the absence of its ligand.

AB  - Abstract
Respiratory disturbances are a primary phenotype of the neurological disorder, Rett syndrome (RTT), caused by mutations in the X-linked gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Mouse models generated with null mutations in Mecp2 mimic respiratory abnormalities in RTT girls. Large deletions, however, are seen in only ∼10% of affected human individuals. Here we characterized respiration in heterozygous females from two mouse models that genetically mimic common RTT point mutations, a missense mutation T158A (Mecp2T158A/+) or a nonsense mutation R168X (Mecp2R168X/+). MeCP2 T158A shows decreased binding to methylated DNA, while MeCP2 R168X retains the capacity to bind methylated DNA but lacks the ability to recruit complexes required for transcriptional repression. We found that both Mecp2T158A/+ and Mecp2R168X/+ heterozygotes display augmented hypoxic ventilatory responses and depressed hypercapnic responses, compared to wild-type controls. Interestingly, the incidence of apnea was much greater in Mecp2R168X/+ heterozygotes, 189 per hour, than Mecp2T158A/+ heterozygotes, 41 per hour. These results demonstrate that different RTT mutations lead to distinct respiratory phenotypes, suggesting that characterization of the respiratory phenotype may reveal functional differences between MeCP2 mutations and provide insights into the pathophysiology of RTT.

AB  - Abstract
The present study examined the effects of social status on adult neurogenesis in an extreme cooperative breeder: the naked mole rat. These animals live in large colonies of up to 300 individuals, with a strict reproductive dominance hierarchy; one female and one to three males breed, and all other members are socially subordinate and reproductively suppressed. We examined the effects of social and gonadal cues on doublecortin (DCX; a marker for immature neurons) immunoreactivity in the dentate gyrus (DG), piriform cortex (PCx) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) by comparing dominant breeding animals to non-breeding subordinates from intact colonies. We also examined DCX expression in subordinate animals that had been removed from their colony and paired with an opposite- or same-sex conspecific for 6 months. Compared to subordinates, dominant breeders had significantly reduced DCX immunoreactivity in all brain areas, with BLA effects confined to females. By contrast, the effects of same- versus opposite-sex housing were region-specific. In the DG and PCx, more DCX immunoreactivity was observed for opposite- than same-sex-paired subordinates. Conversely, same-sex-paired females had more DCX immunoreactivity than opposite-sex-paired females in the BLA. Gonadectomy did not affect DCX expression in opposite-sex-paired animals, and no significant relationships between gonadal steroids and DCX immunoreactivity were detected, suggesting that group differences in neurogenesis are independent of gonadal hormones. The apparent lower neurogenic capacity displayed by breeders contrasts previous reports on neurogenesis and social rank, challenging the conventional view that subordination is stressful and impairs neurogenesis. Future work will clarify whether the present findings can be attributed to status-dependent differences in stress, behavioral plasticity, or life stage.

AB  - Abstract
The molecular and cellular mechanisms, which coordinate the critical stages of brain development to reach a normal structural organization with appropriate networks, are progressively being elucidated. Experimental and clinical studies provide evidence of the occurrence of developmental alterations induced by genetic or environmental factors leading to the formation of aberrant networks associated with learning disabilities. Moreover, evidence is accumulating that suggests that also late-onset neurological disorders, even Alzheimer’s disease, might be considered disorders of aberrant neural development with pathological changes that are set up at early stages of development before the appearance of the symptoms. Thus, evaluating proteins and pathways that are important in age-related neurodegeneration in the developing brain together with the characterization of mechanisms important during brain development with relevance to brain aging are of crucial importance. In the present review we focus on (1) aspects of neurogenesis with relevance to aging; (2) neurodegenerative disease (NDD)-associated proteins/pathways in the developing brain; and (3) further pathways of the developing or neurodegenerating brains that show commonalities. Elucidation of complex pathogenetic routes characterizing the earliest stage of the detrimental processes that result in pathological aging represents an essential first step toward a therapeutic intervention which is able to reverse these pathological processes and prevent the onset of the disease. Based on the shared features between pathways, we conclude that prevention of NDDs of the elderly might begin during the fetal and childhood life by providing the mothers and their children a healthy environment for the fetal and childhood development.

AB  - Abstract
Ibuprofen is a widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that reportedly reduces the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) development. The anti-inflammatory effect of ibuprofen occurred via inhibition of cyclooxygenases and anti-amyloidogenesis through modulation of γ-secretase. Presenilin 1 and 2 conditional double-knockout (cDKO) mice exhibited age-dependent memory impairment and forebrain degeneration without elevation of amyloid β deposition. Therefore, cDKO mice can be an ideal animal model on which to independently test the effects of ibuprofen anti-inflammatory properties on the prevention of AD. Three- and six-month-old cDKO mice were fed diet containing 375 ppm ibuprofen for six months. After multiple, well-validated behavioral tests, treatment with ibuprofen improved cognition-related behavioral performance, and drug efficacy was correlated with the timing of administration. Ibuprofen was more effective on six-month-old than on three-month-old cDKO mice. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the effects of ibuprofen on glial fibrillary acidic protein and CD68 expression levels were uneven in different brain regions of cDKO mice and that age also influenced such effects. Tau hyperphosphorylation and the cleavage of caspase-3 decreased after ibuprofen treatment, and this effect was more significant in the older than the younger group of mice, which was consistent with the results of behavioral tests.

AB  - AbstractBackground
Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase are transiently phosphorylated (activated) in the spinal cord and trigeminal nucleus by acute noxious stimuli. Acute stimulation of dental pulp induces short-lived ERK activation in trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc), and p38 inhibition attenuates short-term sensitization in Vc induced by acute pulpal stimulation. We have developed a model to study central changes following chronic inflammation of dental pulp that induces long-term sensitization. Here, we examine the effects of chronic inflammation and acute stimulation on the expression of phosphorylated ERK (pERK), phosphorylated p38 (pp38) and Fos in Vc.
Results
Chronic inflammation alone induced bilateral expression of pERK and pp38 in Vc, but did not induce Fos expression. Stimulation of both non-inflamed and inflamed pulps significantly increased pERK and pp38 bilaterally; expression was greatest in inflamed, stimulated animals, and was similar following 10-min and 60-min stimulation. Stimulation for 60 min, but not 10 min, induced Fos in ipsilateral Vc; Fos expression was significantly greater in inflamed, stimulated animals. pERK was present in both neurons and astrocytes; pp38 was present in neurons and other non-neuronal, non-astrocytic cell types.
Conclusions
This study provides the first demonstration that chronic inflammation of tooth pulp induces persistent bilateral activation of ERK and p38 within Vc, and that this activation is further increased by acute stimulation. This altered activity in intracellular signaling is likely to be linked to the sensitization that is seen in our animal model and in patients with pulpitis. Our data indicate that pERK and pp38 are more accurate markers of central change than Fos expression. In our model, localization of pERK and pp38 within specific cell types differs from that seen following acute stimulation. This may indicate specific roles for different cell types in the induction and maintenance of pulpitic and other types of pain.

AB  - Abstract
The gray short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica) is a nocturnal South American marsupial that has been gaining popularity as a laboratory animal. However, compared to traditional laboratory animals like rats, very little is known about its behavior, either in the wild or in a laboratory setting. Here we investigated the photic preference of the short-tailed opossum. Opossums were placed in a circular testing arena and allowed to move freely between dark (0 lux) and light (∼1.4, 40, or 400 lux) sides of the arena. In each of these conditions opossums spent significantly more time in the dark than in the illuminated side and a greater proportion of time in the dark than would be expected by chance. In the high-contrast (∼400 lux) illumination condition, the mean bout length (i.e., duration of one trip on the light or dark side) was significantly longer on the dark side than on the light side. When we examined the number of bouts greater than 30 and 60 s in duration, we found a significant difference between the light and dark sides in all light contrast conditions. These data indicate that the short-tailed opossum prefers the dark to the light, and can also detect very slight differences in light intensity. We conclude that although rats and opossums share many similar characteristics, including ecological niche, their divergent evolutionary heritage results in vastly different behavioral capabilities. Only by observing the behavioral capabilities and preferences of opossums will we be able to manipulate the experimental environment to best elicit and elucidate their behavior and alterations in behavior that can arise from experimental manipulations.

AB  - Abstract
Inflammation mediated by glial activation appears to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD). Glia maturation factor (GMF), a proinflammatory protein predominantly localized in the central nervous system was isolated, sequenced and cloned in our laboratory. We have previously demonstrated immunomodulatory and proinflammatory functions of GMF, but its involvement in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), active metabolite of classical parkinsonian toxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), inducing loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons has not been studied. Here we show that altered expression of GMF has direct consequences on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)- mediated production of inflammatory mediators by MPP+. We examined MPP+-induced DA neuronal loss in primary cultures of mouse mesencephalic neurons/glia obtained from GMF-deficient (GMF knockout (GMF-KO)) and GMF-containing wild-type (Wt) mice. We demonstrate that deficiency of GMF in GMF-KO neurons/glia led to decreased production of ROS and downregulation of NF-κB-mediated production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) as compared to Wt neurons/glia. Additionally, overexpression of GMF induced DA neurodegeneration, whereas GMF downregulation by GMF-specific shRNA protected DA neurons from MPP-induced toxicity. Subsequently, GMF deficiency ameliorates antioxidant balance, as evidenced by the decreased level of lipid peroxidation, less ROS production along with increased level of glutathione; and attenuated the DA neuronal loss via the downregulation of NF-κB-mediated inflammatory responses. In conclusion, our overall data indicate that GMF modulates oxidative stress and release of deleterious agents by MPP+ leading to loss of DA neurons. Our study provides new insights into the potential role of GMF and identifies targets for therapeutic interventions in neurodegenerative diseases.

Synapsins are a family of synaptic vesicle (SV)-associated phosphoproteins that have been identified in several vertebrates and invertebrates. We report here the cloning and expression of synapsin family genes in the zebrafish Danio rerio. We identified the complete coding sequence of synapsin 3, which is not present in the currently available genome, and characterized and annotated the synapsin gene family in the zebrafish D. rerio. By means of whole-mount in situ hybridization, we showed the spatiotemporal expression of synapsin genes at three different time points during early embryonic development: 20–24 h postfertilization (hpf), 30–33 hpf, and 3 days postfertilization (dpf). As very few data are available describing the expression of synapsin family genes during CNS development in vertebrate models, our results may help to achieve a better understanding of the complex functions of these molecules. Finally, new interesting evidence from our temporal gene expression studies suggests that synapsins have also maternal functions.

AB  - Abstract
Epilepsy is a highly common chronic neurological disorder. Although symptomatic treatment is available, 30–40% of epilepsy patients still remain resistant to anti-epileptic drugs. The primary identification and extensive characterization of the pathological substrates underlying epilepsy would facilitate the development of novel treatments, including disease-modifying and anti-epileptogenic therapies. A plethora of evidence points toward an undeniable role of brain inflammation in epileptogenesis. However, the exact role of this process remains unfortunately not clear. Non-invasive imaging of brain inflammation can promote our fundamental knowledge, which may lead to better insights into the role of brain inflammation in disease ontogenesis. Moreover, it will allow us to investigate whether the visualization of this process can serve as a validated biomarker for epilepsy. In turn, such can lead to major perspectives regarding the development and evaluation of anti-inflammatory treatments, and screening possibilities for patients at risk. Here, we first discuss the applications for imaging of the different brain inflammation constituents. Secondly, we review the available approaches for molecular imaging of brain inflammation in general and finally present the current research on the imaging of brain inflammation in patients and experimental models of epilepsy. The current imaging toolbox is limited by the range of neuroinflammatory targets, which can be visualized at present, and in addition, the often indirect approaches used. We believe that research in this field will further advance as highly specific ligands, and producible and practical imaging approaches will become available.

AB  - Abstract
The tetrameric kainate receptors can be assembled from a combination of five different subunit subtypes. While GluK1–3 subunits can form homomeric receptors, GluK4 and GluK5 require a heteromeric partner to assemble, traffic to the membrane surface, and produce a functional channel. Previous studies have shown that incorporation of a GluK4 or GluK5 subunit changes both receptor pharmacology and channel kinetics. We directly compared the functional characteristics of recombinant receptors containing either GluK4 or GluK5 in combination with the GluK1 or GluK2 subunit. In addition, we took advantage of mutations within the agonist binding sites of GluK1, GluK2, or GluK5 to isolate the response of the wild-type partner within the heteromeric receptor. Our results suggest that GluK1 and GluK2 differ primarily in their pharmacological properties, but that GluK4 and GluK5 have distinct functional characteristics. In particular, while binding of agonist to only the GluK5 subunit appears to activate the channel to a non-desensitizing state, binding to GluK4 does produce some desensitization. This suggests that GluK4 and GluK5 differ fundamentally in their contribution to receptor desensitization. In addition, mutation of the agonist binding site of GluK5 results in a heteromeric receptor with a glutamate sensitivity similar to homomeric GluK1 or GluK2 receptors, but which requires higher agonist concentrations to produce desensitization. This suggests that onset of desensitization in heteromeric receptors is determined more by the number of subunits bound to agonist than by the identity of those subunits. The distinct, concentration-dependent properties observed with heteromeric receptors in response to glutamate or kainate are consistent with a model in which either subunit can activate the channel, but in which occupancy of both subunits within a dimer is needed to allow desensitization of GluK2/K5 receptors.

AB  - Abstract
Previous work has shown that exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) during early development can alter sexual differentiation of the brain in rodents, although few studies have examined effects on areas of the brain associated with cognition. The current study examined if developmental BPA exposure alters the total number of neurons and glia in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in adulthood. Pregnant Long-Evans rats were orally exposed to 0, 4, 40, or 400-μg/kg BPA in corn oil throughout pregnancy. From postnatal days 1 to 9, pups were given daily oral doses of oil or BPA, at doses corresponding to those given during gestation. Brains were examined in adulthood, and the volume of layers 2/3 and layers 5/6 of the mPFC was parcellated. The density of neurons and glia in these layers was quantified stereologically with the optical disector, and density was multiplied by volume for each animal. Males exposed to 400-μg/kg BPA were found to have increased numbers of neurons and glia in layers 5/6. Although there were no significant effects of BPA in layers 2/3, the pattern of increased neuron number in males exposed to 400-μg/kg BPA was similar to that seen in layers 5/6. No effects of BPA were seen in females or in males exposed to the other doses of BPA. This study indicates that males are more susceptible to the long-lasting effects of BPA on anatomy of the mPFC, an area implicated in neurological disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is expressed at high levels in hippocampal neurons, although its function is unclear. We previously reported that LPL-deficient mice have learning and memory impairment and fewer synaptic vesicles in hippocampal neurons, but properties of synaptic activity in LPL-deficient neurons remain unexplored. In this study, we found reduced frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and readily releasable pool (RRP) size in LPL-deficient neurons, which led to presynaptic dysfunction and plasticity impairment without altering postsynaptic activity. We demonstrated that synaptic vesicle recycling, which is known to play an important role in maintaining the RRP size in active synapses, is impaired in LPL-deficient neurons. Moreover, lipid assay revealed deficient docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA) in the hippocampus of LPL-deficient mice; exogenous DHA or AA supplement partially restored synaptic vesicle recycling capability. These results suggest that impaired synaptic vesicle recycling results from deficient DHA and AA and contributes to the presynaptic dysfunction and plasticity impairment in LPL-deficient neurons.

AB  - Abstract
Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) is the most common drug-refractory focal epilepsy in adults. Although previous functional and morphological studies have revealed abnormalities in the brain networks of mTLE, the topological organization of the brain white matter (WM) networks in mTLE patients is still ambiguous. In this study, we constructed brain WM networks for 14 left mTLE patients and 22 age- and gender-matched normal controls using diffusion tensor tractography and estimated the alterations of network properties in the mTLE brain networks using graph theoretical analysis. We found that networks for both the mTLE patients and the controls exhibited prominent small-world properties, suggesting a balanced topology of integration and segregation. However, the brain WM networks of mTLE patients showed a significant increased characteristic path length but significant decreased global efficiency, which indicate a disruption in the organization of the brain WM networks in mTLE patients. Moreover, we found significant between-group differences in the nodal properties in several brain regions, such as the left superior temporal gyrus, left hippocampus, the right occipital and right temporal cortices. The robustness analysis showed that the results were likely to be consistent for the networks constructed with different definitions of node and edge weight. Taken together, our findings may suggest an adverse effect of epileptic seizures on the organization of large-scale brain WM networks in mTLE patients.

AB  - Abstract
The “plasticity hypothesis” proposes that major depression is caused by morphological and biochemical modifications in neurons and astrocytes and those beneficial pharmacological effects of selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors (SSRI) are at least partially associated with modifications of cellular communications between these cells. In this study we examined effects of the antidepressant fluoxetine on cultured astrocytes that were, in some cases, pretreated with dexamethasone, a cortisol analog known to trigger depressive disorder.

Primary rat astrocytes were purified and treated with dexamethasone and the SSRI fluoxetine in physiological concentrations so that both drugs did not affect cell viability. Expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and glia-derived-neurotrophic-factor (GDNF) were analyzed and monitored and cell viability, apoptosis, cluster formation, particle-removing capacity and cell mobility were also monitored.

Pre-studies without any drugs on mixed neuron-astrocyte co-cultures suggested that astrocytes interacted with neurons and other brain cells in vitro by actively assembling them into clusters. Treatment of purified astrocytes with dexamethasone significantly decreased their mobility compared to controls but had no effect on cluster formation. Dexamethasone-treated cells removed fewer extracellular particles derived from dead cells and cell debris. Both effects were abolished by simultaneous application of fluoxetine. Intracellular IL-2 increased, while GDNF amount expression was diminished following dexamethasone treatment. Simultaneous administration of fluoxetine reversed dexamethasone-triggered IL-2 elevation but had no effect on decreased GDNF concentration.

These results suggest that mobility and growth factor equilibrium of astrocytes are affected by dexamethasone and by fluoxetine and that fluoxetine could reverse some changes induced by dexamethasone.

AB  - Abstract
Interaction between pericytes and endothelial cells via platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B) signaling is critical for the development of the retinal microvasculature. The PDGF-B retention motif controls the spatial distribution range of the growth factor in the vicinity of its producing endothelial cells allowing its recognition by PDGF receptor beta-(PDGFR-β)-carrying pericytes; this promotes recruitment of pericytes to the vascular basement membrane. Impairment of the PDGF-B signaling mechanism causes development of vascular abnormalities, and in the retina this consequently leads to defects in the neurological circuitry. The vascular pathology in the pdgf-bret/ret (PDGF-B retention motif knockout) mouse retina has been previously reported; our study investigates the progressive neuronal defects and changes in the retinal morphology of this pericyte-deficient mouse model. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed retinal injuries to occur as early as postnatal day (P) 10 with substantial damage progressing from P15 and onward. Vascular abnormalities were apparent from P10, however, prominent neuronal defects were mostly observed from P15, beginning with the compromised integrity of the laminated retinal structure characterized by the presence of rosettes and focally distorted regions. Photoreceptor degeneration was observed by loss of both rod and cone cells, including the disassembly and altered structure of their synaptic terminals. Significant shortening of cone outer segments was observed from P10 and later stages; however, decrease in cone density was only observed at P28. Disorganization and dendrite remodeling of rod bipolar cells also added to the diminished neural and synaptic integrity. Moreover, in response to retinal injuries, Müller and microglial cells were observed to be in the reactive phenotype from P15 and onward. Such a sequence of events indicates that the pdgf-bret/ret mouse model displays a short time frame between P10 and P15, during which the retina shifts to a retinopathic phase by the development of prominently altered morphological features.

The total number of neurons and glial cells in the mediodorsal thalamic (MDT) nucleus of four aged females with Down syndrome (DS; mean age 69 years) was estimated and compared to six age- and sex-matched controls. The MDT nucleus was delineated on coronal sections, and cell numbers (large and small neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes) were estimated using the optical fractionator technique. The DS brains had an average of 3.41 × 106 total neurons in the MDT nucleus in contrast to 5.97 × 106 in the controls, with no overlap (2p = 0.004), affecting large (projecting) and small (local inhibitory) neurons nearly equally. In contrast, we observed no significant differences in either glial cell population. The cortical structures of the same four DS brains were previously estimated to be half the normal size of controls with a reduction in cell numbers whereas the basal ganglia were unaffected. As DS brains are affected by developmental delay, premature aging, and Alzheimer-like pathology, the finite cause of the reduced number of cells in MDT nucleus cannot be determined; however, these findings provide stereological evidence for a local reduction in neuron numbers in the MDT nucleus, which could affect the cognitive capacity of patients with DS.

AB  - Abstract
Previously we have demonstrated that intraventricular injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) results in increased proliferation and de-differentiation of rat cortical astrocytes into progenitor-like cells 4 days after lesion (Wachter et al., 2010).

To find out if these cells express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in the catecholamine synthesis pathway, we performed immunohistochemistry in the rat cortex following intraventricular injection of 6-OHDA. Four days after injection we demonstrated a strong emergence of TH-positive (TH+) somata in the cortices of 6-OHDA-lesioned animals. The number of TH+ cells in the cortex of 6-OHDA-lesioned animals was 15 times higher than in sham-operated animals, where virtually no TH+ somata occurred. Combining TH immunohistochemistry with classical Nissl stain yielded complete congruency, and ∼45% of the TH+ cells co-expressed calretinin, which indicates an interneuron affiliation. There was no co-staining of TH with other interneuron markers or with glial markers such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) or the neural stem/progenitor marker Nestin, nor could we find co-localization with the proliferation marker Ki67. However, we found a co-localization of TH with glial progenitor cell markers (Sox2 and S100β) and with polysialylated-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), which has been shown to be expressed in immature, but not recently generated cortical neurons.

Taken together, this study seems to confirm our previous findings with respect to a 6-OHDA-induced expression of neuronal precursor markers in cells of the rat cortex, although the TH+ cells found in this study are not identical with the potentially de-differentiated astrocytes described recently (Wachter et al., 2010).

The detection of cortical cells expressing the catecholaminergic key enzyme TH might indicate a possible compensatory role of these cells in a dopamine-(DA)-depleted system. Future studies are needed to determine whether the TH+ cells are capable of DA synthesis to confirm this hypothesis.

AB  - Abstract
Age-associated memory impairments may result as a consequence of neuroinflammatory induction of intracellular calcium (Ca+2) dysregulation. Altered L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel (L-VDCC) and ryanodine receptor (RyR) activity may underlie age-associated learning and memory impairments. Various neuroinflammatory markers are associated with increased activity of both L-VDCCs and RyRs, and increased neuroinflammation is associated with normal aging. In vitro, pharmacological blockade of L-VDCCs and RyRs has been shown to be anti-inflammatory. Here, we examined whether pharmacological blockade of L-VDCCs or RyRs with the drugs nimodipine and dantrolene, respectively, could improve spatial memory and reduce age-associated increases in microglia activation. Dantrolene and nimodipine differentially attenuated age-associated spatial memory deficits but were not anti-inflammatory in vivo. Furthermore, RyR gene expression was inversely correlated with spatial memory, highlighting the central role of Ca+2 dysregulation in age-associated memory deficits.

AB  - Abstract
Human adult dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) are self-renewing stem cells that originate from the neural crest during development and remain within the dental pulp niche through adulthood. Due to their multi-lineage differentiation potential and their relative ease of access they represent an exciting alternative for autologous stem cell-based therapies in neurodegenerative diseases. In animal models, DPSCs transplanted into the brain differentiate into functional neurons or astrocytes in response to local environmental cues that appear to influence the fate of the surviving cells. Here we tested the hypothesis that DPSCs might be able to respond to factors present in the retina enabling the regenerative potential of these cells. We evaluated the response of DPSCs to conditioned media from organotypic explants from control and chemically damaged rat retinas. To evaluate cell differentiation, we analyzed the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), early neuronal and retinal markers (polysialic acid-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM); Pax6; Ascl1; NeuroD1) and the late photoreceptor marker rhodopsin, by immunofluorescence and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Exposure of DPSC cultures to conditioned media from control retinas induced a 39% reduction on the number of DPSCs that expressed GFAP; the expression of Pax6, Ascl1, PSA-NCAM or NeuroD1 was undetectable or did not change significantly. Expression of rhodopsin was not detectable in control or after exposure of the cultures with retinal conditioned media. By contrast, 44% of DPSCs exposed to conditioned media from damaged retinas were immunopositive to this protein. This response could not be reproduced when conditioned media from Müller-enriched primary cultures was used. Finally, quantitative RT-PCR was performed to compare the relative expression of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in DPSC co-cultured with retinal organotypic explants, where BDNF mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in retinal-exposed cultures. Our data demonstrate that DPSC cultures respond to cues from the rat retina and differentiate to express retinal neuronal markers.

Over recent years evidence from animal studies strongly suggests that a decrease in local inhibitory signaling is necessary for synaptic plasticity to occur. However, the role of GABAergic modulation in human motor plasticity is less well understood. Here, we summarize the techniques available to quantify GABA in humans, before reviewing the existing evidence for the role of inhibitory signaling in human motor plasticity. We discuss a number of important outstanding questions that remain before the role of GABAergic modulation in long-term plasticity in humans, such as that underpinning recovery after stroke, can be established.

AB  - Abstract
Birdsong offers a unique model system to understand how a developing brain – once given a set of purely acoustic targets – teaches itself the vocal-tract gestures necessary to imitate those sounds. Like human infants, to juvenile male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) falls the burden of initiating the vocal-motor learning of adult sounds. In both species, adult caregivers provide only a set of sounds to be imitated, with little or no information about the vocal-tract gestures used to produce the sounds. Here, we focus on the central control of birdsong and review the recent discovery that zebra finch song is under dual premotor control. Distinct forebrain pathways for structured (theme) and unstructured (variation) singing not only raise new questions about mechanisms of sensory-motor integration, but also provide a fascinating new research opportunity. A cortical locus for a motor memory of the learned song is now firmly established, meaning that anatomical, physiological, and computational approaches are poised to reveal the neural mechanisms used by the brain to compose the songs of birds.

We investigated the involvement of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the modulation of cholecystokinin-4 (CCK-4)-evoked anxiety and depression. Adult male mice were injected with vehicle, CCK-4, NPY, NPY Y1 receptor agonist [Leu31, Pro34]-NPY or antagonist BIBP3226, via intracerebroventricular route, and subjected to social interaction or forced swim test (FST) for the evaluation of anxiety- and depression-like phenotypes, respectively. To assess the interactions between the two systems, if any, NPYergic agents were administered prior to CCK-4 and the animals were subjected to these behavioral tests. Treatment with CCK-4 or BIBP3226 dose-dependently reduced social interaction time, while NPY or [Leu31, Pro34]-NPY produced opposite effect. CCK-4 treatment increased immobility time in FST. This effect was reversed by NPY and [Leu31, Pro34]-NPY, although BIBP3226 per se did not alter the immobility time. In a combination study, the anxiogenic or depressive effects of CCK-4 were attenuated by NPY or [Leu31, Pro34]-NPY and potentiated by BIBP3226. The brains of CCK-4 treated rats were processed for NPY immunohistochemistry. Following CCK-4 treatment, the nucleus accumbens shell (AcbSh), ventral part of lateral division of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BSTLV), hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and locus coeruleus showed a reduction in NPY-immunoreactive fibers. Population of NPY-immunopositive cells was also decreased in the AcbSh, BSTLV, prefrontal cortex and hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC). However, NPY-immunoreaction in the fibers of the ARC and cells of the central nucleus of amygdala was unchanged. We conclude that, inhibition of NPY signaling in the brain by CCK-4 might be causal to anxiety- and depression-like behaviors.

AB  - Abstract
Over human leg muscles, three motor responses (MR) can commonly be elicited, namely short-latency reflex (SLR), medium-latency reflex (MLR), and long-latency reflex (LLR). The MLR is less well understood than SLR and LLR. As the response to subsequent stimuli may be used to characterize central influences of an MR, we were interested, whether the MLR differs from SLR and LLR with respect to its habituation and facilitation behavior. MR were examined over the anterior tibial (TA) muscle at different contraction levels after electrical single or train stimuli (time intervals of 3 ms) over the ipsilateral sural nerve. Furthermore, MR were selectively averaged after each of four subsequent stimuli (1 Hz, 0.4 Hz, trains-of-3). After single stimuli, the peak latency values were 46.2 ± 2.3 ms, 88.0 ± 5.8 ms (MLR), and 131.7 ± 22.2 ms (LLR). All three MR gained similarly strong and significantly in amplitude when up to 10 kg of weight was loaded compared with no weight load. After train stimuli, the LLR but not SLR and MLR gained significantly in amplitude as compared with single stimuli. Different to SLR and LLR, the MLR showed significant habituation behavior at a stimulus repetition rate of 1 Hz but not of 0.4 Hz. Thus, inhibitory interneurons seem to be involved in the MLR pathway.

AB  - Abstract
AMPA receptor GluA2 subunits are strongly implicated in cognition, and prior work suggests that these subunits may be regulated by atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) isoforms. The present study assessed whether hippocampal and cortical AMPA receptor GluA2 subunit regulation may be an underlying factor in known age-related differences to cognitive-impairing doses of ethanol, and if aPKC isoforms modulate such responses. Hippocampal AMPA receptor GluA2 subunit, protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ), and PKCι/λ expression were elevated during adolescence compared to adults. 1 h following a low-dose (1.0-g/kg) ethanol exposure, hippocampal AMPA receptor GluA2 subunit serine 880 phosphorylation was decreased in adolescents, but was increased in adults. Age-dependent changes in GluA2 subunit phosphorylation were paralleled by alterations in aPKC isoforms, and zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) administration prevented ethanol-induced increases in both in adults. Ethanol-induced changes in GluA2 subunit phosphorylation were associated with delayed regulation in synaptosomal GluA2 subunit expression 24 h later. A higher ethanol dose (3.5-g/kg) failed to elicit changes in most measures in the hippocampus at either age. Similar to the hippocampus, analysis of cerebral cortical tissue also revealed age-related declines. However, no demonstrable effects were found following a low-dose ethanol exposure at either age. High-dose ethanol exposure reduced adolescent GluA2 subunit phosphorylation and aPKC isoform expression that were again accompanied by delayed reductions in synaptosomal GluA2 subunit expression. Together, these results suggest that GluA2-containing AMPA receptor modulation by aPKC isoforms is age-, region- and dose-dependently regulated, and may potentially be involved in developmentally regulated ethanol-induced cognitive impairment and other ethanol behaviors.

AB  - Abstract
Exposure to microgravity has been shown to result in damaging alterations to skeletal muscle, bones, and inner organs. In this study, we investigated the effects of microgravity by using a hindlimb unloading model (HUM) in mice. The characteristics of the lumbar spinal cords of HUM mice 30 days after hindlimb unloading were examined. Morphometric analysis showed reductions of the total area, gray matter, and white matter by 17%, 20%, and 12%, respectively. Myelinated fibers in the white matter showed prominent myelin destruction. Analysis of the number of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP+)/S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B−), GFAP+/S100B+, and GFAP−/S100B+ astrocytes in the ventral horn (VH), central channel area (CC), dorsal root entry zone (DREZ), main corticospinal tract (CST), and ventral funiculi (VF) showed that the number of GFAP+/S100B− astrocytes was increased in the DREZ and CST of HUM mice. Additionally, GFAP+/S100B+ cell numbers were significantly decreased in the VH and CST but did not differ in the CC or DREZ of HUM mice, as compared with the control. The numbers of GFAP−/S100B+ cells were significantly reduced only in the VH of HUM mice. Moreover, the number of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1+) microglia cells was significantly increased in the CC and DREZ of HUM mice. In control mice, homeobox protein HoxB8 (HoxB8+) cells were found only in the CC; in contrast, HoxB8+ cells were observed in all studied areas in HUM mice, with the greatest number found in the CC. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of the lumbar spinal cords of HUM mice showed decreased expression of genes encoding myelin, extracellular matrix, cytoskeleton, and cell adhesion proteins. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed reductions in the expression of mpz, pmp2, pmp22, and prx genes, which are involved in myelination, as well as decreases in the levels of genes encoding extracellular matrix molecules, including glycoproteins (matrix gla protein (MGP), osteoglycin (OGN), microfibrillar associated protein 5 (MFAP), and collagen, type IV, alpha 1 (COL4A)), proteoglycans (perlecan (heparan sulfate proteoglycan) (HSPG)), and metalloproteinases (lysyl oxidase (LOX)). Thus, our results showed that hindlimb unloading caused decreases in gray and white matter areas, changes in gene expression, alterations in myelination, and phenotypic modifications in glial cells in the lumbar spinal cords of mice.

AB  - AbstractBackground
Isoflurane postconditioning induces neuroprotection in neonatal rats after hypoxia/ischemia (HI). Here, we evaluated the possible role of inhibiting the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) in isoflurane postconditioning-improved long-term neurological outcome after brain HI.
Methods
Seven-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 360) were randomly divided into eight groups (n = 45 in each). They underwent or did not undergo left common carotid arterial ligation followed by exposure to 8% oxygen for 2 h at 37 °C (brain HI). The mPTP opener atractyloside or inhibitor cyclosporin A was injected into the lateral cerebral ventricle. The weight ratio and neuronal density ratio in the ventral posteromedial thalamic nucleus and hippocampal CA3 area of left to right cerebral hemispheres were evaluated at 7 or 35 days after brain HI. The changes of mitochondrial optical density (ΔOD540 of mPTP) and the performance in Morris water maze were assessed.
Results
Compared with the control (sham group), brain HI decreased the weight ratio and neuronal density ratio in the ventral posteromedial thalamic nucleus and hippocampal CA3 area (P &lt; 0.05). Brain HI also impaired the performance of rats in the Morris water maze and increased the ΔOD540. These effects of brain HI were reduced by isoflurane postconditioning and cyclosporin A. The improvement induced by isoflurane postconditioning was attenuated by atractyloside.
Conclusion
Isoflurane postconditioning improved long-term neurological functions after brain HI in neonatal rats. Inhibiting the opening of the mPTP may contribute to this protection.

AB  - Abstract
The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a brain region processing salient sensory and emotional information, controlling motivated behaviors, natural or drug-related reward, reward-related learning, mood, and participating in their associated psychopathologies. Mostly studied for its dopamine neurons, the VTA also includes functionally important GABA and glutamate cell populations. Behavioral evidence supports the presence of functional differences between the anterior VTA (aVTA) and the posterior VTA (pVTA), which is the topic of this review. This antero-posterior heterogeneity concerns locomotor activity, conditioned place preference and intracranial self-administration, and can be seen in response to ethanol, acetaldehyde, salsolinol, opioids including morphine, cholinergic agonists including nicotine, cocaine, cannabinoids and after local manipulation of GABA and serotonin receptors. It has also been observed after viral-mediated manipulation of GluR1, phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) expression, with impact on reward and aversion-related responses, on anxiety and depression-related behaviors and on pain sensitivity. In this review, the substrates potentially underlying these aVTA/pVTA differences are discussed, including the VTA sub-nuclei and the heterogeneity in connectivity, cell types and molecular characteristics. We also review the role of the tail of the VTA (tVTA), or rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), which may also participate to the observed antero-posterior heterogeneity of the VTA. This region, partly located within the pVTA, is an inhibitory control center for dopamine activity. It controls VTA and substantia nigra dopamine cells, thus exerting a major influence on basal ganglia functions. This review highlights the need for a more comprehensive analysis of VTA heterogeneity.

AB  - Abstract
It has been acknowledged that oxidative stress, resulting in the apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons, is a key mechanism in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Puerarin, extracted from the root of pueraria lobata, has been clinically used for ischemic heart disease and cerebrovascular diseases as an oxygen free radical scavenger. In this study, we aimed to explore the effect of puerarin on dopaminergic cell degeneration in vitro and in vivo and its possible underlying mechanisms. In SH-SY5Y cells, the reduction of cell viability, apoptosis rate and average DCFH-DA fluorescence intensity of puerarin-treated (0, 10, 50, 100 and 150 μM) cells were significantly lower than control group. In rotenone-based rodent models, puerarin treatment for 7 days ameliorated apomorphine-induced rotations significantly in Pue-50 and Pue-100 group by 45.65% and 53.06% in the first week, by 44.60% and 48.45% in the second week. Moreover, compared to control group, puerarin increased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in the substantia nigra by 85.52% and 84.26% in Pue-50 group and Pue-100 group, and upregulated the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) by 41.24% in Pue-50 group and 35.20% in Pue-100 group, and decreased ubiquitin expression by 47.55% in Pue-50 group and 69.15% in Pue-100 group. These data indicated that puerarin alleviated the oxidative stress and apoptosis in a PD cellular model, protected the dopaminergic neurons against rotenone toxicity and decreased the abnormal protein overexpressing in PD animal models. These findings suggest that puerarin may develop into a neuroprotective alternative for patients with PD.

AB  - Abstract
Binding of bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) to toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) triggers an innate immunoresponse associated with pain and inflammation. The expression, and to a greater extent the regulation of TLR4 and its auxiliary proteins (myeloid differentiation protein 1 (MD1), myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD2) and cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14)), are both poorly understood in trigeminal and nodose neurons.

We used a combination of Western blotting, semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), pharmacological manipulation and immunohistochemistry. The expression pattern and regulation by LPS and trophic factors of TLR4/MD2/CD14 and radioprotective protein of 105 kDa (RP105)/MD1 were determined in neonatal trigeminal and nodose mice neurons. We found that all these proteins were expressed in both trigeminal and nodose neurons. The trophic factors Artemin and nerve growth factor (NGF) up-regulated MD2 and RP105 mRNA levels in trigeminal neurons. In nodose neurons the trophic factors brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) up-regulated MD1 and RP105 mRNA levels. Also we observed that in both neuronal types LPS acutely (within 20 min) down-regulated CD14 and MD2 mRNAs. In addition, LPS increased significantly the proportion of trigeminal and nodose neurons expressing nociceptin/orphanin FQ in culture probably acting via TLR4/MD2.

Although the exact mechanisms underlying the regulation by trophic factors and LPS require further elucidation, the findings of this study indicate that LPS acts through its archetypical receptor in trigeminal and nodose neurons.

AB  - Abstract
Retinoic acid (RA) is required for development and homeostasis of the normal mammalian brain and may play a role in the initiation and progression of malignant brain tumors, such as the glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and the gliosarcoma (Gsarc). The subpopulation of stem-like glioma cells (SLGCs) was shown to resist standard glioma radio-/chemotherapy and to propagate tumor regrowth. We used phenotypically distinct, self-renewing SLGC lines from six human GBMs, two Gsarcs, and two subcloned SLGC derivatives in order to investigate their responsiveness to all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) and to identify the RA-receptor (RAR) isotypes involved. In general, atRA exerted a pro-proliferative and pro-survival effect on SLGCs, though the efficacy was distinct. By means of RAR isotype-selective retinoids we disclosed that these effects were mediated by RARα and RARγ, except for one SLGC line, in which the pro-proliferative signal was induced by the RARβ-selective retinoid. Only one GBM-derived cell line (T1338) and a subpopulation of another (T1389) displayed neural differentiation in response to atRA. Differentiation of T1338 was induced by RARα and RARγ isotype-selective retinoids, associated with down-regulation of Sox2, and the failure to induce orthotopic tumors in the brains of SCID mice. The differential responsiveness of the SLGC lines appeared unrelated to the expression of RARβ, as (i) atRA augmented RAR isotype mRNA expression and particularly rarβ mRNA in all SLGC lines, (ii) rarβ promoter hypomethylation in the SLGC lines was not related to differentiation and (iii) the induction of T1338 differentiation was by RARα- and RARγ-selective ligands.

The recent decade testified a tremendous increase in our knowledge on how cell-type-specific microcircuits process sensory information in the neocortex and on how such circuitry reacts to manipulations of the sensory environment. Experience-dependent plasticity has now been investigated with techniques endowed with cell resolution during both postnatal development and in adult animals. This review recapitulates the main recent findings in the field using mainly the primary visual cortex as a model system to highlight the more important questions and physiological principles (such as the role of non-competitive mechanisms, the role of inhibition in excitatory cell plasticity, the functional importance of spine and axonal plasticity on a microscale level). I will also discuss on which scientific problems the debate and controversies are more pronounced. New technologies that allow to perturbate cell-type-specific subcircuits will certainly shine new light in the years to come at least on some of the still open questions.

AB  - Abstract
Inflammatory mechanisms were recently identified as contributors to delayed neuronal damage after ischemic stroke. However, therapeutic strategies are still lacking, probably related to the outstanding standardization on inflammatory cell recruitment emerging from predominantly artificial stroke models, and the uncertainty on functional properties of distinct subpopulations. Using a rodent model of stroke that closely reflects human embolic ischemia, this study was focused on the local recruitment of immunoreactive cells as well as their functional and regional characterization. Wistar rats underwent thromboembolic middle cerebral artery occlusion, followed by intravenous injection of the blood–brain barrier permeability marker fluorescein-conjugated albumin at 24 h. One hour later, brain tissue was subjected to multi-parameter flow cytometry and Pappenheim staining to characterize cells invaded into the ischemia-affected hemisphere, compared to the contralateral side. Immunofluorescence labeling was applied to explore the distribution patterns of recruited cells and their spatial relationships with the vasculature. One day after ischemia onset, a 6.12-fold increase of neutrophils and a 5.43-fold increase of monocytes/macrophages was found in affected hemispheres, while these cells exhibited enhanced major histocompatibility complex class II expression and allocation with vessels exhibiting impaired blood–brain barrier integrity. Microglia remained numerically unaltered in ischemic hemispheres, but shifted to an activated phenotype indicated by CD45/CD86 expression and morphological changes toward an ameboid appearance in the bordering zone. Ischemia caused an increase of lymphoid cells in close vicinity to the affected vasculature, while further analyses allowed separation into natural killer cells, natural killer T cells, T cells (added by an unconventional CD11b+/CD3+ population) and two subpopulations of B cells. Taken together, our study provides novel data on the local inflammatory response to experimental thromboembolic stroke. As concomitantly present neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages and lymphoid cells in the early stage after ischemia induction correspond to changes seen in human stroke, future stroke research should preferably use animal models with relevance for clinical translation.

AB  - Abstract
In time processing, the role of different cortical areas is still under investigation. Event-related potentials (ERPs) represent valuable indices of neural timing mechanisms in the millisecond-to-second domain. We used an interference approach by repetitive TMS (rTMS) on ERPs and behavioral performance to investigate the role of different cortical areas in processing basic temporal information. Ten healthy volunteers were requested to decide whether time intervals between two tones (S1–S2, probe interval) were shorter (800 ms), equal to, or longer (1200 ms) than a previously listened 1000-ms interval (target interval) and press different buttons accordingly. This task was performed at the baseline and immediately after a 15-min-long train of 1-Hz rTMS delivered over the supplementary motor area, right posterior parietal cortex, right superior temporal gyrus, or an occipital control area. Task accuracy, reaction time, and ERPs during (contingent negative variation, CNV) and after the presentation of probe intervals were analyzed. At the baseline, CNV amplitude was modulated by the duration of the probe interval. RTMS had no significant effect on behavioral or ERP measures. These preliminary data suggest that stimulated cortical areas are less crucially involved than other brain regions (e.g. subcortical structures) in the explicit discrimination of auditory time intervals in the range of hundreds of milliseconds.

AB  - Abstract
Neuropathy target esterase (NTE) is a protein involved in the development of a polyneuropathy caused by exposure to certain organophosphorus compounds. In vivo and in vitro studies have also associated NTE with embryonic development since NTE null mice embryos are non-viable, and silencing the NTE-codifying gene (Pnpla6) in mouse embryonic stem cells strongly alters the differentiation of vascular and nervous systems. In this paper, human embryonal carcinoma stem cells human-derived NTera2/D1 (hNT2) are used as an in vitro neurodifferentiation model to determine whether PNPLA6 silencing is able to alter the differentiation process. In control cultures, PNPLA6 mRNA levels increased in parallel with other neuroectodermal markers during neurodifferentiation. PNPLA6 silencing with specific interference RNA reached a 97% decrease in gene expression 3 days after transfection and with a maximum reduction in NTE enzymatic activity (50%), observed on day 4. Silencing PNPLA6 showed an 80% decrease in quantifiable neuronal cells after 13 days in vitro (DIV) compared to controls and absence of different neuronal markers after 66 DIV. Microarray data analysis of the PNPLA6-silenced cells showed alterations in several developmental processes, mainly neurogenesis and epithelium tube morphogenesis. PNPLA6 silencing also led to a reduction in electrical activity and an altered neuronal phenotype. This work is the first proof supporting the hypothesis that NTE plays a role in human early neurodevelopment using a human cell differentiation model.

AB  - Abstract
CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-beta (C/EBP-beta) is a transcription factor that belongs to the C/EBP family. To understand the role of C/EBP-beta in the peripheral nervous system, we investigated the expression of C/EBP-beta in the dorsal root ganglion. C/EBP-beta was weakly detected in nuclei of naive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Spinal nerve ligation increased the expression of C/EBP-beta in L4 and L5 DRG neurons. Treatment with anti-TNF-alpha prevented SNL-induced pain hypersensitivity and C/EBP-beta expression in the DRG. Injection of TNF-alpha into the sciatic nerve produced transient pain hypersensitivity and induction of C/EBP-beta expression in the DRG.

These results demonstrate that C/EBP-beta is activated in the DRG neurons by a TNF-alpha-dependent manner and might be involved in the activation of primary afferent neurons after nerve injury.

AB  - Abstract
Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) has been identified in primary sensory neurons, both in vivo and in vitro, but is reportedly absent from satellite glial cells (SGCs). Herein we reveal that, in rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG), SGCs do express TLR4 but this expression is inhibited by direct contact with neurons. Thus, TLR4 mRNA and protein is strongly up-regulated in isolated DRG glial cells in the absence of neurons. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increased cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) mRNA expression with greater efficacy in DRG glial cell cultures than in mixed DRG cell cultures containing TLR4-positive neurons. Using an insert co-culture system, we have shown that neuronal inhibition of glial cell TLR4 is likely to be dependent on cell–cell contact rather than diffusible factors from neurons. LPS stimulated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production from DRG glial cells in a TLR4- and COX-2-dependent manner. In addition, exogenous PGE2 potentiated LPS-stimulated COX-2 mRNA while inhibiting TNFα mRNA expression by DRG cells, suggestive of a complex regulatory system to control inflammation within the DRG. In addition to LPS, conditioned medium from heat-shocked DRG neurons also increased COX-2 mRNA expression in DRG glial cells in a partially TLR4-dependent manner. We therefore hypothesize that neuronal suppression of glial TLR4 activity is a protective mechanism to prevent uncontrolled inflammation within the DRG. Under conditions where DRG neuronal viability is compromised, DRG glial cells become responsive to PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) and DAMPs (danger-associated molecular patterns) and generate a range of classical inflammatory responses.

AB  - Abstract
Hypofunction of the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAr) has been considered to play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. In rodent electroencephalogram (EEG) studies, non-competitive NMDAr antagonists have been reported to produce aberrant basal gamma band oscillation (GBO), as observed in schizophrenia. Aberrations in GBO power have attracted attention as a translational biomarker for the development of novel antipsychotic drugs. However, the neuronal mechanisms as well as the pharmacological significance of NMDAr antagonist-induced aberrant GBO power have not been fully investigated. In the present study, to address the above questions, we examined the pharmacological properties of MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg)-increased basal GBO power in rat cortical EEG. Riluzole (3–10 mg/kg), a glutamate release inhibitor, reduced the MK-801-increased basal GBO power. In contrast, L-838,417 (1–3 mg/kg), an α2/3/5 subunit-selective GABAA receptor-positive allosteric modulator, enhanced the GBO increase. Antipsychotics such as haloperidol (0.05–0.3 mg/kg) and clozapine (1–10 mg/kg) dose-dependently attenuated the MK-801-increased GBO power. Likewise, LY379268 (0.3–3 mg/kg), an metabotropic glutamate 2/3 receptor (mGlu2/3 receptor) agonist, reduced the GBO increase in a dose-dependent manner, which was antagonized by an mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist LY341495. These results suggest that an increase in cortical GBO power induced by NMDAr hypofunction can be attributed to the aberrant activities of both excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons in local circuits. The aberrant cortical GBO power reflecting cortical network dysfunction observed in schizophrenia might be a useful biomarker for the discovery of novel antipsychotic drugs.

AB  - Abstract
The gate control theory proposed that the nociceptive sensory information transmitted to the brain relies on an interplay between the inputs from nociceptive and non-nociceptive primary afferent fibers. Both inputs are normally under strong inhibitory control in the spinal cord. Under healthy conditions, presynaptic inhibition activated by non-nociceptive fibers modulates the afferent input from nociceptive fibers onto spinal cord neurons, while postsynaptic inhibition controls the excitability of dorsal horn neurons, and silences the non-nociceptive information flow to nociceptive-specific (NS) projection neurons. However, under pathological conditions, this spinal inhibition may be altered and lead to chronic pain. This review summarizes our knowledge of presynaptic inhibition in pain control, with particular focus on how its alteration after nerve or tissue injury contributes to neuropathic or inflammatory pain syndromes, respectively.

AB  - Abstract
Objective: Accumulation of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) by prolyl-4-hydroxylase inhibitors (PHI) has been suggested to induce neuroprotection in the ischemic rodent brain. We aimed to investigate in vivo effects of a novel PHI on HIF-regulated neurotrophic and pro-apoptotic factors in the developing normoxic and hypoxic mouse brain. Methods: Neonatal mice (P7) were treated with PHI FG-4497 (30–100 mg/kg, i.p.) followed by exposure to systemic hypoxia (8% O2, 6 h) 4 h later. Cerebral expression of HIFα-subunits, specific neurotrophic and vasoactive target genes (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), adrenomedullin (ADM), erythropoietin (EPO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)) as well as pro-apoptotic (BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa protein-interacting protein 3 gene (BNIP3), immediate early response 3 (IER3)) and migratory factors (chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1)) was determined (quantitative real-time (RT)., Western blot analysis) in comparison to controls. Apoptotic cell death was analyzed by terminal desoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) and cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) staining. Results: Under normoxic conditions, FG-4497 treatment significantly induced the accumulation of both HIF-1α and HIF-2α isoforms in developing mouse brain. In addition, there was a significant up-regulation of HIF target genes (VEGF, ADM, EPO, CXCR4, p &lt; 0.01) with FG-4497 treatment compared to controls supporting functional activation of the HIF proteins. Under hypoxia, differential target gene activation was observed in the developing brain including additive effects of FG-4497 and hypoxia on mRNA expression of VEGF and ADM as well as a dose-dependent down-regulation of iNOS. BNIP3 but not IER3 mRNA levels significantly increased in hypoxic brains pre-treated with high-dose FG-4497 compared to controls. Of special interest, FG-4497 treatment significantly diminished apoptotic cell death, quantified by TUNEL and CC3-positive cells, in hypoxic developing brains compared to controls. Conclusions: PHI treatment modulates neurotrophic factors known to be crucially involved in hypoxia-induced cerebral adaptive mechanisms as well as early brain maturation. Pre-treatment with FG-4497 seems to protect the developing brain from hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Present observations provide basic information for further evaluation of neuroprotective properties of PHI treatment in hypoxic injury of the developing brain. However, potential effects on maturational processes need special attention in experimental research targeting HIF-dependent neuroprotective interventions during the very early stage of brain development.

AB  - Abstract
Increasing evidence indicates that Huntington’s disease (HD) produces postural control impairments even before the clinical diagnosis. It has been suggested that postural disorders of HD patients are explained by deficits in the processing and integration of sensory information, but this hypothesis has been under-explored. In the present study, we evaluated the amplitude of the center of pressure (COP) displacement during maximum leaning in four directions (forward, backward, rightward and leftward) and under three sensory conditions (eyes open, eyes closed and eyes closed standing on foam). We assessed the stability limits in 20 individuals with a positive HD genetic test (12 premanifests; eight manifests HD) and 15 healthy controls. The COP displacements were analyzed during the first and second phases of maintenance of the maximum leaning position. Manifest HD patients showed significantly greater COP ranges than healthy controls in both learning phases and all sensory conditions, but the greatest deterioration of their performance was found in the foam condition. In contrast, premanifest HD patients displayed larger COP ranges than controls only during the second phase of maximum learning, especially in the foam condition. Furthermore, both HD groups had significantly smaller limits of stability than healthy subjects during the second phase of maximum learning. However, their ability to maintain the maximum leaning position was degraded during both learning phases. Together, these findings demonstrate that HD reduces the limits of stability even before the clinical disease onset. Furthermore, our results indicate that dynamic postural tasks with high demand for sensorimotor integration and especially the use of proprioception are highly sensitive to early HD disease processes. This dynamic postural task may become a useful biomarker of HD progression.

AB  - Abstract
The formation of scar tissue following nerve injury has been shown to adversely affect nerve regeneration and evidence suggests that mannose-6-phosphate (M6P), a potential scar reducing agent that affects transforming growth factor (TGF)-β activation, may enhance nerve regeneration. In this study we utilized thy-1-YFP-H mice – a transgenic strain expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) within a subset of axons – to enable visual analysis of axons regenerating through a nerve graft. Using this strain of mouse we have developed analysis techniques to visualize and quantify regeneration of individual axons across the injury site following the application of either M6P or vehicle to the site of nerve injury.

No significant differences were found in the proportion of axons regenerating through the graft between M6P- and vehicle-treated grafts at any point along the graft length. Maximal sprouting occurred at 1.0 mm from the proximal graft ending in both groups. The maximum change in sprouting levels for both treatment groups occurred between the graft start and 0.5-mm interval for both treatment groups. The difference between repair groups was significant at this point with a greater increase seen in the vehicle group than the M6P group. The average length of axons regenerating across the initial graft entry was significantly shorter in M6P- than in vehicle-treated grafts, indicating that they encountered less impedance.

Application of M6P appears to reduce the disruption of regenerating axons and may therefore facilitate quicker recovery; this is likely to result from altered scar tissue formation in M6P grafts in the early stages of recovery. This study also establishes the usefulness of our methods of analysis using the thy-1-YFP-H mouse strain to visualize and quantify regeneration at the level of the individual axon.

AB  - Abstract
Vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased susceptibility to inflammatory arthritis. Sensory and sympathetic synovial nerves are critical to the development of inflammatory arthritis and spontaneously degenerate in the early phases of disease. These nerves contain vitamin D receptors and vitamin D influences nerve growth and neurotrophin expression. We therefore examined the density of synovial nerves and neurotrophin-containing cells in vitamin D-deficient rats. Seven-week-old Sprague–Dawley rats were fed either control or vitamin D-deficient diets for 4 weeks. Knee synovium sections extending from the patella to the meniscus were immunostained for total nerves, myelinated and unmyelinated nerves, sympathetic nerves, peptidergic and non-peptidergic sensory nerves, and neurotrophins and immune cell markers. In control rats, intimal innervation by unmyelinated sensory fibers was denser than subintimal innervation. In contrast, sympathetic innervation was confined to the subintima. Many sensory axons contained markers for both peptidergic and non-peptidergic nerves. Nerve growth factor (NGF) was primarily expressed by intimal CD163-negative type B synoviocytes, while neurturin, a ligand selective for non-peptidergic sensory neurons, was expressed by synovial mast cells. In vitamin D-deficient rats, there were significant reductions in sensory nerves in the intima and sympathetic nerves in the subintima. While there was no significant change in NGF-immunoreactivity, the number of neurturin-expressing mast cells was significantly reduced in the intima, suggesting that intimal reductions in sensory nerves may be related to reductions in neurturin. Vitamin D deficiency therefore may increase susceptibility to inflammatory arthritis by depleting sensory and sympathetic synovial nerves as a result of reduced synovial neurotrophin content.

AB  - Abstract
Deposits of amyloid-β (Aβ) protein are one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Numerous studies report that the Aβ peptide, especially in the oligomeric form, causes memory decline and other cognitive deficits. However, there have been very few effective interventions for termination or even delay of AD progression. Brilliant Blue G (BBG), a safe triphenylmethane dye and P2X7 antagonist, has been reported to have protective effects on neuroinflammation, ischemia, spinal injury and neurodegenerative disorders. Here we report that systematic administration of BBG diminishes spatial memory impairment and cognitive deficits in a mouse AD model produced by injecting soluble Aβ peptide into the hippocampal CA1 region. In addition, we show that Aβ-induced loss of filopodia and spine density in cultured hippocampal neurons was prevented by administration of BBG. We conclude that BBG prevents the learning and memory impairment and cognitive deficits induced by the toxicity of soluble Aβ, and improves the development of dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons in an AD model mouse. Considering the safety and blood–brain-barrier (BBB)-permeability of BBG, our data suggest a potential for BBG as a new therapy for AD.

AB  - Abstract
Stress is an adaptive response to demands of the environment and thus essential for survival. Exposure to stress triggers hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenocortical (HPA) axis activation and associated neurochemical reactions, following glucocorticoid release from the adrenal glands, accompanied by rapid physiological responses. Stimulation of this pathway results in the activation of specific brain regions, including the hippocampus, amygdala and prefrontal cortex which are enriched with glucocorticoid receptors (GRs). Recent findings indicate that the activation of GRs mediates the regulation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF is crucial for neural plasticity, as it promotes cellular growth and synaptic changes. Hence stress-induced activation of these pathways leads to neuroplastic changes, including the formation of long-lasting memories of the experiences. As a consequence, organisms can learn from stressful events and respond in an adaptive manner to similar demands in the future. Whereas an optimal stress level leads to enhancement of memory performance, the exposure to extreme, traumatic or chronic stressors is a risk factor for psychopathologies which are associated with memory impairment and cognitive deficits such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this review article, we will outline the implications of stress exposure on memory formation involving the role of glucocorticoids and BDNF. Within this context, potential adverse effects of neuroplastic alterations will be discussed using the example of PTSD.

AB  - Abstract
5-Hydroxytrytamine (serotonin) type 3A receptors (5-HT3ARs), as the only ligand-gated ion channels in the serotonin receptor family, are known to regulate neuronal excitation and release of GABA in hippocampal interneurons. However, their physiological role in glutamatergic synaptic plasticity remains unclear. Here, we show that deletion of the 5-HT3AR gene in transgenic mice abolished N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR)-dependent long-term depression (LTD) induced by low-frequency stimulation (LFS) in hippocampal CA1 synapses in slices, whereas the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-dependent LTD did not change in the 5-HT3AR knockout mice. In addition, 5-HT3ARs disruption inhibited α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) internalization, without altering basal surface levels of AMPARs. However, the deletion of 5-HT3ARs did not lead to loss of synapses and structural alteration of dendritic spines. Furthermore, the concentrations of 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the hippocampus were not affected by the deletion of 5-HT3ARs. These observations revealed an important role of 5-HT3ARs in NMDAR-dependent long-term depression, which is critical for learning behaviors.

AB  - Abstract
Age-related increases in right frontal cortex activation are a common finding in the neuroimaging literature. However, neurocognitive factors contributing to right frontal over-recruitment remain poorly understood. Here we investigated the influence of age-related reaction time (RT) slowing and white matter (WM) microstructure reductions as potential explanatory factors for age-related increases in right frontal activation during task switching. Groups of younger (N = 32) and older (N = 33) participants completed a task switching paradigm while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was performed, and rested while diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed. Two right frontal regions of interest (ROIs), the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and insula, were selected for further analyses from a common network of regions recruited by both age groups during task switching. Results demonstrated age-related activation increases in both ROIs. In addition, the older adult group showed longer RT and decreased fractional anisotropy in regions of the corpus callosum with direct connections to the fMRI ROIs. Subsequent mediation analyses indicated that age-related increases in right insula activation were mediated by RT slowing and age-related increases in right DLPFC activation were mediated by WM microstructure. Our results suggest that age-related RT slowing and WM microstructure declines contribute to age-related increases in right frontal activation during cognitive task performance.

AB  - Abstract
Auditory brainstem networks facilitate sound source localization through binaural integration. A key component of this circuitry is the projection from the ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) to the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), a relay nucleus that provides inhibition to the superior olivary complex. This strictly contralateral projection terminates in the large calyx of Held synapse. The formation of this pathway requires spatiotemporal coordination of cues that promote cell maturation, axon growth, and synaptogenesis. Here we have examined the emergence of distinct classes of glial cells, which are known to function in development and in response to injury. Immunofluorescence for several astrocyte markers revealed unique expression patterns. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member L1 (ALDH1L1) was expressed earliest in both nuclei, followed by S100ß, during the first postnatal week. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression was seen in the second postnatal week. GFAP-positive cell bodies remained outside the boundaries of VCN and MNTB, with a limited number of labeled fibers penetrating into the margins of the nuclei. Oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (OLIG2) expression revealed the presence of oligodendrocytes in VCN and MNTB from birth until after hearing onset. In addition, ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1)-positive microglia were observed after the first postnatal week. Following hearing onset, all glial populations were found in MNTB. We then determined the distribution of glial cells following early (P2) unilateral cochlear removal, which results in formation of ectopic projections from the intact VCN to ipsilateral MNTB. We found that following perturbation, astrocytic markers showed expression near the ectopic ipsilateral calyx. Taken together, the developmental expression patterns are consistent with a role for glial cells in the maturation of the calyx of Held and suggest that these cells may have a similar role in maturation of lesion-induced connections.

AB  - Abstract
Voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) is a mitochondrial protein abundantly found in neuronal lipid rafts. In these membrane domains, VDAC is associated with a complex of signaling proteins that trigger neuroprotective responses. Loss of lipid raft integrity may result in disruption of multicomplex association and alteration of signaling responses that may ultimately promote VDAC activation. Some data have demonstrated that VDAC at the neuronal membrane may be involved in the mechanisms of amyloid beta (Aβ)-induced neurotoxicity, through yet unknown mechanisms. Aβ is generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP), and is released to the extracellular space where it may undergo self-aggregation. Aβ aggregate deposition in the form of senile plaques may lead to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) neuropathology, although other pathological hallmarks (such as hyper-phosphorylated Tau deposition) also participate in this neurodegenerative process. The present study demonstrates that VDAC1 associates with APP and Aβ in lipid rafts of neurons. Interaction of VDAC1 with APP was observed in lipid rafts from the frontal and entorhinal cortex of human brains affected by AD at early stages (I–IV/0-B of Braak and Braak). Furthermore, Aβ exposure enhanced the dephosphorylation of VDAC1 that correlated with cell death. Both effects were reverted in the presence of tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors. VDAC1 dephosphorylation was corroborated in lipid rafts of AD brains. These results demonstrate that Aβ is involved in alterations of the phosphorylation state of VDAC in neuronal lipid rafts. Modulation of this channel may contribute to the development and progression of AD pathology.

Single-cell injection with lipophilic dyes following immunocytochemistry is extremely valuable for revealing the morphology of a cell expressing a protein of interest, and is a more reliable technique for cell type classification than standard morphological techniques. This study focuses on calretinin (CR), which is used as a selective marker for distinct subpopulations of neurons in the rabbit retina. The present study used single-cell injection after immunocytochemistry to describe the density and types of CR-containing retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in rabbit. The density of CR-immunoreactive cells in the rabbit RGC cell layer was 426 cells/mm2. CR-containing RGCs were identified by immunocytochemistry and were then iontophoretically injected with a lipophilic dye, DiI. Subsequently, confocal microscope was used to characterize the morphology of CR-immunoreactive RGCs based on their dendritic field size, branching pattern, and stratification of the inner plexiform layer. Our results show that 10 morphologically different types of rabbit RGCs expressed CR. CR-containing RGCs were heterogeneous in their morphology. This approach to integrate the selective expression of a particular protein with spatial patterns of dendritic arborization will lead to a better understanding of RGCs.

AB  - Abstract
Our previous studies on healthy individuals and stroke patients led us to propose that the dominant and nondominant arms are specialized for distinct motor control processes. We hypothesize that the dominant arm is specialized for predictive control of limb dynamics, and the nondominant arm is specialized for impedance control. We previously introduced a hybrid control scheme to explain lateralization of single-joint elbow movements. In this paper we apply a similar computational framework to explore interlimb differences in multi-joint reaching movements: the movements of both arms are initiated using predictive control mechanisms, and terminated using impedance mechanisms. Four parameters characterize predictive mechanisms, four parameters characterize impedance mechanisms, and the ninth parameter describes the instant of switch between the two modes of control. Based on our hypothesis of motor lateralization, we predict an early switch to impedance control for the nondominant arm, but a late switch, near the end of motion, for the dominant arm. We fit our model to multi-joint reaching movements of each arm, made in the horizontal plane. Our results reveal that the more curved trajectories of the nondominant arm are characterized by an early switch to impedance mechanisms, in the initial phase of motion near peak velocity. In contrast, the trajectories of the dominant arm were best fit, when the switch to impedance mechanisms occurred late in the deceleration phase of motion. These results support a model of motor lateralization in which the dominant controller is specialized for predictive control of task dynamics, while the nondominant arm is specialized for impedance control mechanisms. For the first time, we are able to operationally define handedness expressed during multi-joint movements by applying a computational control model.

AB  - Abstract
We used a reporter mouse line in which green fluorescent protein (GFP) was inserted into the orexin-1 receptor (OX1) locus to systematically map the neuroanatomical distribution of the OX1 receptor in the mouse brainstem and pons. Here, we show that the OX1 receptor is expressed in a select subset of medullary and pontine nuclei. In the medulla, we observed OX1-GFP expression in the cuneate, gracile, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (10N), nucleus of the solitary tract and medullary raphe areas. In the pons, the greatest expression was found in the locus coeruleus (LC) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). High to moderate expression was found in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg), laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, A5 noradrenergic cell group (A5) and the periaqueductal gray. Double-labeling with neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) revealed extensive co-localization in cell bodies and fibers of the 10N, A5 cell group and the PPTg. Double-staining with tyrosine hydroxylase revealed extensive co-expression in the LC, DRN and the lateral paragigantocellularis cell group in the ventral medulla. Our findings faithfully recapitulate the findings of OX1 mRNA expression previously reported. This is the first study to systematically map the neuroanatomical distribution of OX1 receptors within the mouse hindbrain and suggest that this OX1-GFP transgenic reporter mouse line might be a useful tool with which to study the neuroanatomy and physiology of OX1 receptor-expressing cells.

AB  - Abstract
Occurrence of the epileptic seizures during gestation might affect the neurodevelopment of the fetus resulting in cognitive problems for the child later in life. We have previously reported that prenatal pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-kindling induces learning and memory deficits in the children born to kindled mothers, later in life but the mechanisms involved in this processes are unknown. The cholinergic system plays a major role in learning and memory. The present study was performed to investigate the possible involvement of central muscarinic cholinergic receptors on learning and memory deficits induced by prenatal PTZ-kindling in male offspring. Pregnant Wistar rats were kindled by repetitive i.p. injection of 25 mg/kg of PTZ on day 13 of their pregnancy. The effect of intracerebroventricular (ICV) microinjection of scopolamine and pilocarpine, muscarinic cholinergic receptors antagonist and agonist, respectively on passive-avoidance learning of pups were tested at 12 weeks of age using shuttle-box apparatus. Our data showed that the retention latencies of pups that received scopolamine (2 or 3 μg) were significantly reduced compared to those received normal saline (p &lt; 0.05). Interestingly, post training ICV administration of pilocarpine (2 μg) retrieved pups’ memory deficits (p &lt; 0.001).

These results demonstrate for the first time, the importance of the central muscarinic cholinergic receptors in learning and memory deficits in pups born to kindled dams and suggest a central mechanism for the cognitive and memory dysfunction, associated with seizures during pregnancy.

AB  - Abstract
Low intensity static magnetic fields (SMFs) interact with various biological tissues including the CNS, thereby affecting key biological processes such as gene expression, cell proliferation and differentiation, as well as apoptosis. Previous studies describing the effect of SMFs on apoptotic cell death in several non-neuronal cell lines, emphasize the importance of such a potential modulation in the case of neurodegenerative disorders, where apoptosis constitutes a major route via which neurons degenerate and die.

In this study, we examine the effect of SMFs on neuronal survival in primary cortical and hippocampal neurons that constitute a suitable experimental system for modeling the neurodegenerative state in vitro. We show that weak SMF exposure interferes with the apoptotic programing in rat primary cortical and hippocampal neurons, thereby providing protection against etoposide-induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Primary cortical neurons exposed to SMF (50 G) for 7 days exhibited a 57.1 ± 6.3% decrease in the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis induced by etoposide (12 μM), accompanied by a marked decrease in the expression of the pro-apoptotic markers: cleaved poly ADP ribose polymerase-1, cleaved caspase-3, active caspase-9 and the phospho-histone H2A variant (Ser139) by 41.0 ± 5.0%, 81.2 ± 5.0%, 72.9 ± 6.4%, 42.75 ± 2.9%, respectively, and by a 57.2 ± 1.0% decrease in the extent of mitochondrial membrane potential collapse. Using the L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel inhibitor nifedipine, which is selective to Ca2+ influx through Cav1.2, we found that the anti-apoptotic effect of SMFs was mediated by Ca2+ influx through these channels. Our findings demonstrating altered Ca2+-influx in response to thapsigargin stimulation in SMF-exposed cortical neurons, along with enhanced inhibition of KCl-induced Ca2+-influx through Cav1.2 channels and enhanced expression of Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 channels, allude to the involvement of voltage- and store-operated Ca2+ channels in various aspects of the protective effect exerted by SMFs. These findings show the potential susceptibility of the CNS to weak SMF exposure and have implications for the design of novel strategies for the treatment and/or prevention of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Abstract
Ethanol abuse can lead to addiction, brain damage and premature death. The cycle of alcohol addiction has been described as a composite consisting of three stages: intoxication, withdrawal and craving/abstinence. There is evidence for contributions of both genotype and sex to alcoholism, but an understanding of the biological underpinnings is limited. Utilizing both sexes of genetic animal models with highly divergent alcohol withdrawal severity, Withdrawal Seizure-Resistant (WSR) and Withdrawal Seizure-Prone (WSP) mice, the distinct contributions of genotype/phenotype and of sex during addiction stages on neuroadaptation were characterized. Transcriptional profiling was performed to identify expression changes as a consequence of chronic intoxication in the medial prefrontal cortex. Significant expression differences were identified on a single platform and tracked over a behaviorally relevant time course that covered each stage of alcohol addiction; i.e., after chronic intoxication, during peak withdrawal, and after a defined period of abstinence. Females were more sensitive to ethanol with higher fold expression differences. Bioinformatics showed a strong effect of sex on the data structure of expression profiles during chronic intoxication and at peak withdrawal irrespective of genetic background. However, during abstinence, differences were observed instead between the lines/phenotypes irrespective of sex. Confirmation of identified pathways showed distinct inflammatory signaling following intoxication at peak withdrawal, with a pro-inflammatory phenotype in females but overall suppression of immune signaling in males. Combined, these results suggest that each stage of the addiction cycle is influenced differentially by sex vs. genetic background and support the development of stage- and sex-specific therapies for alcohol withdrawal and the maintenance of sobriety.

Hearing loss related to aging is the most common sensory disorder among elderly individuals. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a multi-functional molecule. The aim of this study was to identify the role of MIF in the inner ear. MIF-deficient mice (MIF−/− mice) of BALB/c background and wild-type BALB/c mice were used in this study. Expression of MIF protein in the inner ear was examined by immunohistochemistry in wild-type mice (WT). The hearing function was assessed by the click-evoked auditory brainstem response in both MIF−/− mice and WT at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months of age. Morphological examination of the cochlea was also performed using scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy. MIF was observed in the spiral ligament, stria vascularis, Reissner’s membrane, spiral ganglion cells (SGCs), saccular macula, and membranous labyrinth. The MIF−/− mice had a significant hearing loss as compared with the WT at 9, 12, and 18 months of age. In the MIF−/− mice, scanning electron microscopy showed that the outer cochlear hair cells were affected, but that the inner cochlear hair cells were relatively well preserved. The number of SGCs was lower in the MIF−/− mice. MIF was strongly expressed in the mouse inner ear. Older MIF−/− mice showed accelerated age-related hearing loss and morphological inner ear abnormalities. These findings suggest that MIF plays an important role in the inner ear of mice.

AB  - Abstract
β-Caryophyllene (BCP), a natural bicyclic sesquiterpene present in several essential oils, displays analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties in vitro and in vivo. Astrocytes are a major class of glial cells that regulate extracellular ion balance, repair and scarring processes in the CNS following neuroinflammatory conditions and traumatic injuries. This study sought to determine the protective effect of BCP against glutamate (Glu)-induced cytotoxicity in the C6 glioma cell line on neurochemical parameters as well as their biochemical mechanism. Glu increases intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and induces mitochondrial dysfunction as well as decreasing antioxidant defenses such as glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase activity. BCP prevented C6 cells from Glu-induced cytotoxicity by modulating the cellular antioxidant response, mainly by inhibiting ROS production and reestablishing the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm). Moreover, BCP per se induced the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) which was reflected by improvement in the cellular GSH antioxidant system. Taken together, our results suggest that cytoprotective effects of BCP were mediated by the amelioration of cellular antioxidant responses via Nrf2 activation, which is, in part, dependent on cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2R) activation. This functional nonpsychoactive CB2R ligand, could represent an important molecule for protection of glial cells against oxidative stress induced by glutamate.

AB  - Abstract
Obesity is associated with augmented peripheral inflammation and pain sensitivity in response to inflammatory stimulation, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Emerging evidence has shown that activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) in the central nervous system controls peripheral inflammation and pain. We hypothesized that obesity might down-regulate PPARα in the spinal cord, leading to enhanced peripheral inflammation and inflammatory hyperalgesia. Sprague–Dawley rats fed a high-fat diet (HF) for 12 weeks developed metabolic disorder and displayed significantly decreased spinal PPARα expression and activity. Interestingly, intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of the PPARα activator palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) in HF-fed rats for 2 weeks normalized spinal PPARα expression and activity without altering metabolic parameters. HF-fed rats were more sensitive to stimulation of the inflamed paw, and exhibited more severe paw edema following carrageenan injection, whereas HF-fed rats receiving ICV PEA had similar pain sensitivity and paw edema to LF-fed rats. No difference in the expression of inflammatory mediators or nuclear factor (NF)-κB activity was observed at baseline among groups. Carrageenan induced decreased PPARα expression and activity, increased spinal cord inflammatory mediator expression and NF-κB activity in both LF-and HF-fed rats. However, the increase was more pronounced in HF-fed rats and corrected by PEA. Intrathecal injection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) against PPARα in HF-fed rats completely abolished PEA effects on peripheral pain sensitivity and paw edema. These findings suggest that diet-induced obesity causes down-regulation of spinal PPARα, which facilitates the susceptibility to peripheral inflammatory challenge by increasing inflammatory response in the spinal cord, contributing to augmented peripheral inflammation and inflammatory hyperalgesia in obesity.

AB  - Abstract
A previous study investigating potential adult hippocampal neurogenesis in microchiropteran bats failed to reveal a strong presence of this neural trait. As microchiropterans have a high field metabolic rate and a small body mass, it is possible that capture/handling stress may lead to a decrease in the detectable presence of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Here we looked for evidence of adult hippocampal neurogenesis using immunohistochemical techniques for the endogenous marker doublecortin (DCX) in 10 species of microchiropterans euthanized and perfusion fixed at specific time points following capture. Our results reveal that when euthanized and perfused within 15 min of capture, abundant putative adult hippocampal neurogenesis could be detected using DCX immunohistochemistry. Between 15 and 30 min post-capture, the detectable levels of DCX dropped dramatically and after 30 min post-capture, immunohistochemistry for DCX could not reveal any significant evidence of putative adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Thus, as with all other mammals studied to date apart from cetaceans, bats, including both microchiropterans and megachiropterans, appear to exhibit substantial levels of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. The present study underscores the concept that, as with laboratory experiments, studies conducted on wild-caught animals need to be cognizant of the fact that acute stress (capture/handling) may induce major changes in the appearance of specific neural traits.

AB  - Abstract
The pathophysiological processes implicated in ischemic brain damage are strongly affected by an inflammatory reaction characterized by activation of immune cells and release of soluble mediators, including cytokines and chemokines. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β has been implicated in ischemic brain injury, however, to date, the mechanisms involved in the maturation of this cytokine in the ischemic brain have not been completely elucidated. We have previously suggested that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) may be implicated in cytokine production under pathological conditions. Here, we demonstrate that significant elevation of IL-1β occurs in the cortex as early as 1 h after the beginning of reperfusion in rats subjected to 2-h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). At this early stage, we observe increased expression of IL-1β in pericallosal astroglial cells and in cortical neurons and this latter signal colocalizes with elevated gelatinolytic activity. By gel zymography, we demonstrate that the increased gelatinolytic signal at 1-h reperfusion is mainly ascribed to MMP2. Thus, MMP2 seems to contribute to early brain elevation of IL-β after transient ischemia and this mechanism may promote damage since pharmacological inhibition of gelatinases by the selective MMP2/MMP9 inhibitor V provides neuroprotection in rats subjected to transient MCAo.

AB  - Abstract
The present study investigated the effects of pharmacological spinal inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) in mouse pruritus. The epidural administration of P/Q-type MVIIC or PhTx3.3, L-type verapamil, T-type NNC 55-0396 or R-type SNX-482 VGCC blockers failed to alter the scratching behavior caused by the proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) activator trypsin, injected into the mouse nape skin. Otherwise, trypsin-elicited pruritus was markedly reduced by the spinal administration of preferential N-type VGCC inhibitors MVIIA and Phα1β. Time-course experiments revealed that Conus magus-derived toxin MVIIA displayed significant effects when dosed from 1 h to 4 h before trypsin, while the anti-pruritic effects of Phα1β from Phoneutria nigriventer remained significant for up to 12 h. In addition to reducing trypsin-evoked itching, MVIIA or Phα1β also prevented the itching elicited by intradermal (i.d.) injection of SLIGRL-NH2, compound 48/80 or chloroquine, although they did not affect H2O2-induced scratching behavior. Furthermore, the co-administration of MVIIA or Phα1β markedly inhibited the pruritus caused by the spinal injection of gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), but not morphine. Notably, the epidural administration of MVIIA or Phα1β greatly prevented the chronic pruritus allied to dry skin model. However, either tested toxin failed to alter the edema formation or neutrophil influx caused by trypsin, whereas they significantly reduced the c-Fos activation in laminas I, II and III of the spinal cord. Our data bring novel evidence on itching transmission mechanisms, pointing out the therapeutic relevance of N-type VGCC inhibitors to control refractory pruritus.

AB  - Abstract
High levels of 17β-estradiol (E2) have been found to reduce inflammatory temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain. A search for genes effected by a high concentration of estradiol showed an increase in GABAA receptor subunit alpha 6 (Gabrα6) in the trigeminal ganglia (TG). Blockade of Gabrα6 expression in the TG increases masseter muscle nociception in male rats, but the relationship between estradiol’s effect on nociception and Gabrα6 expression remains unclear in females. To address this knowledge gap we hypothesized that reducing Gabrα6 expression in the TG will increase the orofacial nociceptive response of ovariectomized female rats treated with estradiol. To administer hormone osmotic pumps were placed in rats that dispensed a low diestrus plasma concentration of 17β-estradiol, in addition, 17β-estradiol was injected to produce a high proestrus plasma concentration of estradiol. A ligature was then placed around the masseter tendon to induce a nociceptive response; a model for TMJ muscle pain. Gabrα6 small interfering RNA (siRNA) was later infused into the TG and the nociceptive response was measured using von Frey filaments and a meal duration assay. GABAA receptor expression was measured in the TG and trigeminal nucleus caudalis and upper cervical region (Vc-C1). Ligature significantly increased the nociceptive response but a high proestrus concentration of 17β-estradiol attenuated this response. Gabrα6 siRNA infusion decreased Gabrα6 expression in the TG and Vc-C1 but increased the nociceptive response after 17β-estradiol treatment. The results suggest estradiol decreased the orofacial nociceptive response, in part, by causing an increase in Gabrα6 expression.

AB  - Abstract
Memories of drug experience and drug-associated environmental cues can elicit drug-seeking and taking behaviors in humans. Disruption of reconsolidation of drug memories dampens previous memories and therefore may provide a useful way to treat drug abuse. We and others previously demonstrated that dopamine D1 and D3 receptors play differential roles in acquiring cocaine-induced behaviors. Moreover, D3 receptors contribute to the reconsolidation of cocaine-induced conditioned place preference. In the present study, we examined effects of manipulating D1 or D3 receptors on reconsolidation of cocaine memories in mouse models of drug self-administration. We found that pharmacological blockade of D1 receptors or a genetic mutation of the D3 receptor gene attenuated reconsolidation that lasted for at least 1 week after the memory retrieval. In contrast, with no memory retrieval, pharmacological antagonism of D1 receptors or the D3 receptor gene mutation did not significantly affect reconsolidation of cocaine memories. Pharmacological blockade of D3 receptors also attenuated reconsolidation in wild-type mice that lasted for at least 1 week after the memory retrieval. These results suggest that D1 and D3 receptors and related signaling mechanisms play key roles in reconsolidation of cocaine memories in mice, and that these receptors may serve as novel targets for the treatment of cocaine abuse in humans.

AB  - Abstract
Neurons in the superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex provide the hippocampus with the majority of its cortical sensory input, and also receive the major output projection from the parasubiculum. This puts the parasubiculum in a position to modulate the activity of entorhinal neurons that project to the hippocampus. These brain areas receive cholinergic projections that are active during periods of theta- and gamma-frequency electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. The purpose of this study was to investigate how cholinergic receptor activation affects the strength of repetitive synaptic responses at these frequencies in the parasubiculo-entorhinal pathway and the cellular mechanisms involved. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of rat layer II medial entorhinal neurons were conducted using an acute slice preparation, and responses to 5-pulse trains of stimulation at theta- and gamma-frequency delivered to the parasubiculum were recorded. The cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh) suppressed the amplitude of single synaptic responses, but also produced a relative facilitation of synaptic responses evoked during stimulation trains. The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor blocker APV did not significantly reduce the relative facilitation effect. However, the hyperpolarization-activated cationic current (Ih) channel blocker ZD7288 mimicked the relative facilitation induced by CCh, suggesting that CCh-induced inhibition of Ih could produce the effect by increasing dendritic input resistance (Rin). Inward-rectifying and leak K+ currents are known to interact with Ih to affect synaptic excitability. Application of the K+ channel antagonist Ba2+ depolarized neurons and enhanced temporal summation, but did not block further facilitation of train-evoked responses by ZD7288. The Ih-dependent facilitation of synaptic responses can therefore occur during reductions in inward-rectifying potassium current (IKir) associated with dendritic depolarization. Thus, in addition to cholinergic reductions in transmitter release that are known to facilitate train-evoked responses, these findings emphasize the role of inhibition of Ih in the integration of synaptic inputs within the entorhinal cortex during cholinergically-induced oscillatory states, likely due to enhanced summation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) induced by increases in dendritic Rin.

AB  - Abstract
The mechanisms of aging in the brain and the subsequent decrease in cognitive abilities remain elusive. While most studies refer to research conducted in old and senile animals, little is known about the early symptoms of normal, healthy aging. In this study, we examined whether perineuronal nets (PNNs), a special form of extracellular matrix (ECM) tightly associated with neurons that is thought to be involved in limiting neuronal plasticity, undergo changes in density during early aging. Using histochemistry and immunohistochemistry, we found that in middle-aged mice (1-year-old), the density of WFA-binding PNNs in the somatosensory cortex as well as in the visual cortex was increased in comparison to that in young adults (3-month-old). Moreover, in the somatosensory cortex, this increase was not associated with any of the GABAergic neuron types that were examined. We propose that early age-related changes in neuronal plasticity may be associated with this increase and can be conceptualized as the spreading of structural brakes for synaptic rearrangements.

Loudness is the primary perceptual correlate of sound intensity. The relationship between sound intensity and loudness is not fixed, and can be modified by short-term sound deprivation or stimulation. Deprivation increases sound sensitivity, whereas stimulation decreases it. We review the effects of short-term auditory deprivation and stimulation on the auditory central nervous system of humans and animals, and we extend the discussion to permanent auditory deprivation (hearing loss) and auditory pathologies of loudness perception. Although there is sufficient evidence to conclude that loudness can be modulated in normal hearing listeners by temporary sound deprivation and stimulation, evidence is scanter for the hearing-impaired listeners. In addition, cortical effects of sound deprivation and stimulation in humans, which may correlate with loudness coding, are still largely unknown and should be the target of future research.

Prion diseases are neurodegenerative and infectious disorders that involve accumulation of misfolded scrapie prion protein, and which are characterized by spongiform degeneration. Autophagy, a major homeostatic process responsible for the degradation of cytoplasmic components, has garnered attention as the potential target for neurodegenerative diseases such as prion disease. We focused on protective effects of sulforaphane found in cruciferous vegetables on prion-mediated neurotoxicity and the mechanism of sulforaphane related to autophagy. In human neuroblastoma cells, sulforaphane protected prion protein (PrP) (106–126)-mediated neurotoxicity and increased autophagy flux marker microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II protein levels, following a decrease of p62 protein level. Pharmacological and genetical inhibition of autophagy by 3MA, wortmannin and knockdown of autophagy-related 5 (ATG5) led to block the effect of sulforaphane against PrP (106–126)-induced neurotoxicity. Furthermore we demonstrated that both sulforaphane-induced autophagy and protective effect of sulforaphane against PrP (106–126)-induced neurotoxicity are dependent on the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. The present results indicated that sulforaphane of cruciferous vegetables enhanced autophagy flux led to the protection effects against prion-mediated neurotoxicity, which was regulated by AMPK signaling pathways in human neuron cells. Our data also suggest that sulforaphane has a potential value as a therapeutic tool in neurodegenerative disease including prion diseases.

AB  - Abstract
Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) exerts cytoprotection against many cellular insults including cerebral ischemia. We previously indicated that intravenous injection of HSP27 purified from human lymphocytes (hHSP27) significantly reduced infarct volume following cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury, while recombinant HSP27 (rHSP27) was less effective. Phosphorylation is important for HSP27 function, and hHSP27 was more highly phosphorylated than rHSP27. We hypothesized that MAPKAP kinase 2 in vitro-phosphorylated rHSP27 (prHSP27) might increase its brain protection. Mice underwent transient 1-h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and then received tail-vein injections of one of the following 1 h after reperfusion: hHSP27 as positive control, rHSP27, prHSP27, or bovine serum albumin (BSA) as control. We measured infarct volume, neurological deficits, neurological severity, physiological parameters, cell-death, oxidative stress, and inflammatory response. Compared with BSA controls (30.7 ± 3.1mm3, n = 5), infarct volume was reduced by 67% in the hHSP27 positive-control group (10.1 ± 4.6mm3, P &lt; 0.001, n = 5), 17% following rHSP27 (25.4 ± 3.6mm3, P &lt; 0.05, n = 5), and 46% following prHSP27 (16.5 ± 4.0mm3, P &lt; 0.001, n = 9). Compared to the rHSP27 and BSA-treated groups, prHSP27 also reduced functional deficits, and significantly suppressed apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses. Here, we showed the superior neuroprotective effects of phosphorylated HSP27 by administering prHSP27. prHSP27 may be a useful therapeutic agent to protect against acute cerebral ischemic stroke.

AB  - Abstract
The adult brain retains a considerable capacity to functionally reorganize its circuits, which mainly relies on the prevalence of three basic processes that confer plastic potential: synaptic plasticity, plastic changes in intrinsic excitability and, in certain central nervous system (CNS) regions, also neurogenesis. Experimental models of peripheral nerve injury have provided a useful paradigm for studying injury-induced mechanisms of central plasticity. In particular, axotomy of somatic motoneurons triggers a robust retrograde reaction in the CNS, characterized by the expression of plastic changes affecting motoneurons, their synaptic inputs and surrounding glia. Axotomized motoneurons undergo a reprograming of their gene expression and biosynthetic machineries which produce cell components required for axonal regrowth and lead them to resume a functionally dedifferentiated phenotype characterized by the removal of afferent synaptic contacts, atrophy of dendritic arbors and an enhanced somato-dendritic excitability. Although experimental research has provided valuable clues to unravel many basic aspects of this central response, we are still lacking detailed information on the cellular/molecular mechanisms underlying its expression. It becomes clear, however, that the state-switch must be orchestrated by motoneuron-derived signals produced under the direction of the re-activated growth program. Our group has identified the highly reactive gas nitric oxide (NO) as one of these signals, by providing robust evidence for its key role to induce synapse elimination and increases in intrinsic excitability following motor axon damage. We have elucidated operational principles of the NO-triggered downstream transduction pathways mediating each of these changes. Our findings further demonstrate that de novo NO synthesis is not only “necessary” but also “sufficient” to promote the expression of at least some of the features that reflect reversion toward a dedifferentiated state in axotomized adult motoneurons.

AB  - Abstract
Despite the debilitating consequences and the widespread prevalence of brain trauma insults including spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI), there are currently few effective therapies for most of brain trauma sequelae. As a consequence, there has been a major quest for identifying better diagnostic tools, predictive models, and directed neurotherapeutic strategies in assessing brain trauma. Among the hallmark features of brain injury pathology is the central nervous systems’ (CNS) abnormal activation of the immune response post-injury. Of interest, is the occurrence of autoantibodies which are produced following CNS trauma-induced disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and released into peripheral circulation mounted against self-brain-specific proteins acting as autoantigens. Recently, autoantibodies have been proposed as the new generation class of biomarkers due to their long-term presence in serum compared to their counterpart antigens. The diagnostic and prognostic value of several existing autoantibodies is currently being actively studied. Furthermore, the degree of direct and latent contribution of autoantibodies to CNS insult is still not fully characterized. It is being suggested that there may be an analogy of CNS autoantibodies secretion with the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases, in which case, understanding and defining the role of autoantibodies in brain injury paradigm (SCI and TBI) may provide a realistic prospect for the development of effective neurotherapy. In this work, we will discuss the accumulating evidence about the appearance of autoantibodies following brain injury insults. Furthermore, we will provide perspectives on their potential roles as pathological components and as candidate markers for detecting and assessing CNS injury.

We totally enrolled twenty healthy controls and 18 stroke patients. The stroke patients were divided into two subgroups on the basis of the cognitive assays. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were recorded 10 days and 3 months after the stroke. Independent component analysis was used to isolate the DMN. One-way analysis of variance was performed to detect different FC among groups. Pearson correlation analyses were conducted to determine the relationships between FC strength and the MoCA and MMSE scores.
Results
Compared to healthy controls, both Non-PSCI patients and PSCI patients showed significantly decreased FC in the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PCu), as well as increased FC in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and left hippocampus. However, Non-PSCI patients showed more significantly increased FC in the MPFC and hippocampus than PSCI patients did. The FC in the PCC/PCu was related to the MoCA score measured at a 10-day follow-up, and the FC in the left hippocampus predicted the MoCA score measured at 3 months follow-up.
Conclusions
Our findings may be helpful for facilitating further understanding of the potential mechanism underlying PSCI, and suggests that resting-state DMN connectivity could serve as neuroimaging biomarkers for future interventional studies.

AB  - Abstract
Gliomas are the most common malignant intracranial tumors. Newly developed targeted therapies for these cancers aim to inhibit oncogenic signals, many of which emanate from receptor tyrosine kinases, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR). Unfortunately, the first-generation treatments targeting these oncogenic signals provide little survival benefit in both mouse xenograft models and human patients. The search for new treatment options has uncovered several G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) candidates and generated a growing interest in this class of proteins as alternative therapeutic targets for the treatment of various cancers, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). GPCRs constitute a large family of membrane receptors that influence oncogenic pathways through canonical and non-canonical signaling. Accordingly, evidence indicates that GPCRs display a unique ability to crosstalk with receptor tyrosine kinases, making them important molecular components controlling tumorigenesis. This review summarizes the current research on GPCR functionality in gliomas and explores the potential of modulating these receptors to treat this devastating disease.

AB  - Abstract
Nogo-A interaction with its different receptors (Nogo receptor 1 (NgR1), S1P receptor 2 (S1PR2), paired immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB)) restricts plasticity and growth-dependent processes leading, via the activation of different signaling pathway to the stabilization of the neuronal networks (either developmentally or during processes of memory consolation in the mature nervous system). Taking away these molecular brakes might allow for the induction of extensive structural and functional rearrangements and might promote compensatory growth processes after an injury of the CNS, in cortical structures as well as in the spinal cord. However, it is important to keep in mind that this could as well be a dangerous endeavor, since it might facilitate unwanted and unnecessary (and probably even maladaptive) neuronal connections.

AB  - Abstract
γ-Hydroxybutyrate (GHB) has a complex array of neural actions that include effects on its own high-affinity GHB receptor, the release of neuroactive steroids, and agonist actions at GABAA and GABAB receptors. We previously reported partial overlap in the c-Fos expression patterns produced by GHB and the GABAB agonist, baclofen in rats. The present study extends these earlier findings by examining the extent to which GHB Fos expression and behavioral sedation are prevented by (2S)-(+)-5,5-dimethyl-2-morpholineacetic acid (SCH 50911), a GABAB antagonist, and NCS-382, a putative antagonist at the high-affinity GHB receptor. We also compare Fos expression caused by GHB and its precursor γ-butyrolactone (GBL), which is a pro-drug for GHB but lacks the high sodium content of the parent GHB molecule. Both GHB (1000 mg/kg) and GBL (600 mg/kg) induced rapid sedation in rats that lasted over 90 min and caused similar Fos expression patterns, albeit with GBL causing greater activation of the nucleus accumbens (core and shell) and dentate gyrus (granular layer). Pretreatment with SCH 50911 (100 mg/kg) partly reversed the sedative effects of GHB and significantly reduced GHB-induced Fos expression in only four regions: the tenia tecta, lateral habenula, dorsal raphe and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus. NCS-382 (50 mg/kg) had no effect on GHB-induced sedation or Fos expression. When given alone, both NCS-382 and SCH 50911 increased Fos expression in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, central amygdala, parasubthalamic nucleus and nucleus of the solitary tract. SCH 50911 alone affected the Islands of Calleja and the medial, central and paraventricular thalamic nuclei. Overall, this study shows a surprising lack of reversal of GHB-induced Fos expression by two relevant antagonists, both of which have marked intrinsic actions. This may reflect the limited doses tested but also suggests that GHB Fos expression reflects mechanisms independent of GHB and GABAB receptors.

AB  - Abstract
Current evidence suggests that inflammation plays a role in the pathophysiology of seizures. In line with this view, selected pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid derivatives have been reported to facilitate seizures. Kainate-induced seizures are accompanied by leukotriene formation, and are reduced by inhibitors of LOX/COX pathway. Moreover, LTD4 receptor blockade and LTD4 synthesis inhibition suppress pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced kindling and pilocarpine-induced recurrent seizures. Although there is convincing evidence supporting that blood–brain-barrier (BBB) dysfunction facilitates seizures, no study has investigated whether the anticonvulsant effect of montelukast is associated with its ability to maintain BBB integrity. In this study we investigated whether montelukast and other CysLT receptor antagonists decrease PTZ-induced seizures, as well as whether these antagonists preserve BBB during PTZ-induced seizures.

Adult male albino Swiss mice were stereotaxically implanted with a cannula into the right lateral ventricle, and two electrodes were placed over the parietal cortex along with a ground lead positioned over the nasal sinus for electroencephalography (EEG) recording. The effects of montelukast (0.03 or 0.3 μmol/1 μL, i.c.v.), pranlukast (1 or 3 μmol/1 μL, i.c.v.), Bay u-9773 (0.3, 3 or 30 nmol/1 μL, i.c.v.), in the presence or absence of the agonist LTD4 (0.2, 2, 6 or 20 pmol/1 μL, i.c.v.), on PTZ (1.8 μmol/2 μL)-induced seizures and BBB permeability disruption were determined. The animals were injected with the antagonists, agonist or vehicle 30 min before PTZ, and monitored for additional 30 min for the appearance of seizures by electrographic and behavioral methods. BBB permeability was assessed by sodium fluorescein method and by confocal microscopy for CD45 and IgG immunoreactivity. Bay-u9973 (3 and 30 nmol), montelukast (0.03 and 0.3 μmol) and pranlukast (1 and 3 μmol), increased the latency to generalized seizures and decreased the mean amplitude of EEG recordings during seizures. LTD4 (0.2 and 2 pmol) reverted the anticonvulsant effect of montelukast (0.3 μmol). Montelukast (0.03 and 0.3 μmol) prevented PTZ-induced BBB disruption, an effect that was reversed by LTD4 at the dose of 6 pmol, but not at the doses 0.2 and 2 pmol. Moreover, the doses of LTD4 (0.2 and 2 pmol) that reverted the effect of montelukast on seizures did not alter montelukast-induced protection of BBB, dissociating BBB protection and anticonvulsant activity. Confocal microscopy analysis revealed that 1. PTZ increased the number of CD45+ and double-immunofluorescence staining for CD45 and IgG cells in the cerebral cortex, indicating BBB leakage with leukocyte infiltration; 2. while LTD4 (6 pmol) potentiated, montelukast decreased the effect of PTZ on leukocyte migration and BBB, assessed by double-immunofluorescence staining for CD45 and IgG cells in the cannulated hemisphere. Our data do not allow us ruling out that mechanisms unrelated and related to BBB protection may co-exist, resulting in decreased seizure susceptibility by montelukast. Notwithstanding, they suggest that CysLT1 receptors may be a suitable target for anticonvulsant development.

AB  - Abstract
Fat, ethanol, and nicotine share a number of properties, including their ability to reinforce behavior and produce overconsumption. To test whether these substances act similarly on the same neuronal populations in specific brain areas mediating these behaviors, we administered the substances short-term, using the same methods and within the same experiment, and measured their effects, in areas of the hypothalamus (HYPO), amygdala (AMYG), and nucleus accumbens (NAc), on mRNA levels of the opioid peptide, enkephalin (ENK), using in situ hybridization and on c-Fos immunoreactivity (ir) to indicate neuronal activity, using immunofluorescence histochemistry. In addition, we examined for comparison another reinforcing substance, sucrose, and also took measurements of stress-related behaviors and circulating corticosterone (CORT) and triglycerides (TG), to determine if they contribute to these substances’ behavioral and physiological effects. Adult Sprague–Dawley rats were gavaged three times daily over 5 days with 3.5 mL of water, Intralipid (20% v/v), ethanol (12% v/v), nicotine (0.01% w/v) or sucrose (22% w/v) (approximately 7 kcal/dose), and tail vein blood was collected for measurements of circulating CORT and TG. On day five, animals were sacrificed, brains removed, and the HYPO, AMYG, and NAc processed for single- or double-labeling of ENK mRNA and c-Fos-ir. Fat, ethanol, and nicotine, but not sucrose, increased the single- and double-labeling of ENK and c-Fos-ir in precisely the same brain areas, the middle parvocellular but not lateral area of the paraventricular nucleus, central but not basolateral nucleus of the AMYG, and core but not shell of the NAc. While having little effect on stress-related behaviors or CORT levels, fat, ethanol, and nicotine all increased circulating levels of TG. These findings suggest that the overconsumption of these three substances and their potential for abuse are mediated by the same populations of ENK-expressing neurons in specific nuclei of the hypothalamus and limbic system.

AB  - Abstract
Reaction time (RT), a widely used measure of human performance in experimental psychology, has recently been included as a regressor of interest in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analysis. Few studies reported RT-related brain regions, but the nature of this activity is not fully understood. We aimed at exploring this topic by implementing a simple saccadic task which evokes fast and homogeneous reactions that require only the basic neural processes. Thus, a spatial cueing paradigm was chosen and implemented in a simultaneous fMRI and eye-tracking experiment. As a result, we found a wide set of brain regions showing trial-by-trial correlations of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal with saccadic RT. These regions included medial and lateral frontal lobes, bilateral intraparietal sulci, anterior insular cortices as well as the right thalamus and medial visual cortex. Further analysis was conducted in order to verify quantitatively the impact of a “time on task” effect on task-related hemodynamic responses (HDRs). The results provide evidence that even a small difference in RTs can be linked with significant increase of HDR in task-related areas. Moreover, this increase is not linear, but rather quadratic. Our findings highlight the importance of controlling for RT in fMRI data analysis when contrasting conditions that vary in RT to avoid the misinterpretation of results.

AB  - Abstract
The generation of new neurons in the dentate gyrus of the adult brain has been demonstrated in many species including humans and is suggested to have functional relevance for learning and memory. The wake promoting drug modafinil has popularly been categorized as a so-called neuroenhancer due to its positive effects on cognition. We here show that short- and long-term treatment with modafinil differentially effects hippocampal neurogenesis. We used different thymidine analogs (5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU), chlorodeoxyuridine (CldU), iododeoxyuridine (IdU)) and labeling protocols to investigate distinct regulative events during hippocampal neurogenesis, namely cell proliferation and survival. Eight-week-old mice that were treated with modafinil (64 mg/kg, i.p.) every 24 h for 4 days show increased proliferation in the dentate gyrus indicated by BrdU-labeling and more newborn granule cells 3 weeks after treatment. Short-term treatment for 4 days also enhanced the number of postmitotic calretinin-expressing progenitor cells that were labeled with BrdU 1 week prior to treatment indicating an increased survival of new born immature granule cells. Interestingly, long-term treatment for 14 days resulted in an increased number of newborn Prox1+ granule cells, but we could not detect an additive effect of the prolonged treatment on proliferation and survival of newborn cells. Moreover, daily administration for 14 days did not influence the number of proliferating cells in the dentate gyrus. Together, modafinil has an acute impact on precursor cell proliferation as well as survival but loses this ability during longer treatment durations.

AB  - Abstract
Activation of the orexin (OX)-ergic neurons in the perifornical (PeF) area has been reported to induce waking and reduce rapid eye movement sleep (REMS). The activities of OX-ergic neurons are maximum during active waking and they progressively reduce during non-REMS (NREMS) and REMS. Apparently, the locus coeruleus (LC) neurons also behave in a comparable manner as that of the OX-ergic neurons particularly in relation to waking and REMS. Further, as PeF OX-ergic neurons send dense projections to LC, we argued that the former could drive the LC neurons to modulate waking and REMS. Studies in freely moving normally behaving animals where simultaneously neuro–chemo–anatomo–physio-behavioral information could be deciphered would significantly strengthen our understanding on the regulation of REMS. Therefore, in this study in freely behaving chronically prepared rats we stimulated the PeF neurons without or with simultaneous blocking of specific subtypes of OX-ergic receptors in the LC while electrophysiological recording characterizing sleep–waking was continued. Single dose of glutamate stimulation as well as sustained mild electrical stimulation of PeF (both bilateral) significantly increased waking and reduced REMS as compared to baseline. Simultaneous application of OX-receptor1 (OX1R) antagonist bilaterally into the LC prevented PeF stimulation-induced REMS suppression. Also, the effect of electrical stimulation of the PeF was long lasting as compared to that of the glutamate stimulation. Further, sustained electrical stimulation significantly decreased both REMS duration as well as REMS frequency, while glutamate stimulation decreased REMS duration only.

AB  - Abstract
In genetically-modified Lmx1bf/f/p mice, selective deletion of LMX1B in Pet-1 expressing cells leads to failure of embryonic development of serotonin (5-HT) neurons. As adults, these mice have a decreased hypercapnic ventilatory response and abnormal thermoregulation. This mouse model has been valuable in defining the normal role of 5-HT neurons, but it is possible that developmental compensation reduces the severity of observed deficits. Here we studied mice genetically modified to express diphtheria toxin receptors (DTR) on Pet-1 expressing neurons (Pet-1-Cre/floxed DTR or Pet1/DTR mice). These mice developed with a normal complement of 5-HT neurons. As adults, systemic treatment with 2–35 μg of diphtheria toxin (DT) reduced the number of tryptophan hydroxylase-immunoreactive (TpOH-ir) neurons in the raphe nuclei and ventrolateral medulla by 80%. There were no effects of DT on minute ventilation (VE) or the ventilatory response to hypercapnia or hypoxia. At an ambient temperature (TA) of 24 °C, all Pet1/DTR mice dropped their body temperature (TB) below 35 °C after DT treatment, but the latency was shorter in males than females (3.0 ± 0.37 vs. 4.57 ± 0.29 days, respectively; p &lt; 0.001). One week after DT treatment, mice were challenged by dropping TA from 37 °C to 24 °C, which caused TB to decrease more in males than in females (29.7 ± 0.31 °C vs. 33.0 ± 1.3 °C, p &lt; 0.01). We conclude that the 20% of 5-HT neurons that remain after DT treatment in Pet1/DTR mice are sufficient to maintain normal baseline breathing and a normal response to CO2, while those affected include some essential for thermoregulation, in males more than females. In comparison to models with deficient embryonic development of 5-HT neurons, acute deletion of 5-HT neurons in adults leads to a greater defect in thermoregulation, suggesting that significant developmental compensation can occur.

AB  - Abstract
When performing self-paced movements in a fatigued state, internal models can predict the mechanical effects of muscle fatigue. Yet, it is unclear if this is still true when movements are submitted to additional constraints. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the Central Nervous System’s (CNS) capacity to integrate fatigue signals into forward models’ prediction processes when the movement to perform is unpredictable and temporally constrained. Participants had to perform two different focal movements, depending on the random presentation of color word-color associations (Stroop-like task). They had to trigger fast arm extensions and flexions in a standing posture at the presentation of congruent and incongruent colors, respectively. These movements involve the implementation of predictive mechanisms of control, namely Anticipatory Postural Adjustments (APAs), which have been shown to depend on arm peak acceleration. APA timing and magnitude were measured using surface electromyography. The experimental task was performed before and after a fatiguing protocol involving the prime mover of the flexion movement. According to the assumption that APAs are constructed upstream from the primary motor cortex (M1), up to 1.4 s before movement onset on the basis of the processing of the relevant contextual-sensory information, the Stroop-like task aimed to prevent participants from predicting the movement to perform and to reduce movement preparation time. While the fatigue protocol resulted in significant alterations of arm flexion peak accelerations, APAs were not modified post-fatigue as compared to control trials. It is proposed that with unpredictable and temporally constrained movements, the CNS cannot incorporate fatigue signals in internal models’ prediction processes to reweight the motor information contained in the efference copy. It is also suggested that APA implementation is based on predictive processes occurring in internal models located upstream from M1.

AB  - Abstract
Tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) is an active compound extracted from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Chuanxiong. Recently, it has been reported that TMP enhances neurogenesis, and promotes neural stem cell differentiation toward neurons. However, its molecular basis remains unknown. Topoisomerase IIβ (TopoIIβ) is a nuclear enzyme with an essential role in neuronal development. This study aimed to investigate whether TopoIIβ is involved in TMP-induced neuronal differentiation. We examined the effect of TMP on neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells. It was found that TMP inhibited cell proliferation and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. TMP promoted SH-SY5Y cells to differentiate toward post-mitotic neurons characterized by long, out-branched neurites and up-regulated neuronal markers, microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and tau. Meanwhile, we demonstrated that TopoIIβ was highly expressed following TMP treatment. To unravel how TMP affects TopoIIβ expression, two chromatin active markers, acetylated histone H3 (Ac-H3) and acetylated histone H4 (Ac-H4) were examined in this study. Our data showed that the levels of Ac-H3 and Ac-H4 were positively correlated with TopoIIβ expression in the processes of neuronal differentiation. We further performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis and identified that TMP enhanced the recruitment of Ac-H3 and Ac-H4 to the TopoIIβ gene promoter region. Therefore, we concluded that TMP may stimulate neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells through epigenetic regulation of TopoIIβ. These results suggest a novel molecular mechanism underlying TMP-promoted neuronal differentiation.

AB  - Abstract
Neuropathic pain is a chronic, refractory condition that arises after damage to the nervous system. We previously showed that an increased level of the endogenous metabolite N,N-dimethylsphingosine (DMS) in the central nervous system (CNS) is sufficient to induce neuropathic pain-like behavior in rats. However, several important questions remain. First, it has not yet been demonstrated that DMS is produced in humans and its value as a therapeutic target is therefore unknown. Second, the cell types within the CNS that produce DMS are currently unidentified. Here we provide evidence that DMS is present in human CNS tissue. We show that DMS levels increase in demyelinating lesions isolated from patients with multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease in which the majority of patients experience chronic pain. On the basis of these results, we hypothesized that oligodendrocytes may be a cellular source of DMS. We show that human oligodendrocytes produce DMS in culture and that the levels of DMS increase when oligodendrocytes are challenged with agents that damage white matter. These results suggest that damage to oligodendrocytes leads to increased DMS production which in turn drives inflammatory astrocyte responses involved in sensory neuron sensitization. Interruption of this pathway in patients may provide analgesia without the debilitating side effects that are commonly observed with other chronic pain therapies.

AB  - Abstract
Cell-type compartmentation of glucose metabolism in the brain involves trafficking of the oxidizable glycolytic end product, l-lactate, by astrocytes to fuel neuronal mitochondrial aerobic respiration. Lactate availability within the hindbrain medulla is a monitored function that regulates systemic glucostasis as insulin-induced hypoglycemia (IIH) is exacerbated by lactate repletion of that brain region. A2 noradrenergic neurons are a plausible source of lactoprivic input to the neural gluco-regulatory circuit as caudal fourth ventricular (CV4) lactate infusion normalizes IIH-associated activation, e.g. phosphorylation of the high-sensitivity energy sensor, adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), in these cells. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that A2 neurons are unique among medullary catecholamine cells in directly screening lactate-derived energy. Adult male rats were injected with insulin or vehicle following initiation of continuous l-lactate infusion into the CV4. Two hours after injections, A1, C1, A2, and C2 neurons were collected by laser-microdissection for Western blot analysis of AMPKα1/2 and phosphoAMPKα1/2 proteins. Results show that AMPK is expressed in each cell group, but only a subset, e.g. A1, C1, and A2 neurons, exhibit increased sensor activity in response to IIH. Moreover, hindbrain lactate repletion reversed hypoglycemic augmentation of pAMPKα1/2 content in A2 and C1 but not A1 cells, and normalized hypothalamic norepinephrine and epinephrine content in a site-specific manner. The present evidence for discriminative reactivity of AMPK-expressing medullary catecholamine neurons to the screened energy substrate lactate implies that that lactoprivation is selectively signaled to the hypothalamus by A2 noradrenergic and C1 adrenergic cells.

AB  - Abstract
Midbrain dopamine neurons fire irregularly, with interspersed clusters of high-frequency spikes, commonly called ‘bursts’. In this review we examine such heterogeneity in activity, and provide insight into how it can participate in psychiatric conditions such as drug addiction. We first describe several techniques used to evaluate dopamine neuron activity, and comment on the different measures that each provides. We next describe the activity of dopamine neurons in ‘basal’ conditions. Specifically, we discuss how the use of anesthesia and reduced preparations may alter aspects of dopamine cell activity, and how there is heterogeneity across species and regions. We also describe how dopamine cell firing changes throughout the peri-adolescent period and how dopamine neuron activity differs across the population. In the final section, we discuss how dopamine neuron activity changes in response to life events. First, we focus attention on drugs of abuse. Drugs themselves change firing activity through a variety of mechanisms, with effects on firing while drug is present differing from those seen after drug discontinuation. We then review how stimuli that are rewarding, aversive, or salient can evoke changes in firing rate and discharge pattern of dopamine neurons, and provide behavioral relevance of dopamine signaling. Finally, we discuss how stress can modulate dopamine neuron firing and how this may contribute to the role that stressful experiences play in psychiatric disorders such as addiction and depression.

AB  - Abstract
Intraneuronal accumulation of beta-amyloid protein (Aβ) is an early pathological change in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent studies demonstrate that α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) binds to soluble Aβ with a high affinity. In vitro and in vivo experiments also show that Aβ activates p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 signaling pathways via the α7nAChR. Interestingly, it has been reported that p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 signaling pathways affect the regulation of receptor-mediated endocytosis. These data suggest that MAPK signaling pathways maybe involved in the regulation of α7nAChR-mediated Aβ uptake. However, the evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. In the present study, we examined whether Aβ1–42 oligomers activate MAPK signaling pathways via α7nAChR, and assessed the role of MAPK signaling pathways in the regulation of Aβ1–42 uptake by α7nAChR. We confirm that undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells are capable of taking up extracellular Aβ1–42. The internalization of Aβ1–42 accumulates in the endosomes/lysosomes and mitochondria. MAPK signaling pathways are activated by Aβ1–42 via α7nAChR. Aβ1–42 and α7nAChR are co-localized in SH-SY5Y cells and the expression of α7nAChR involves in Aβ1–42 uptake and accumulation in SH-SY5Y cells. Our data demonstrate that Aβ1–42 induces an α7nAChR-dependent pathway that relates to the activation of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2, resulting in internalization of Aβ1–42. Our findings suggest that α7nAChR and MAPK signaling pathways play an important role in the uptake and accumulation of Aβ1–42 in SH-SY5Y cells. Blockade of α7nAChR may have a beneficial effect by limiting intracellular accumulation of amyloid in AD brain and serves a potential therapeutic target for AD.

AB  - Abstract
Adrenomedullin (AM) belongs to a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) family and has been demonstrated to recruit CGRP following chronic use of morphine and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in inflammation. The present study investigated the possibility that AM initiates the changes of other molecules contributing to the development of morphine tolerance in its chronic use. Intrathecal (i.t.) co-administration of the AM receptor antagonist AM22–52 (35.8 μg) inhibited tolerance to morphine-induced analgesia while a daily injection of the AM receptor agonist AM1–50 (8 μg, i.t., bolus) for 9 days induced a decrease in the potency of morphine analgesia and thermal hyperalgesia. Persistent exposure of cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants to morphine (3.3 μM) for 4 days resulted in an increase in AM and CGRP mRNA levels. However, morphine failed to produce these effects in the presence of AM22–52 (2 μM). The i.t. administration of morphine for 6 days increased the expression of nNOS in the spinal dorsal horn and DRG neurons but decreased expression of the endogenous opioid peptide bovine adrenal medulla 22 (BAM22) in small- and medium-sized neurons in DRG. Particularly, the co-administration of AM22–52 (35.8 μg) inhibited the morphine-induced alterations in nNOS and BAM22. These results indicated that the increase in nNOS and CGRP expressions and the decrease in BAM22 were attributed to the increased AM receptor signaling induced by chronic morphine. The present study supports the hypothesis that the enhancement of AM bioactivity triggered upregulation of pronociceptive mediators and downregulation of pain-inhibiting molecule in a cascade contributing to the development of morphine tolerance.

AB  - Abstract
Cav2.2 channels are a substrate for phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes. The contribution of Cavβ, an auxiliary subunit of these channels, in the PKC modulation was studied. Cav2.2 channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes in various subunit combinations with or without Cavβ subunits. Currents were recorded using a two-electrode voltage clamp with barium as the charge carrier (IBa). Acetyl-β-methylcholine (MCh), an activator of PKCα, potentiated Cav2.2 currents expressed with Cav2.2α1 alone or Cav2.2α1α2/δ. Similarly PKC isozymes α, βII or ɛ potentiated IBa through Cav2.2α1 subunit channels. In contrast, MCh failed to potentiate currents expressed with Cav2.2α1 and Cavβ1b, β2a, β3 or β4 subunits. Similarly, in the presence of Cavβ1b subunits, PKC isozymes failed to potentiate these currents; contrarily, PKCs α or βII decreased the IBa. MCh failed to potentiate Cav2.2α1 subunit currents in the serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) → alanine mutants, T422A, S1757A or S2132A of Cav2.2α1 subunits. Hence Thr-422, Ser-1757 and Ser-2132 may be PKCα isozyme target sites. The action of PKC on these sites was further substantiated by the increased basal IBa along with the loss of MCh potentiation when Ser/Thr was mutated to aspartate. The observation that MCh or PKC isozymes failed to affect Cav2.2 currents in the presence of Cavβ subunits suggests that these subunits may have interfered with the interaction between PKC and Ser/Thr sites of Cav2.2α1 subunits. In addition to affecting channel expression and current kinetics, Cavβ subunits may also modulate the response of these channels to neurochemicals.

AB  - Abstract
Stroke is a leading cause of death and morbidity worldwide, yet effective treatments are lacking. The association of prostaglandin D2 and its DP1 receptor with vasculature and blood propelled us to examine whether the clinically tested DP1 receptor agonist BW245C had beneficial effects following stroke. To determine if BW245C affects basal cerebral blood flow (CBF), C57BL/6 WT and DP1−/− mice were given a single i.p. injection of vehicle or BW245C, and CBF was recorded for 2 h. To test the effect of BW245C on stroke, WT and DP1−/− mice were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion followed by a single i.p. injection of vehicle or 0.02, 0.2, or 2.0-mg/kg BW245C immediately before reperfusion. Functional and anatomical outcomes were determined at 96 h. We also determined the effect of BW245C on CBF in peri-infarct and core during occlusion and reperfusion. Furthermore, we tested the effect of BW245C on bleeding time and ex vivo coagulation. BW245C treatment increased the basal CBF significantly in WT but not in DP1−/− mice. The BW245C treatment also significantly improved functional outcome and lowered infarction volume. The multisite CBF monitoring by laser-Doppler flowmetry shows that BW245C significantly increased the CBF in peri-infarct, with a significant inverse correlation between infarction and CBF. The significantly higher infarction volume in DP1−/− mice remained unchanged with BW245C treatment. Moreover, BW245C preserves hemostasis in non-stroke conditions. Combined, these data suggest that the DP1 receptor is an endogenous target that can rescue the brain following stroke by regulating CBF and hemostasis.

AB  - Abstract
The rat femoral nerve is a valuable model allowing studies on specificity of motor axon regeneration. Despite common use of this model, the functional consequences of femoral nerve lesions and their relationship to precision of axonal regeneration have not been evaluated. Here we assessed gait recovery after femoral nerve injuries of varying severity in adult female Wistar rats using a video-based approach, single-frame motion analysis (SFMA). After nerve crush, recovery was complete at 4 weeks after injury (99% of maximum 100% as estimated by a recovery index). Functional restoration after nerve section/suture was much slower and incomplete (84%) even 20 weeks post-surgery. A 5-mm gap between the distal and proximal nerve stumps additionally delayed recovery and worsened the outcome (68% recovery). As assessed by retrograde labeling in the same rats at 20 weeks after injury, the anatomical outcome was also dependent on lesion severity. After nerve crush, 97% of the femoral motoneurons (MNs) had axons correctly projecting only into the distal quadriceps branch of the femoral nerve. The percentage of correctly projecting MNs was only 55% and 15% after nerve suture and gap repair, respectively. As indicated by regression analyses, better functional recovery was associated with higher numbers of correctly projecting MNs and, unexpectedly, lower numbers of MNs projecting to both muscle and skin. The data show that type of nerve injury and repair profoundly influence selectivity of motor reinnervation and, in parallel, functional outcome. The results also suggest that MNs’ projection patterns may influence their contribution to muscle performance. In addition to the experiments described above, we performed repeated measurements and statistical analyses to validate the SFMA. The results revealed high accuracy and reproducibility of the SFMA measurements.

AB  - Abstract
Long-lasting changes in neuronal excitability require activity-dependent gene expression and therefore the transduction of synaptic signals to the nucleus. Synaptic activity is rapidly relayed to the nucleus by membrane depolarization and the propagation of Ca2+-waves. However, it is unlikely that Ca2+-transients alone can explain the specific genomic response to the plethora of extracellular stimuli that control gene expression. In recent years a steadily growing number of studies report the transport of proteins from synapse to nucleus. Potential mechanisms for active retrograde transport and nuclear targets for these proteins have been identified and recent reports assigned first functions to this type of long-distance signaling. In this review we will discuss how the dissociation of synapto-nuclear protein messenger from synaptic and extrasynaptic sites, their transport, nuclear import and the subsequent genomic response relate to the prevailing concept behind this signaling mechanism, the encoding of signals at their site of origin and their decoding in the nucleus.

AB  - Abstract
Learning to associate specific objects or actions with rewards and remembering the associations are everyday tasks crucial for our flexible adaptation to the environment. These higher-order cognitive processes depend on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and frontostriatal circuits that connect areas in the frontal lobe with the striatum in the basal ganglia. Both structures are densely innervated by dopamine (DA) afferents that originate in the midbrain. Although the activity of DA neurons is thought to be important for learning, the exact role of DA transmission in frontostriatal circuits during learning-related tasks is still unresolved. Moreover, the neural substrates of this modulation are poorly understood. Here, we review our recent work in monkeys utilizing local pharmacology of DA agents in the PFC to investigate the cellular mechanisms of DA modulation of associative learning and memory. We show that blocking both D1 and D2 receptors in the lateral PFC impairs learning of new stimulus–response associations and cognitive flexibility, but not the memory of highly familiar associations. In addition, D2 receptors may also contribute to motivation. The learning deficits correlated with reductions of neural information about the associations in PFC neurons, alterations in global excitability and spike synchronization, and exaggerated alpha and beta neural oscillations. Our findings provide new insights into how DA transmission modulates associative learning and memory processes in frontostriatal systems.

AB  - Abstract
GABAB receptors associate with Gi/o-proteins that regulate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and thus the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), there is also reported cross-regulation of phospholipase C. These associations have been studied extensively in the brain and also shown to occur in non-neural cells (e.g. human airway smooth muscle). More recently GABAB receptors have been observed in chick retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The aims were to investigate whether the GABAB receptor subunits, GABAB1 and GABAB2, are co-expressed in cultured human RPE cells, and then determine if the GABAB receptor similarly regulates the [Ca2+]i of RPE cells and if phospholipase C is involved. Human RPE cells were cultured from five donor eye cups. Evidence for GABAB1 and GABAB2 mRNAs and proteins in the RPE cell cultures was investigated using real time polymerase chain reaction, western blots and immunofluorescence. The effects of the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen, antagonist CGP46381, a Gi/o-protein inhibitor pertussis toxin, and the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 on [Ca2+]i in cultured human RPE were demonstrated using Fluo-3. Both GABAB1 and GABAB2 mRNA and protein were identified in cell cultures of human RPE; antibody staining was co-localized to the cell membrane and cytoplasm. One-hundred micromolars of baclofen caused a transient increase in the [Ca2+]i of RPE cells regardless of whether Ca2+ was added to the buffer. Baclofen-induced increases in the [Ca2+]i were attenuated by pre-treatment with CGP46381, pertussis toxin, and U73122. GABAB1 and GABAB2 are co-expressed in cell cultures of human RPE. GABAB receptors in RPE regulate the [Ca2+]i via a Gi/o-protein and phospholipase C pathway.

AB  - Abstract
The mechanisms underlying antiepileptic or antiepileptogenic effects of repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of rTMS applied during rapid amygdala kindling on some electrophysiological properties of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Male Wistar rats were kindled by daily electrical stimulation of the basolateral amygdala in a semi-rapid manner (12 stimulations/day) until they achieved stage-5 seizure. One group (kindled + rTMS (KrTMS)) of animals received rTMS (1 Hz for 4 min) 5 min after termination of daily kindling stimulations. Twenty four hours following the last kindling stimulation electrophysiological properties of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons were investigated using whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Amygdala kindling significantly depolarized the resting membrane potential and increased the input resistance, spontaneous firing activity, number of evoked spikes and half-width of the first evoked spike. Kindling also decreased the first-spike latency and amplitude significantly. Application of rTMS during kindling somehow prevented the development of seizures and protected CA1 pyramidal neurons of hippocampus against deleterious effect of kindling on both passive and active neuronal electrophysiological properties. Interestingly, application of rTMS alone enhanced the excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons significantly. Based on the results of our study, it may be suggested that rTMS exerts its anticonvulsant effect, in part, through preventing the amygdala kindling-induced changes in electrophysiological properties of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. It seems that rTMS exerts protective effects on the neural circuits involved in spreading the seizures from the focus to other parts of the brain.

AB  - Abstract
We have previously demonstrated that male rats exposed to stress during the last week of gestation present age-specific impairments of brain development. Since the organization of the fetal developing brain is subject to androgen exposure and prenatal stress was reported to disrupt perinatal testosterone surges, the aim of this research was to explore whether abnormal androgen concentrations during late gestation affects the morphology of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus (HPC) and ventral tegmental area (VTA), three major areas that were shown to be affected by prenatal stress in our previous studies. We administered 10-mg/kg/day of the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide (4′nitro-3′-trifluoromethylsobutyranilide) or vehicle injections to pregnant rats from days 15–21 of gestation. The antiandrogenic effects of flutamide were confirmed by the analysis of androgen-dependent developmental markers: flutamide-exposed rats showed reduced anogenital distance, delay in the completion of testis descent, hypospadias, cryptorchidism and atrophied seminal vesicles. Brain morphological studies revealed that prenatal flutamide decreased the number of MAP2 (a microtubule-associated protein type 2, present almost exclusively in dendrites) immunoreactive neuronal processes in all evaluated brain areas, both in prepubertal and adult offspring, suggesting that prenatal androgen disruption induces long-term reductions of the dendritic arborization of several brain structures, affecting the normal connectivity between areas. Moreover, the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunopositive neurons in the VTA of prepubertal offspring was reduced in flutamide rats but reach normal values at adulthood. Our results demonstrate that the effects of prenatal flutamide on the offspring brain morphology resemble several prenatal stress effects suggesting that the mechanism of action of prenatal stress might be related to the impairment of the organizational role of androgens on brain development.

AB  - Abstract
Past research has demonstrated that field dependence–independence (FDI) can affect academic performance, selective attention, and working memory. However, the underlying mechanism of how FDI modulates selective attention and working memory is still unclear. Using event-related potential (ERP) techniques, specifically with the contralateral delay activity (CDA), the present study found that the correct response rates and CDA amplitudes in the 2-item and 2-item–2-distractor conditions were comparable for field independence (FI) participants. Field dependence (FD) participants performed worse, and the CDA amplitude was enhanced when distractors appeared. These results indicated that FI participants can filter out task-irrelevant information more efficiently than FD participants. The main difference between FD and FI individuals is their inhibition function.

AB  - Abstract
Nitric oxide (NO) and oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation are two important factors that lead to the progression of human neurological diseases. NO can be detrimental or protective to neurons under oxidative toxicity; however, in the case of brain exposure to oxidative stress, in addition to neurons, the existence of glia may also be disturbed by toxic ROS. The influence NO will have on ROS-mediated glial injury remains unclear. Here, we examined the effects of NO on cell viability under oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in rat primary mixed glia cultures, as well as pure astroglia and microglia cultures. We found that in mixed glia cultures, both H2O2 and NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-d,l-penicillamine (SNAP) elicited cell death in a concentration-dependent manner. Combinations of H2O2 and SNAP at sublytic concentrations were sufficient to damage mixed glia, and sublytic concentrations of SNAP could reduce the insults that resulted from toxic H2O2. Furthermore, in microglia or astroglia, sublytic concentrations of H2O2 were toxic when combined with SNAP, and the potency was increased with an increased SNAP concentration. In microglia but not astroglia, a toxic H2O2-induced apoptotic injury was attenuated by a sublytic level of SNAP. H2O2 at toxic levels activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and p53 pathways and increased DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in microglia, whereas the rescue exerted by sublytic SNAP against toxic H2O2 occurred via the activation of both Akt and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascades and decreased DNA DSBs. Moreover, a sublytic concentration of SNAP induced both heat shock protein 70 and heme oxygenase-1, which may be involved in decreasing the susceptibility of microglia to H2O2 toxicity. These results suggest that NO exhibits a concentration-dependent dual action of weakening or enhancing oxidative injury in mixed glia, particularly microglia.

We employed field potential recordings in extended in vitro brain slices form Sprague-Dawley rats containing the piriform and entorhinal cortices (PC and EC, respectively) to identify the characteristics of epileptiform discharges and concomitant high-frequency oscillations (HFOs, ripples: 80–200 Hz, fast ripples: 250–500 Hz) during bath application of 4-aminopyridine (4AP, 50 μM). Ictal-like discharges occurred in PC and EC either synchronously or independently of each other; synchronous ictal discharges always emerged from a synchronous “fast” interictal background whereas asynchronous ictal discharges were preceded by a “slow” interictal event. In addition, asynchronous ictal discharges had longer duration and interval of occurrence than synchronous ictal discharges, and contained a higher proportion of ripples and fast ripples. Cutting the connections between PC and EC made synchronicity disappear and increased ictal discharges duration in the EC but failed in changing HFO occurrence in both areas. Finally, antagonizing ionotropic glutamatergic receptors abolished ictal activity in all experiments, increased the duration and rate of occurrence of interictal discharges occurring in PC-EC interconnected slices while it did not influence the slow asynchronous interictal discharges in both areas. Our results identify some novel in vitro interactions between olfactory (PC) and limbic (EC) structures that presumably contribute to in vivo ictogenesis as well.

AB  - Abstract
Animal work implicates the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in function of the ventral striatum (VS), a region known for its role in processing valenced feedback. Recent evidence in humans shows that BDNF Val66Met polymorphism modulates VS activity in anticipation of monetary feedback. However, it remains unclear whether the polymorphism impacts the processing of self-attributed feedback differently from feedback attributed to an external agent. In this study, we emphasize the importance of the feedback attribution because agency is central to computational accounts of the striatum and cognitive accounts of valence processing. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a task, in which financial gains/losses are either attributable to performance (self-attributed, SA) or chance (externally-attributed, EA) to ask whether BDNF Val66Met polymorphism predicts VS activity. We found that BDNF Val66Met polymorphism influenced how feedback valence and agency information were combined in the VS and in the right inferior frontal junction (IFJ). Specifically, Met carriers’ VS response to valenced feedback depended on agency information, while Val/Val carriers’ VS response did not. This context-specific modulation of valence effectively amplified VS responses to SA losses in Met carriers. The IFJ response to SA losses also differentiated Val/Val from Met carriers. These results may point to a reduced allocation of attention and altered motivational salience to SA losses in Val/Val compared to Met carriers. Implications for major depressive disorder are discussed.

AB  - Abstract
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) plays a role in cell signaling. It was soon proposed that ATP activates ionotropic P2X receptors, exerting an influence on neurons as well as on glial cells. In addition to the fact that the activation of P2X and P2Y receptors can stimulate or inhibit the release of glutamate from rat hippocampal neurons, the release of ATP has been implicated in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). Through different behavioral paradigms, this study aimed to investigate the participation of P2X7R in genetically modified (knockout (KO)) mice with the suppressed expression of this receptor and in the pharmacological blockage of this receptor in rats, as well as to evaluate the effect of environmental enrichment on potential mnemonic deficits. The results suggest that P2X7R participates in aversive memory processes: pharmacological blockage with the selective P2X7R antagonist, A-740003, in different time frames elicited dose-dependent impairments in memory acquisition, consolidation and retrieval in rats that were submitted to the contextual fear-conditioning (FC) task, and the deletion of P2X7R hampered the aversive memory processes of mice that were subjected to the FC paradigm. Experiments using mice that were subjected to environmental enrichment suggest that this form of stimulation reverses mnemonic impairments that are ascribed to the absence of the P2X7R, suggesting that these receptors do not participate on such a reversal. Finally, no alterations were observed in the habituation memory of P2X7KO mice.

AB  - Abstract
Experimental evidence has revealed the role of mitochondria in various aspects of neuronal physiology. Mitochondrial failure results in alterations that underlie the pathogeneses of many neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease (HD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The mitochondrial toxin 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) has been used to model failure; for example, systemic administration of 3-NP imitates the striatal degeneration that is exhibited in the postmortem tissue of patients afflicted with HD. We have demonstrated that low, sub-chronic doses of 3-NP are sufficient to initiate the damage to striatal neurons that is associated with changes in neurotrophin expression levels. However, the mechanisms underlying the alterations in neuronal activity and neurotransmission due to 3-NP-induced mitochondrial dysfunction remain to be elucidated. In this paper, we focus on how corticostriatal transmission and its modulation by neurotrophins are altered in vivo after 5 days of mitochondrial inhibition with 3-NP.

Recordings of population spikes and a paired pulse (PP) stimulation protocol were used to document changes in corticostriatal synapses in 3-NP-treated brain slices. The corticostriatal synapses were modulated by neurotrophins but displayed differential amplitude increases in the presence of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), or neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5) under control conditions. Neurotrophin-mediated synaptic modulation was decreased in slices from 3-NP-treated mice. The protein and mRNA levels of neurotrophins and their receptors were also modified in the 3-NP-treated tissue. Neuronal structural evaluation demonstrated that synaptic length and density were reduced in the 3-NP-treated mice, which partially explained the changes in the amplitudes of the synaptic field responses. Our results demonstrate that corticostriatal synapses are differentially modulated by neurotrophins and that this modulation is altered by mitochondrial failure. Mitochondrial dysfunction also affects neurotransmitter release in corticostriatal synapses, neurotrophin availability, dendritic arborization and the lengths of the striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs).

AB  - Abstract
In Parkinson’s disease (PD), elevated beta (15–35 Hz) power in subcortical motor networks is widely believed to promote aspects of PD symptomatology, moreover, a reduction in beta power and coherence accompanies symptomatic improvement following effective treatment with l-DOPA. Previous studies have reported symptomatic improvements that correlate with changes in cortical network activity following GABAA receptor modulation. In this study we have used whole-head magnetoencephalography to characterize neuronal network activity, at rest and during visually cued finger abductions, in unilaterally symptomatic PD and age-matched control participants. Recordings were then repeated following administration of sub-sedative doses of the hypnotic drug zolpidem (0.05 mg/kg), which binds to the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor. A beamforming based ‘virtual electrode’ approach was used to reconstruct oscillatory power in the primary motor cortex (M1), contralateral and ipsilateral to symptom presentation in PD patients or dominant hand in control participants. In PD patients, contralateral M1 showed significantly greater beta power than ipsilateral M1. Following zolpidem administration contralateral beta power was significantly reduced while ipsilateral beta power was significantly increased resulting in a hemispheric power ratio that approached parity. Furthermore, there was highly significant correlation between hemispheric beta power ratio and Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The changes in contralateral and ipsilateral beta power were reflected in pre-movement beta desynchronization and the late post-movement beta rebound. However, the absolute level of movement-related beta desynchronization was not altered. These results show that low-dose zolpidem not only reduces contralateral beta but also increases ipsilateral beta, while rebalancing the dynamic range of M1 network oscillations between the two hemispheres. These changes appear to underlie the symptomatic improvements afforded by low-dose zolpidem.

Work from the past 40 years has unraveled a wealth of information on the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity and their relevance in physiological brain function. At the same time, it has been recognized that a broad range of neurological diseases may be accompanied by severe alterations in synaptic plasticity, i.e., ‘maladaptive synaptic plasticity’, which could initiate and sustain the remodeling of neuronal networks under pathological conditions. Nonetheless, our current knowledge on the specific contribution and interaction of distinct forms of synaptic plasticity (including metaplasticity and homeostatic plasticity) in the context of pathological brain states remains limited. This review focuses on recent experimental evidence, which highlights the fundamental role of endoplasmic reticulum-mediated Ca2+ signals in modulating the duration, direction, extent and type of synaptic plasticity. We discuss the possibility that intracellular Ca2+ stores may regulate synaptic plasticity and hence behavioral and cognitive functions at the interface between physiology and pathology.

The C-terminal fragments-25(CTF25) of TDP-43 is a fragment of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43), which is involved in RNA metabolism, neurite outgrowth, and neuronal development and stress granules. Not until recently did evidence suggest that CTF25 might play an important role in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenesis. However, mechanical details on CTF25 causing motor neuron degeneration still remain unknown. To study the toxicity of CTF25 of TDP-43, we established a cellular model stably expressing CTF25 of TDP-43. Herein, we found that stably expressed CTF25 could induce significant oxidative stress and was mainly degraded by the proteasome pathway in cells. Furthermore, the neurotoxicity of CTF25 of TDP-43 was dependent on proteasome activity. In addition, electron microscopy showed mitochondrial swelling and cristae dilation in cells expressing CTF25 and that CTF25 aggregates were characterized by filamentous bundles and electron dense granular material. In conclusion, the new cellular model mimics classical toxic TDP-43 cellular model and interestingly the toxicity of CTF25 is dependent on the proteasome.

Empathy for pain, a widely studied sub-form of empathy, is an ability to recognize and share the pain of others. It involves brain regions associated with the emotional component of pain. Recent studies found that emotional pain could be modulated by stimulating the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). We hypothesized that tDCS of the DLPFC could modulate empathy for pain as well. In the present study, healthy subjects were asked to watch pictures depicting somebody under painful or non-painful conditions and to evaluate the pain intensity of others as well as their own pain-related unpleasantness before and after tDCS of the DLPFC. It was found that ratings for others’ pain increased in subjects with an anodal tDCS of the DLPFC in comparison to those with sham tDCS, indicating enhanced pain empathy with the anodal tDCS. Furthermore, the changes of ratings for others’ pain were positively correlated with the changes of pain-related self-unpleasantness. These findings indicate that tDCS could modulate pain empathy and be used as a potential tool for modulating diseases accompanied with empathy deficits.

AB  - Abstract
Gestational exposure to alcohol can result in long-lasting behavioral deficiencies generally described as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). FASD-modeled rodent studies of acute ethanol exposure typically select one developmental window to simulate a specific context equivalent of human embryogenesis, and study consequences of ethanol exposure within that particular developmental epoch. Exposure timing is likely a large determinant in the neurobehavioral consequence of early ethanol exposure, as each brain region is variably susceptible to ethanol cytotoxicity and has unique sensitive periods in their development. We made a parallel comparison of the long-term effects of single-day binge ethanol at either embryonic day 8 (E8) or postnatal day 7 (P7) in male and female mice, and here demonstrate the differential long-term impacts on neuroanatomy, behavior and in vivo electrophysiology of two systems with very different developmental trajectories. The significant long-term differences in odor-evoked activity, local circuit inhibition, and spontaneous coherence between brain regions in the olfacto-hippocampal pathway that were found as a result of developmental ethanol exposure, varied based on insult timing. Long-term effects on cell proliferation and interneuron cell density were also found to vary by insult timing as well as by region. Finally, spatial memory performance and object exploration were affected in P7-exposed mice, but not E8-exposed mice. Our physiology and behavioral results are conceptually coherent with the neuroanatomical data attained from these same mice. Our results recognize both variable and shared effects of ethanol exposure timing on long-term circuit function and their supported behavior.

AB  - Abstract
Despite growing interest in meditation as a tool for alternative therapy of stress-related and psychosomatic diseases, brain mechanisms of beneficial influences of meditation practice on health and quality of life are still unclear. We propose that the key point is a persistent change in emotional functioning, specifically the modulation of the early appraisal of motivational significance of events. The main aim was to study the effects of long-term meditation practice on event-related brain potentials (ERPs) during affective picture viewing. ERPs were recorded in 20 long-term Sahaja Yoga meditators and 20 control subjects without prior experience in meditation. The meditators’ mid-latency (140–400 ms) ERPs were attenuated for both positive and negative pictures (i.e. there were no arousal-related increases in ERP positivity) and this effect was more prominent over the right hemisphere. However, we found no differences in the long latency (400–800 ms) responses to emotional images, associated with meditation practice. In addition we found stronger ERP negativity in the time window 200–300 ms for meditators compared to the controls, regardless of picture valence. We assume that long-term meditation practice enhances frontal top-down control over fast automatic salience detection, based on amygdala functions.

AB  - Abstract
Timely delivery of information is essential for proper functioning of the nervous system. Precise regulation of nerve conduction velocity is needed for correct exertion of motor skills, sensory integration and cognitive functions. In vertebrates, the rapid transmission of signals along nerve fibers is made possible by the myelination of axons and the resulting saltatory conduction in between nodes of Ranvier. Myelin is a specialization of glia cells and is provided by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. Myelination not only maximizes conduction velocity, but also provides a means to systematically regulate conduction times in the nervous system. Systematic regulation of conduction velocity along axons, and thus systematic regulation of conduction time in between neural areas, is a common occurrence in the nervous system. To date, little is understood about the mechanism that underlies systematic conduction velocity regulation and conduction time synchrony. Node assembly, internode distance (node spacing) and axon diameter – all parameters determining the speed of signal propagation along axons – are controlled by myelinating glia. Therefore, an interaction between glial cells and neurons has been suggested.

This review summarizes examples of neural systems in which conduction velocity is regulated by anatomical variations along axons. While functional implications in these systems are not always clear, recent studies on the auditory system of birds and mammals present examples of conduction velocity regulation in systems with high temporal precision and a defined biological function. Together these findings suggest an active process that shapes the interaction between axons and myelinating glia to control conduction velocity along axons. Future studies involving these systems may provide further insight into how specific conduction times in the brain are established and maintained in development.

Throughout the text, conduction velocity is used for the speed of signal propagation, i.e. the speed at which an action potential travels. Conduction time refers to the time it takes for a specific signal to travel from its origin to its target, i.e. neuronal cell body to axonal terminal.

AB  - Abstract
The myelination of axons in the central nervous system (CNS) is essential for nervous system formation, function and health. CNS myelination continues well into adulthood, but not all axons become myelinated. Unlike the peripheral nervous system, where we know of numerous axon–glial signals required for myelination, we have a poor understanding of the nature or identity of such molecules that regulate which axons are myelinated in the CNS. Recent studies have started to elucidate cell behavior during myelination in vivo and indicate that the choice of which axons are myelinated is made prior to myelin sheath generation. Here we propose that interactions between axons and the exploratory processes of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) lead to myelination and may be similar to those between dendrites and axons that prefigure and lead to synapse formation. Indeed axons and OPCs form synapses with striking resemblance to those of neurons, suggesting a similar mode of formation. We discuss families of molecules with specific functions at different stages of synapse formation and address studies that implicate the same factors during axon–OPC synapse formation and myelination. We also address the possibility that the function of such synapses might directly regulate the myelinating behavior of oligodendrocyte processes in vivo. In the future it may be of benefit to consider these similarities when taking a candidate-based approach to dissect mechanisms of CNS myelination.

AB  - Abstract
Since its introduction in the early 1990s, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has played a crucial role in the non-invasive evaluation of tissue microstructure of brain parenchyma in vivo. Diffusion anisotropy, in particular, has been extensively used to infer histological changes due to brain maturation and pathology, as it shows a clear dependence on tissue architecture. Although the resolution used in most studies lies in the macroscopic range, the information provided originates at the microscopic level and, as such, diffusion MRI serves as a microscope that can reveal profound details of tissue with direct clinical and research applications. The interpretation of diffusion parameters of white matter rests on what is known to drive diffusion anisotropy, namely axonal membranes, density and coherence, as well as myelin sheaths. However, these factors interact to modulate anisotropy, making interpretations potentially difficult. While there are numerous publications that report diffusion changes in response to particular, histologically confirmed tissue abnormalities in animal models of disease, the microscopic correlates of altered diffusion parameters due to neurological disorders in humans have been difficult to characterize. Animal models may provide insight into the mechanisms involved, but do not necessarily provide accurate representations of the human condition, making human diffusion MRI studies with direct histological confirmation crucial for our understanding of tissue changes secondary to neurodevelopment and disease. This work provides a synopsis of tissue characteristics that give rise to highly informative, specific diffusion patterns, and also of how methodological and artifactual aspects can provide erroneous diffusion measurements that do not accurately reflect tissue and may lead to misinterpretation of results. Examples of diffusion changes due to human conditions are provided to illustrate the wealth of applications of diffusion MRI in clinical and research fields.

AB  - Abstract
Anxiety-related disorders are among the most common psychiatric illnesses, thought to have both genetic and environmental causes. Early-life trauma, such as abuse from a caregiver, can be predictable or unpredictable, each resulting in increased prevalence and severity of a unique set of disorders. In this study, we examined the influence of early unpredictable trauma on both the behavioral expression of adult anxiety and gene expression within the amygdala. Neonatal rats were exposed to unpaired odor-shock conditioning for 5 days, which produces deficits in adult behavior and amygdala dysfunction. In adulthood, we used the Light/Dark box test to measure anxiety-related behaviors, measuring the latency to enter the lit area and quantified urination and defecation. The amygdala was then dissected and a microarray analysis was performed to examine changes in gene expression. Animals that had received early unpredictable trauma displayed significantly longer latencies to enter the lit area and more defecation and urination. The microarray analysis revealed over-represented genes related to learning and memory, synaptic transmission and trans-membrane transport. Gene ontology and pathway analysis identified highly represented disease states related to anxiety phenotypes, including social anxiety, obsessive–compulsive disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and bipolar disorder. Addiction-related genes were also overrepresented in this analysis. Unpredictable shock during early development increased anxiety-like behaviors in adulthood with concomitant changes in genes related to neurotransmission, resulting in gene expression patterns similar to anxiety-related psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Abstract
The postsynaptic density is an electron dense meshwork composed of a variety of molecules facilitating neuronal signal transmission. ProSAP2/Shank3 represents a crucial player at postsynaptic sites, assembling large multimeric platforms and anchoring numerous other molecules, thereby linking the functional synapse with the cytoskeleton. ProSAP2/Shank3 is also implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including autism spectrum disorders. KvBeta2 (Kvβ2) on the other hand serves as a regulatory subunit of voltage-gated potassium channels. Kvβ2 is located at various sites in the neuron including the axon (binding to Kv1.2), the dendrites (binding to Kv4.2) and the synapse. Binding of Kvβ2 to either Kv1.2 or Kv4 modulates not only the channel conformation but directs targeting of the channel protein complex to distinct loci within the cell. Thus an interaction between ProSAP2 and Kvβ2 could have important roles at diverse cellular compartments and moreover during maturation stages. We report here on the direct protein–protein interaction of the postsynaptic density anchoring molecule ProSAP2 and the potassium channel subunit Kvβ2, initially identified in a yeast-two-hybrid-screen. Furthermore, we characterize this interaction at synapses using primary hippocampal neurons in vitro.

AB  - Abstract
Previous research has demonstrated that diabetes induces learning and memory deficits. However, the mechanism of memory impairment induced by diabetes is poorly understood. Dietary fatty acids, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids, have been shown to enhance learning and memory and prevent memory deficits in various experimental conditions. The present study investigated the effects of fish oil supplementation on the lipid peroxidation, inflammation and neuron apoptosis in the hippocampus of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes rats. The effects of diabetes and fish oil treatment on the spatial learning and memory were also evaluated using the Morris Water Maze. STZ-induced diabetes impaired spatial learning and memory of rats, which was associated with the inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. Fish oil administration ameliorated cognitive deficit, reduced oxidative stress and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), protected the hippocampal neurons by increasing Protein Kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation and decreasing caspase-9 expression. These results suggested that the principle mechanisms involved in the antidiabetic and neuroprotective effect of fish oil were its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptosis potential, supporting a potential role for fish oil as an adjuvant therapy for the prevention and treatment of diabetic complications.

AB  - Abstract
Voluntary exercise (VEx) has profound effects on neural and behavioral plasticity, including recovery of CNS trauma and disease. However, the unique regional cortical adaption to VEx has not been elucidated. In a series of experiments, we first examined whether VEx would restore and retain neurotrophin levels in several cortical regions (frontal cortex [FC], retrosplenial cortex [RSC], occipital cortex [OC]) in an animal model (pyrithiamine-induced thiamine deficiency [PTD]) of the amnestic disorder Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome. In addition, we assessed the time-dependent effect of VEx to rescue performance on a spontaneous alternation task. Following 2-weeks of VEx or stationary housing conditions (Stat), rats were behaviorally tested and brains were harvested either the day after VEx (24-h) or after an additional 2-week period (2-wk). In both control pair-fed (PF) rats and PTD rats, all neurotrophin levels (brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF], nerve growth factor [NGF], and vascular endothelial growth factor) increased at the 24-h period after VEx in the FC and RSC, but not OC. Two-weeks following VEx, BDNF remained elevated in both FC and RSC, whereas NGF remained elevated in only the FC. Interestingly, VEx only recovered cognitive performance in amnestic rats when there was an additional 2-wk adaptation period after VEx. Given this unique temporal profile, Experiment 2 examined the cortical cytogenetic responses in all three cortical regions following a 2-wk adaptation period after VEx. In healthy (PF) rats, VEx increased the survival of progenitor cells in both the FC and RSC, but only increased oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OLPs) in the FC. Furthermore, VEx had a selective effect of only recovering OLPs in the FC in PTD rats. These data reveal the therapeutic potential of exercise to restore cortical plasticity in the amnestic brain, and that the FC is one of the most responsive cortical regions to VEx.

AB  - Abstract
The modulatory neurotransmitter dopamine induces concentration-dependent changes in synaptic transmission in the entorhinal cortex, in which high concentrations of dopamine suppress evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and lower concentrations induce an acute synaptic facilitation. Whole-cell current-clamp recordings were used to investigate the dopaminergic facilitation of synaptic responses in layer II neurons of the rat lateral entorhinal cortex. A constant bath application of 1 μM dopamine resulted in a consistent facilitation of EPSPs evoked in layer II fan cells by layer I stimulation; the size of the facilitation was more variable in pyramidal neurons, and synaptic responses in a small group of multiform neurons were not modulated by dopamine. Isolated inhibitory synaptic responses were not affected by dopamine, and the facilitation of EPSPs was not associated with a change in paired-pulse facilitation ratio. Voltage-clamp recordings of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were facilitated by dopamine, but N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-mediated currents were not. Bath application of the dopamine D1-like receptor blocker SCH23390 (50 μM), but not the D2-like receptor blocker sulpiride (50 μM), prevented the facilitation, indicating that it is dependent upon D1-like receptor activation. Dopamine D1 receptors lead to activation of protein kinase A (PKA), and including the PKA inhibitor H-89 or KT 5720 in the recording pipette solution prevented the facilitation of EPSCs. PKA-dependent phosphorylation of inhibitor 1 or the dopamine- and cAMP-regulated protein phosphatase (DARPP-32) can lead to a facilitation of AMPA receptor responses by inhibiting the activity of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) that reduces dephosphorylation of AMPA receptors, and we found here that inhibition of PP1 occluded the facilitatory effect of dopamine. The dopamine-induced facilitation of AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic responses in layer II neurons of the lateral entorhinal cortex is therefore likely mediated via a D1 receptor-dependent increase in PKA activity and a resulting inhibition in PP1-dependent dephosphorylation of AMPA receptors.

AB  - Abstract
The dorsal hippocampus (DH) is a structure of the limbic system that is involved in emotional, learning and memory processes. There is evidence indicating that the DH modulates cardiovascular correlates of behavioral responses to stressful stimuli. Acute restraint stress (RS) is an unavoidable stress situation that evokes marked and sustained autonomic changes, which are characterized by elevated blood pressure (BP), intense heart rate (HR) increase and a decrease in cutaneous temperature. In the present study, we investigated the involvement of an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor/nitric oxide (NO) pathway of the DH in the modulation of autonomic (arterial BP, HR and tail skin temperature) responses evoked by RS in rats. Bilateral microinjection of the NMDA receptor antagonist AP-7 (10 nmol/500 nL) into the DH attenuated RS-evoked autonomic responses. Moreover, RS evoked an increase in the content of NO2/NO3 in the DH, which are products of the spontaneous oxidation of NO under physiological conditions that can provide an indirect measurement of NO production. Bilateral microinjection of N-propyl-l-arginine (0.1 nmol/500 nL; N-propyl, a neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) inhibitor) or carboxy-PTIO (2 nmol/500 nL; c-PTIO, an NO scavenger) into the DH also attenuated autonomic responses evoked by RS. Therefore, our findings suggest that a glutamatergic system present in the DH is involved in the autonomic modulation during RS, acting via NMDA receptors and nNOS activation. Furthermore, the present results suggest that NMDA receptor/nNO activation has a facilitatory influence on RS-evoked autonomic responses.

AB  - Abstract
During all stages of neural development—from the fate switches of neural precursor/progenitor cells to activity-dependent synapse maturation—chromatin-level modifications are important regulators of the gene expression that control developmental programs. Such modifications, including both alterations of histone tails and cytosine residues in the DNA, as well as changes in the chromatin structure, act dynamically throughout development and work together to determine the chromatin state at each time point. While many studies have shown localized action of chromatin modifiers at relevant gene loci, recent reports have also indicated that some chromatin modifications work on a more global scale, altering many loci throughout the genome. Here we review recent papers that describe the roles of chromatin-level regulation, at both the local and global scale, in the development of the mouse brain.

The present study characterized fetal sulcation patterns and gyrification in the cerebrum of the New World monkey group, common marmosets, using a 3D T2-weighted high-resolution anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence from the fixed brain at 7-tesla ex vivo. Fetal sulcation in the marmoset cerebrum began to indent the lateral fissure and hippocampal sulcus in gestational week (GW) 12, and then the following sulci emerged: the callosal and calcarine sulci on GW 15; the superior temporal sulcus on GW 17; and the circular and occipitotemporal sulci on GW 18. The degree of cortical convolution was evaluated quantitatively based on 2D MRI slices by the gyrification index (GI) and based on 3D MRI data by sulcation index (SI). Both the mean GI and SI increased from GW 16, and were closely correlated with the cortical volume and the cortical surface area during fetal periods (their correlation coefficients marked more than 0.95). After birth, both the mean GI and SI decreased slightly by 2 years of age, whereas the cortical volume and surface area continuously increased. Notably, histological analysis showed that the outer subventricular zone (oSVZ) in non-sulcal regions was thicker than that in the presumptive calcarine sulcal region on GW 13, preceding the infolding of the calcarine sulcus. The present results showed definite sulcal infolding on the cerebral cortical surface of the marmosets, with similar pattern and sequence of their emergences to other higher-order primates such as macaques and humans. Differential expansion of the oSVZ may be involved in gyral convolution and sulcal infolding in the developing cerebrum.

AB  - Abstract
MicroRNA (miRNA) is a small non-coding RNA that regulates gene expression by degrading target mRNAs or inhibiting translation. Although many miRNAs play important roles in various conditions, it is unclear whether miRNAs are involved in motor nerve regeneration. In this study, we identified the possible implication of miR-124 in nerve regeneration using a mouse hypoglossal nerve injury model. The significant down-regulation of miR-124 was observed in injured hypoglossal motor neurons after nerve injury, and this transient down-regulation showed a clear inverse correlation with the up-regulation of KLF6 and STAT3, known as axon elongation factor and regeneration-associated molecules, respectively. Furthermore, the luciferase assay and in vitro gain of function methods supported that both genes could be potent targets of miR-124. These results suggest that injury-induced repression of miR-124 may be implicated in the regulation of expression of several injury-associated transcription factors, which are crucial for appropriate nerve regeneration.

AB  - Developing novel therapeutics and diagnostic tools based upon an understanding of neuroplasticity is critical in order to improve the treatment and ultimately the prevention of a broad range of nervous system disorders. In the case of mood disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BPD), where diagnoses are based solely on nosology rather than pathophysiology, there exists a clear unmet medical need to advance our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms and to develop fundamentally new mechanism experimental medicines with improved efficacy. In this context, recent preclinical molecular, cellular, and behavioral findings have begun to reveal the importance of epigenetic mechanisms that alter chromatin structure and dynamically regulate patterns of gene expression that may play a critical role in the pathophysiology of mood disorders. Here, we will review recent advances involving the use of animal models in combination with genetic and pharmacological probes to dissect the underlying molecular mechanisms and neurobiological consequence of targeting this chromatin-mediated neuroplasticity. We discuss evidence for the direct and indirect effects of mood stabilizers, antidepressants, and antipsychotics, among their many other effects, on chromatin-modifying enzymes and on the epigenetic state of defined genomic loci, in defined cell types and in specific regions of the brain. These data, as well as findings from patient-derived tissue, have also begun to reveal alterations of epigenetic mechanisms in the pathophysiology and treatment of mood disorders. We summarize growing evidence supporting the notion that selectively targeting chromatin-modifying complexes, including those containing histone deacetylases (HDACs), provides a means to reversibly alter the acetylation state of neuronal chromatin and beneficially impact neuronal activity-regulated gene transcription and mood-related behaviors. Looking beyond current knowledge, we discuss how high-resolution, whole-genome methodologies, such as RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) for transcriptome analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) for analyzing genome-wide occupancy of chromatin-associated factors, are beginning to provide an unprecedented view of both specific genomic loci as well as global properties of chromatin in the nervous system. These methodologies when applied to the characterization of model systems, including those of patient-derived induced pluripotent cell (iPSC) and induced neurons (iNs), will greatly shape our understanding of epigenetic mechanisms and the impact of genetic variation on the regulatory regions of the human genome that can affect neuroplasticity. Finally, we point out critical unanswered questions and areas where additional data are needed in order to better understand the potential to target mechanisms of chromatin-mediated neuroplasticity for novel treatments of mood and other psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Abnormal gene regulation as a consequence of flawed epigenetic mechanisms may be central to the initiation and persistence of many human diseases. However, the association of epigenetic dysfunction with disease and the development of therapeutic agents for treatment are slow. Developing new methodologies used to visualize chromatin-modifying enzymes and their function in the human brain would be valuable for the diagnosis of brain disorders and drug discovery. We provide an overview of current invasive and noninvasive techniques for measuring expression and functions of chromatin-modifying enzymes in the brain, emphasizing tools applicable to histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes as a leading example. The majority of current techniques are invasive and difficult to translate to what is happening within a human brain in vivo. However, recent progress in molecular imaging provides new, noninvasive ways to visualize epigenetics in the human brain. Neuroimaging tool development presents a unique set of challenges in order to identify and validate CNS radiotracers for HDACs and other histone-modifying enzymes. We summarize advances in the effort to image HDACs and HDAC inhibitory effects in the brain using positron emission tomography (PET) and highlight generalizable techniques that can be adapted to investigate other specific components of epigenetic machinery. Translational tools like neuroimaging by PET and magnetic resonance imaging provide the best way to link our current understanding of epigenetic changes with in vivo function in normal and diseased brains. These tools will be a critical addition to ex vivo methods to evaluate – and intervene – in CNS dysfunction.

AB  - Abstract
The nervous system of higher organisms is characterized by an enormous diversity of cell types that function in concert to carry out a myriad of neuronal functions. Differences in connectivity, and subsequent physiology of the connected neurons, are a result of differences in transcriptional programs. The extraordinary complexity of the nervous system requires an equally complex regulatory system. It is well established that transcription factor combinations and the organization of cis-regulatory sequences control commitment to differentiation programs and preserve a nuclear plasticity required for neuronal functions. However, an additional level of regulation is provided by epigenetic controls. Among various epigenetic processes, nuclear organization and the control of genome architecture emerge as an efficient and powerful form of gene regulation that meets the unique needs of the post-mitotic neuron. Here, we present an outline of how nuclear architecture affects transcription and provide examples from the recent literature where these principles are used by the nervous system.

AB  - Abstract
Noradrenaline acting via β-adrenoceptors (β-ARs) in the CNS plays an important role in learning/memory and cognitive functions. β-ARs have been shown to be expressed in cortical pyramidal and subcortical principal cells. However, little is known about β-AR expression in different subtypes of GABAergic neurons. Here, we report that both β1- and β2-ARs are expressed in a majority of GABAergic interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex of mice, including parvalbumin (PV)-, calretinin (CR)-, calbindin D-28k (CB)-, somatostatin (SST)- and Reelin-immunoreactive (ir) interneurons. Relative to PV-, CB-, SST- and Reelin-ir interneurons, CR-ir interneurons are less likely to express β1- and β2-ARs. SST-ir interneurons are more likely to express β2-AR compared with the other subtypes of interneurons. The present results are of significance for understanding the role of β-ARs in prefrontal cortical functions.

AB  - Abstract
Our previous study has shown that aging and hypertension may alter apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) and increase ischemic susceptibility in the non-ischemic rat brain. The present study wishes to further investigate whether aging and hypertension may influence cerebral diffusion/perfusion and increase ischemic susceptibility in the ischemic brain. Brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was examined 1 day before and 1 and 7 days after bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. Young and middle-aged normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats and young and middle-aged spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were studied. Infarction occurred mainly in the parietal cortex and was larger in middle-aged SHRs than the other three groups (P &lt; 0.05). In pre-operation, ADC was higher and CBF was lower in middle-aged/hypertensive rats than young/normotensive rats (P &lt; 0.05). The ADC was higher in the parietal cortex of the rats with infarction at 7 days when compared to the rats without infarction [receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), P = 0.001; binary logistic regression (BLR), P = 0.006]. However, there was no difference in the hippocampus and thalamus. At day 1 post-operation, CBF reduced and ADC/CBF ratio elevated significantly in the parietal cortex of the rats with infarction when compared to the rats without infarction (CBF: ROC, P = 0.002; BLR, P = 0.017. ADC/CBF ratio: ROC, P = 0.001; BLR, P = 0.018). Our results demonstrated that pre-operation ADC and post-operation CBF and ADC/CBF ratio can be used as good MR markers in the prediction of ischemic susceptibility after cerebral hypoperfusion.

AB  - Abstract
Progesterone is a known anticonvulsant, with its inhibitory effects generally attributed to its secondary metabolite, 5α,3α-tetrahydroprogesterone (THP), and THP’s enhancement of GABAA receptor activity. Accumulating evidence, however, suggests that progesterone may have non-genomic actions independent of the GABAA receptor. In this study, we explored THP/GABAA-independent anticonvulsive actions of progesterone in a mouse model of hippocampal kindling and in mouse entorhinal slices in vitro. Specifically, we examined the effects of progesterone in kindled mice with or without pretreatments with finasteride, a 5α-reductase inhibitor known to block the metabolism of progesterone to THP. In addition, we examined the effects of progesterone on entorhinal epileptiform potentials in the presence of a GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin and finasteride.

Adult male mice were kindled via a daily stimulation protocol. Electroencephalographic (EEG) discharges were recorded from the hippocampus or cortex to assess “focal” or “generalized” seizure activity. Kindled mice were treated with intra-peritoneal injections of progesterone (10, 35, 100 and 160 mg/kg) with or without finasteride pretreatment (50 or 100 mg/kg), THP (1, 3.5, 10 and 30 mg/kg), midazolam (2 mg/kg) and carbamazepine (50 mg/kg). Entorhinal cortical slices were prepared from naïve young mice, and repetitive epileptiform potentials were induced by 4-aminopyridine (100 μM), picrotoxin (100 μM) and finasteride (1 μM).

Pretreatment with finasteride did not abolish the anticonvulsant effects of progesterone. In finasteride-pretreated mice, progesterone at 100 and 160 mg/kg decreased cortical but not hippocampal afterdischarges (ADs). Carbamazepine mimicked the effects of progesterone with finasteride pretreatments in decreasing cortical discharges and motor seizures, whereas midazolam produced effects similar to progesterone alone or THP in decreasing hippocampal ADs and motor seizures. In brain slices, progesterone at 1 μM inhibited entorhinal epileptiform potentials in the presence of picrotoxin and finasteride.

We suggest that progesterone may have THP/GABAA-dependent and independent anticonvulsive actions in the hippocampal-kindled mouse model.

AB  - Abstract
β-Amyloid (Aβ) accumulation has been proved to be responsible for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, it is not yet clear what makes Aβ accumulate and become toxic in the AD brains. Our previous studies demonstrated that glycated Aβ (Aβ-AGE) could be formed, and it exacerbated the authentic Aβ-mediated neurotoxicity in vitro, but we did not show the role of Aβ-AGE in vivo and the underlying mechanism. In the current study, we synthesized Aβ-AGE by incubating Aβ with methylglyoxal in vitro, and then stereotactically injected Aβ-AGE into lateral ventricle of Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats. We found that Aβ-AGE aggravated Aβ-induced cognitive impairment, which was characterized by higher speed of deterioration of long-term potentiation (LTP), more decrease of dendritic spines density and more down-regulation of synaptic proteins. We also observed the overexpression of receptor for advanced glycation endproducts receptor for AGEs (RAGE) and the activation of downstream molecular (GSK3, NF-κB, p38) in RAGE-mediated pathways. On the other hand, simultaneous application of RAGE antibody or GSK3 inhibitor LiCl reversed the cognitive decline amplified by Aβ-AGE. Our data revealed that in vivo the Aβ-AGE is more toxic than Aβ, and Aβ-AGE could lead to the aggravation of AD-like pathology though the RAGE pathway, suggesting that Aβ-AGE and RAGE may be new therapeutic targets for AD.

AB  - Abstract
Many types of injury such as seizure, ischemia, and oxidative stress cause upregulation of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) in brain neurons, where it promotes apoptosis, however the mechanism by which p75NTR is regulated under these conditions is not well understood. Proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) are highly produced under these injury conditions and, in particular, are expressed rapidly in the rat hippocampus after seizure. IL-1β is known to increase neuronal vulnerability under many conditions, although it does not directly induce neuronal death. Recently, we have shown that these cytokines regulate p75NTR induction both in neurons and astrocytes in vitro. Here, we show that IL-1β infusion into the brain induces p75NTR in neurons of the CA1 area of the hippocampus. While IL-1β induction of p75NTR is not sufficient to induce cell death, we demonstrate that IL-1β primes the neurons by recruiting p75NTR and its coreceptor sortilin to the cell surface, making the neurons more vulnerable to subsequent challenge by proNGF. These results suggest a mechanism by which IL-1β exacerbates neuronal death following injury.

AB  - Abstract
The interaction between neurons, astrocytes and endothelial cells plays a central role coupling energy supply with changes in neuronal activity. For a long time it was believed that glucose was the only source of energy for neurons. However, a growing body of experimental evidence indicates that lactic acid, generated by aerobic glycolysis in perivascular astrocytes, is also a source of energy for neuronal activity, particularly when the supply of glucose from the intravascular space is interrupted. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an evolutionary conserved kinase that couples cellular activity with energy consumption via induction of the uptake of glucose and activation of the glycolytic pathway. The uptake of glucose by the blood–brain barrier is mediated by glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1), which is abundantly expressed in endothelial cells and astrocytic end-feet processes. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) is a serine proteinase that is found in endothelial cells, astrocytes and neurons. Genetic overexpression of neuronal tPA or treatment with recombinant tPA protects neurons from the deleterious effects of metabolic stress or excitotoxicity, via a mechanism independent of tPA’s ability to cleave plasminogen into plasmin. The work presented here shows that exposure to metabolic stress induces the rapid release of tPA from murine neurons but not from astrocytes. This tPA induces AMPK activation, membrane recruitment of GLUT1, and GLUT1-mediated glucose uptake in astrocytes and endothelial cells. Our data indicate that this is followed by the synthesis and release of lactic acid from astrocytes, and that the uptake of this lactic acid via the monocarboxylate transporter-2 promotes survival in neurons exposed to metabolic stress.

AB  - Abstract
Clinical studies have shown that agonist–antagonist opioid analgesics that produce their analgesic effect via action on the kappa-opioid receptor, produce a delayed-onset anti-analgesia in men but not women, an effect blocked by co-administration of a low dose of naloxone. We now report the same time-dependent anti-analgesia and its underlying mechanism in an animal model. Using the Randall–Selitto paw-withdrawal assay in male rats, we found that nalbuphine, pentazocine, and butorphanol each produced analgesia during the first hour followed by anti-analgesia starting at ∼90 min after administration in males but not females, closely mimicking its clinical effects. As observed in humans, co-administration of nalbuphine with naloxone in a dose ratio of 12.5:1 blocked anti-analgesia but not analgesia. Administration of the highly selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist U69593 produced analgesia without subsequent anti-analgesia, and confirmed by the failure of the selective kappa antagonist nor-binaltorphimine to block nalbuphine-induced anti-analgesia, indicating that anti-analgesia is not mediated by kappa-opioid receptors. We therefore tested the role of other receptors in nalbuphine anti-analgesia. Nociceptin/orphanin FQ (NOP) and sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors were chosen on the basis of their known anti-analgesic effects and receptor binding studies. The selective NOP receptor antagonists, JTC801, and J-113397, but not the sigma receptor antagonist, BD 1047, antagonized nalbuphine anti-analgesia. Furthermore, the NOP receptor agonist NNC 63-0532 produced anti-analgesia with the same delay in onset observed with the three agonist–antagonists, but without producing preceding analgesia and this anti-analgesia was also blocked by naloxone. These results strongly support the suggestion that clinically used agonist–antagonists act at the NOP receptor to produce anti-analgesia.

AB  - Abstract
Our previous study demonstrated that chronic prenatal methamphetamine (MA) exposure and a single dose of MA in adulthood decrease focally induced epileptiform activity in adult male rats. As seizures are known to be dependent on sex and female estrous cycle, the goal of the present study was to examine the combined effect of prenatal MA exposure (5 mg/kg) and the MA challenge dose (1 mg/kg) in adulthood on electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and consequences of brain stimulation in freely moving adult female rats with respect to the estrous cycle. Overall, 12 groups of adult female rats were tested: prenatally MA-exposed, prenatally saline-exposed and rats without prenatal injections, each of these groups was either postnatally challenged with MA or with saline injection (MA–MA, MA–S; S–MA, S–S; C–MA, C–S) and further divided according to the stage of the estrous cycle to metestrus/diestrus (M/D) or proestrus/estrus (P/E). Seizures were induced by repetitive electrical stimulation (15 s/8 Hz) of sensorimotor cortex. Stimulation threshold, duration of afterdischarges (ADs), and presence and duration of spontaneous ADs (SADs) were evaluated. Additionally, behavior associated with stimulation and ADs, and occurrence of wet-dog-shakes (WDS) were analyzed. The present study demonstrates that the prenatal MA exposure decreased the seizure threshold in females in M/D, but not in females in P/E. In addition, prenatally MA-exposed M/D females injected with saline in adulthood had increased the duration of ADs as well as SADs. The challenge dose of MA also decreased the seizure threshold. Moreover, prenatal as well as adult MA administration decreased the number and occurrence of WDS, respectively. Thus, the present study demonstrates that the effect of prenatal MA exposure and challenge dose of the same drug on focally induced epileptiform activity in adult female rats depends on the estrous cycle.

Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) supports and maintains the neuromuscular system during development and through adulthood by promoting neuroplasticity. The aim of this study was to determine if different modes of exercise can promote changes in GDNF expression and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) morphology in slow- and fast-twitch muscles. Rats were randomly assigned to a run training (run group), swim training (swim group), or sedentary control group. GDNF protein content was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. GDNF protein content increased significantly in soleus (SOL) following both training protocols (P &lt; 0.05). Although not significant, an increase of 60% in the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) followed swim-training (NS; P &lt; 0.06). NMJ morphology was analyzed by measuring α-bungarotoxin labeled post-synaptic end plates. GDNF content and total end plate area were positively correlated. End plate area decreased in EDL of the run group and increased in SOL of the swim group. The results indicate that GDNF expression and NMJ morphological changes are activity dependent and that different changes may be observed by varying the exercise intensity in slow- and fast-twitch fibers.

AB  - Abstract
The spiral ganglion conveys afferent auditory information predominantly through a single class of type I neurons that receive signals from inner hair cell sensory receptors. These auditory primary afferents, like in other systems (Puopolo and Belluzzi, 1998; Gascon and Moqrich, 2010; Leao et al., 2012) possess a marked diversity in their electrophysiological features (Taberner and Liberman, 2005). Consistent with these observations, when the auditory primary afferents were assessed in neuronal explants separated from their peripheral and central targets it was found that individual neurons were markedly heterogeneous in their endogenous electrophysiological features. One aspect of this heterogeneity, obvious throughout the ganglion, was their wide range of excitability as assessed by voltage threshold measurements (Liu and Davis, 2007). Thus, while neurons in the base differed significantly from apical and middle neurons in their voltage thresholds, each region showed distinctly wide ranges of values. To determine whether the resting membrane potentials (RMPs) of these neurons correlate with the threshold distribution and to identify the ion channel regulatory elements underlying heterogeneous neuronal excitability in the ganglion, patch-clamp recordings were made from postnatal day (P5–8) murine spiral ganglion neurons in vitro. We found that RMP mirrored the tonotopic threshold distribution, and contributed an additional level of heterogeneity in each cochlear location. Pharmacological experiments further indicated that threshold and RMP was coupled through the Kv1 current, which had a dual impact on both electrophysiological parameters. Whereas, hyperpolarization-activated cationic channels decoupled these two processes by primarily affecting RMP without altering threshold level. Thus, beyond mechanical and synaptic specializations, ion channel regulation of intrinsic membrane properties imbues spiral ganglion neurons with different excitability levels, a feature that contributes to primary auditory afferent diversity.

AB  - The foundations of brain architecture are established early in life through a continuous series of dynamic interactions in which environmental conditions and personal experiences have a significant impact on how genetic predispositions are expressed. New scientific research shows that early social experiences can actually influence how genes are expressed. Thus, the old-school concepts that genes are “chiseled in stone” or that they alone determine development have been disproven. The discovery of the epigenome provides an explanation, at the molecular level, for why and how early positive and negative social experiences give rise to a biological memory that can have lifelong impacts. Signatures associated with the epigenome can be temporary or permanent, affect multiple organ systems, and increase the risk not only for poor physical and mental health outcomes but also for impairments in future learning capacity and behavior. Here, we focus on recent evidence for a role of epigenetic DNA modifications as a potential mechanism that explains how early social life experiences become embedded in the circuitry of the developing brain and are associated with lifelong consequences.

AB  - From fertilization throughout development and until death, cellular programs in individual cells are dynamically regulated to fulfill multiple functions ranging from cell lineage specification to adaptation to internal and external stimuli. Such regulation is of major importance in brain cells, because the brain continues to develop long after birth and incorporates information from the environment across life. When compromised, these regulatory mechanisms can have detrimental consequences on neurodevelopment and lead to severe brain pathologies and neurodegenerative diseases in the adult individual. Elucidating these processes is essential to better understand their implication in disease etiology. Because they are strongly influenced by environmental factors, they have been postulated to depend on epigenetic mechanisms. This review describes recent studies that have identified epigenetic dysfunctions in the pathophysiology of several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. It discusses currently known pathways and molecular targets implicated in pathologies including imprinting disorders, Rett syndrome, and Alzheimer′s, Parkinson′s and Hungtinton′s disease, and their relevance to these diseases.

AB  - Abstract
Childhood maltreatment (CM) has estimated prevalence among Western societies between 10% and 15%. As CM associates with increased risk of several psychiatric disorders, early age of illness onset, increased comorbidity and negative clinical outcome, it imposes a major public health, social and economic impact. Although the clinical consequences of CM are well characterized, a major challenge remains to understand how negative early-life events can affect brain function over extended periods of time. We review here both animal and human studies indicating that the epigenetic mechanism of DNA methylation is a crucial mediator of early-life experiences, thereby maintaining life-long neurobiological sequelae of CM, and strongly determining psychopathological risk.

AB  - Abstract
The human brain has a remarkable capacity to adapt to and learn from a wide range of variations in the environment. However, environmental challenges can also precipitate psychiatric disorders in susceptible individuals. Why any given experience should induce one brain to adapt while another is edged toward psychopathology remains poorly understood. Like all aspects of psychological function, both nature (genetics) and nurture (life experience) sculpt the brain’s response to stressful stimuli. Here we review how these two influences intersect at the epigenetic regulation of neuronal gene transcription, and we discuss how the regulation of genomic DNA methylation near key stress-response genes may influence psychological susceptibility or resilience to environmental stressors. Our goal is to offer a perspective on the epigenetics of stress responses that works to bridge the gap between the study of this molecular process in animal models and its potential usefulness for understanding stress vulnerabilities in humans.

AB  - Abstract
Genetic factors are implicated in the heritability of drug abuse. However, even with advances in current technology no specific genes have been identified that are critical for the transmission of drug-induced phenotypes to subsequent generations. It is now evident that epigenetic factors contribute to disease heritability and represent a link between genes and the environment. Recently, epigenetic mechanisms have been shown to underlie drug-induced structural, synaptic, and behavioral plasticity by coordinating the expression of gene networks within the brain. Therefore, the epigenome provides a direct mechanism for drugs of abuse to influence the genetic events involved in the development of addiction as well as its heritability to subsequent generations. In this review we discuss the mechanisms underlying intergenerational epigenetic transmission, highlight studies that demonstrate this phenomenon with particular attention to the field of addiction, and identify gaps for future studies.

AB  - Abstract
Experimental and epidemiological evidence reveal the profound influence that industrialized modern society has imposed on human social habits and physiology during the past 50 years. This drastic change in life-style is thought to be one of the main causes of modern diseases including obesity, type 2 diabetes, mental illness such as depression, sleep disorders, and certain types of cancer. These disorders have been associated to disruption of the circadian clock, an intrinsic time-keeper molecular system present in virtually all cells and tissues. The circadian clock is a key element in homeostatic regulation by controlling a large array of genes implicated in cellular metabolism. Importantly, intimate links between epigenetic regulation and the circadian clock exist and are likely to prominently contribute to the plasticity of the response to the environment. In this review, we summarize some experimental and epidemiological evidence showing how environmental factors such as stress, drugs of abuse and changes in circadian habits, interact through different brain areas to modulate the endogenous clock. Furthermore we point out the pivotal role of the deacetylase silent mating-type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1) as a molecular effector of the environment in shaping the circadian epigenetic landscape.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been increasingly appreciated as an integral component of gene regulatory networks. Genome-wide features of their origin and expression patterns ascribed a prominent role for lncRNAs to the regulation of protein-coding genes, and also suggest a potential link to many human diseases. Recent studies have begun to unravel the intricate regulatory mechanism of lncRNAs occurring at multiple levels. The brain is one of the richest sources of lncRNAs, many of which have already shown a close relationship with genes or genetic loci implicated in a wide range of neurological disorders. This review describes recently emerging mechanistic principles of lncRNA functions to provide neuroscientists with molecular insights that will help future research on lncRNAs in the brain.

AB  - Abstract
Puberty is a critical period of development during which the reemergence of gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion from the hypothalamus triggers a cascade of hormone-dependent processes. Maturation of specific brain regions including the prefrontal cortex occurs during this window, but the complex mechanisms underlying these dynamic changes are not well understood. Particularly, the potential involvement of epigenetics in this programming has been under-examined. The epigenome is known to guide earlier stages of development, and it is similarly poised to regulate vital pubertal-driven brain maturation. Further, as epigenetic machinery is highly environmentally responsive, its involvement may also lend this period of growth to greater vulnerability to external insults, resulting in reprogramming and increased disease risk. Importantly, neuropsychiatric diseases commonly present in individuals during or immediately following puberty, and environmental perturbations including stress may precipitate disease onset by disrupting the normal trajectory of pubertal brain development via epigenetic mechanisms. In this review, we discuss epigenetic processes involved in pubertal brain maturation, the potential points of derailment, and the importance of future studies for understanding this dynamic developmental window and gaining a better understanding of neuropsychiatric disease risk.

AB  - Two major environmental developments have occurred in mammalian evolution which have impacted on the genetic and epigenetic regulation of brain development. The first of these was viviparity and development of the placenta which placed a considerable burden of time and energy investment on the matriline, and which resulted in essential hypothalamic modifications. Maternal feeding, maternal care, parturition, milk letdown and the suspension of fertility and sexual behaviour are all determined by the maternal hypothalamus and have evolved to meet foetal needs under the influence of placental hormones. Viviparity itself provided a new environmental variable for selection pressures to operate via the co-existence over three generations of matrilineal genomes (mother, developing offspring and developing oocytes) in one individual. Also of importance for the matriline has been the evolution of epigenetic marks (imprint control regions) which are heritable and undergo reprogramming primarily in the oocyte to regulate imprinted gene expression according to parent of origin. Imprinting of autosomal genes has played a significant role in mammalian evolutionary development, particularly that of the hypothalamus and placenta. Indeed, many imprinted genes that are co-expressed in the placenta and hypothalamus play an important role in the co-adapted functioning of these organs. Thus the action and interaction of two genomes (maternal and foetal) have provided a template for transgenerational selection pressures to operate in shaping the mothering capabilities of each subsequent generation.

The advanced aspects of neocortical brain evolution in primates have emancipated much of behaviour from the determininIBROg effects of hormonal action. Thus in large brain primates, most of the sexual behaviour is not reproductive hormone dependent and maternal care can and does occur outside the context of pregnancy and parturition. The neocortex has evolved to be adaptable and while the adapted changes are not inherited, the epigenetic predisposing processes can be. This provides each generation with the same ability to generate new adaptations while retaining a “cultural” predisposition to retain others. A significant evolutionary contribution to this epigenetic dimension has again been the matriline. The extensive neocortical development which takes place post-natally does so in an environment which is predominantly that of the caring guidance of the mother.

Evidence for the epigenetic regulation of neocortical development is best illustrated by the GABA-ergic neurons and their long tangential migratory pathway from the ganglionic eminence, in contrast to the radial migration of principle neurons. GABA-ergic neurons play an integral role both in the developmental formation of canonical localised circuits and in synchronising widespread functional activity by the regulation of network oscillations. Such synchronisation enables distributed regions of the neocortex to coordinate firing. GABA-ergic dysfunction contributes to a broad spectrum of neurological and psychiatric disorders which can differ even across identical monozygotic twins. Moreover, major treatments for schizophrenia over the past 40 years have included the drugs lithium and valproate, both of which we now know are histone deacetylases. It is rarely the heritable dysfunctioning of these epigenetic mechanisms that is at fault, but the timing, duration and place where they are deployed. The timing and complexity in the development of the neocortex makes this region of the brain more vulnerable to perturbations.

AB  - Chronic exposure to stress is associated with a number of psychiatric disorders, but little is known about the epigenetic mechanisms that underlie the stress response or resilience to chronic stress. We investigated histone acetylation in seven different brain regions of rats exposed to chronic social defeat stress: the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC), ventral hippocampus (vHPC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA), locus coeruleus (LC), paraventricular thalamus (PVT), and dorsal raphe (DR) nucleus. This stress paradigm was unique in that it allowed rats to display resilience in the form of an active coping mechanism. We found that there was an increase in acetylation of H3K9/14 (H3K9/14ac) and bulk acetylation of H4K5,8,12,16 (H4K5,8,12,16ac) in the DR nucleus of rats that were less resilient. Less resilient rats also displayed increased levels of H3K18 acetylation (H3K18ac) in the mPFC when compared to non-stressed controls. In the vHPC, there was an increase in H3K18ac and H4K12 (H4K12ac) in rats that were less resilient when compared to non-stressed control rats. In addition, there was a decrease in levels of H4K8 acetylation (H4K8ac) in both resilient and non-resilient rats as compared to controls. We assessed expression of histone modifying enzymes in the vHPC and the mPFC using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and found changes in expression of a number of targets. These included changes in Sirt1 and Sirt2 in the vHPC and changes in Kat5 in the mPFC. Overall, these results suggest that changes in histone acetylation and expression of histone modifying enzymes in these regions correlate with the behavioral response to stress in socially defeated rats.

AB  - Abstract
A large, and still rapidly expanding literature on epigenetic regulation in the nervous system has provided fundamental insights into the dynamic regulation of DNA methylation and post-translational histone modifications in the context of neuronal plasticity in health and disease. Remarkably, however, very little is known about the potential role of chromatin-bound RNAs, including many long non-coding transcripts and various types of small RNAs. Here, we provide an overview on RNA-mediated regulation of chromatin structure and function, with focus on histone lysine methylation and psychiatric disease. Examples of recently discovered chromatin-bound long non-coding RNAs important for neuronal health and function include the brain-derived neurotrophic factor antisense transcript (Bdnf-AS) which regulates expression of the corresponding sense transcript, and LOC389023 which is associated with human-specific histone methylation signatures at the chromosome 2q14.1 neurodevelopmental risk locus by regulating expression of DPP10, an auxillary subunit for voltage-gated K(+) channels. We predict that the exploration of chromatin-bound RNA will significantly advance our current knowledge base in neuroepigenetics and biological psychiatry.

Recent advances in genomic technologies have allowed for tremendous progress in our understanding of the biology underlying medulloblastoma, a malignant childhood brain tumor. Consensus molecular subgroups have been put forth by the pediatric neuro-oncology community and next-generation genomic studies have led to an improved description of driver genes and pathways somatically altered in these subgroups. In contrast to the impressive pace at which advances have been made at the level of the medulloblastoma genome, comparable studies of the epigenome have lagged behind. Complementary data yielded from genomic sequencing and copy number profiling have verified frequent targeting of chromatin modifiers in medulloblastoma, highly suggestive of prominent epigenetic deregulation in the disease. Past studies of DNA methylation-dependent gene silencing and microRNA expression analyses further support the concept of medulloblastoma as an epigenetic disease. In this Review, we aim to summarize the key findings of past reports pertaining to medulloblastoma epigenetics as well as recent and ongoing genomic efforts linking somatic alterations of the genome with inferred deregulation of the epigenome. In addition, we predict what is on the horizon for medulloblastoma epigenetics and how aberrant changes in the medulloblastoma epigenome might serve as an attractive target for future therapies.

AB  - While the importance of epigenetic mechanisms is well established for numerous aspects of cell differentiation and development, recent findings have shown epigenetic processes to be a critical regulatory component in postmitotic neurons. Particularly intriguing, and potentially significant, are data demonstrating epigenetic regulation of cognitive behaviors. Different aspects of learning and memory appear to be regulated at the level of epigenetic chromatin modifications. Furthermore, it is becoming clear that the dysfunction of epigenetic mechanisms can lead to various disorders accompanied by significant mental impairment. Here, we review the evidence for the epigenetic control of cognition and the role of epigenetic dysregulation in mental disorders. A better understanding of epigenetic mechanisms will increase our fundamental knowledge of cognition and also provide new and exciting avenues of treatment for various mental disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Epidemiological studies have shown significant results in the interaction between the functions of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and 5-HT in mood disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD). The latest research has provided convincing evidence that gene transcription of these molecules is a target for epigenetic changes, triggered by stressful stimuli that starts in early childhood and continues throughout life, which are subsequently translated into structural and functional phenotypes culminating in depressive disorders. The short variants of 5-HTTLPR and BDNF-Met are seen as forms which are predisposed to epigenetic aberrations, which leads individuals to a susceptibility to environmental adversities, especially when subjected to stress in early life. Moreover, the polymorphic variants also feature epistatic interactions in directing the functional mechanisms elicited by stress and underlying the onset of depressive disorders. Also emphasized are works which show some mediators between stress and epigenetic changes of the 5-HTT and BDNF genes, such as the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which is a cellular transcription factor. Both the HPA axis and CREB are also involved in epistatic interactions between polymorphic variants of 5-HTTLPR and Val66Met.

This review highlights some research studying changes in the epigenetic patterns intrinsic to genes of 5-HTT and BDNF, which are related to lifelong environmental adversities, which in turn increases the risks of developing MDD.

Motor skill can be improved with mental simulation. Implements are widely used in daily life and in various sports. However, it is unclear whether the utilization of implements enhances the effect of mental simulation. The present study was designed to investigate the different effects of motor imagery in athletes and novices when they handled a specific implement. We hypothesize that athletes have better motor imagery ability than novices when they hold a specific implement for the sport. This is manifested as higher motor cortical excitability in athletes than novices during motor imagery with the specific implement. Sixteen expert badminton players and 16 novices were compared when they held a specific implement such as a badminton racket and a non-specific implement such as a a plastic bar. Motor imagery ability was measured with a self-evaluation questionnaire. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to test the motor cortical excitability during motor imagery. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and extensor carpi radialis muscles were recorded. Athletes reported better motor imagery than novices when they held a specific implement. Athletes exhibited more MEP facilitation than novices in the FDI muscle with the specific implement applied during motor imagery. The MEP facilitation is correlated with motor imagery ability in athletes. We conclude that the effects of motor imagery with a specific implement are enhanced in athletes compared to novices and the difference between two groups is caused by long-term physical training of athletes with the specific implement.

AB  - Abstract
Groove-based rhythm is a basic and much appreciated feature of Western popular music. It is commonly associated with dance, movement and pleasure and is characterized by the repetition of a basic rhythmic pattern. At various points in the musical course, drum breaks occur, representing a change compared to the repeated pattern of the groove. In the present experiment, we investigated the brain response to such drum breaks in a repetitive groove. Participants were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while listening to a previously unheard naturalistic groove with drum breaks at uneven intervals. The rhythmic pattern and the timing of its different parts as performed were the only aspects that changed from the repetitive sections to the breaks. Differences in blood oxygen level-dependent activation were analyzed. In contrast to the repetitive parts, the drum breaks activated the left cerebellum, the right inferior frontal gyrus (RIFG), and the superior temporal gyri (STG) bilaterally. A tapping test using the same stimulus showed an increase in the standard deviation of inter-tap-intervals in the breaks versus the repetitive parts, indicating extra challenges for auditory-motor integration in the drum breaks. Both the RIFG and STG have been associated with structural irregularity and increase in musical-syntactical complexity in several earlier studies, whereas the left cerebellum is known to play a part in timing. Together these areas may be recruited in the breaks due to a prediction error process whereby the internal model is being updated. This concurs with previous research suggesting a network for predictive feed-forward control that comprises the cerebellum and the cortical areas that were activated in the breaks.

AB  - Abstract
Successful emotion regulation is a fundamental prerequisite for well-being and dysregulation may lead to psychopathology. The ability to inhibit spontaneous emotions while behaving in accordance with desired goals is an important dimension of emotion regulation and can be measured using emotional conflict resolution tasks. Few studies have investigated the gray matter correlates underlying successful emotional conflict resolution at the whole-brain level. We had 190 adults complete an emotional conflict resolution task (face-word task) and examined the brain regions significantly correlated with successful emotional conflict resolution using voxel-based morphometry. We found successful emotional conflict resolution was associated with increased regional gray matter density in widely distributed brain regions. These regions included the dorsal anterior cingulate/dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, ventral medial prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor area, amygdala, ventral striatum, precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, inferior parietal lobule, superior temporal gyrus and fusiform face area. Together, our results indicate that individual differences in emotional conflict resolution ability may be attributed to regional structural differences across widely distributed brain regions.

AB  - Abstract
Aging is associated with exacerbated brain injury after ischemic stroke. Herein, we explored the possible mechanisms underlying the age-associated exacerbated brain injury after ischemic stroke and determined whether therapeutic intervention with anesthetic post-conditioning would provide neuroprotection in aged rats. Male Fisher 344 rats (young, 4 months; aged, 24 months) underwent 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 24-h reperfusion, with or without sevoflurane post-conditioning for 15 min immediately at the onset of reperfusion. Compared with young rats, aged rats showed larger infarct size, worse neurological scores and more TUNEL-positive cells in the penumbral cerebral cortex at 24 h after MCAO. However, edema formation and motor coordination were similar in both groups. Sevoflurane reduced the infarct size, edema formation, and TUNEL-positive cells, and improved the neurological outcome in young rats but not in aged rats. Molecular studies revealed that basal expression of the anti-apoptotic molecule B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) in the brain was lower in aged rats compared with young rats before MCAO, while basal expression of the pro-apoptotic molecule Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) showed similar levels in both groups. MCAO reduced Bcl-2 expression and increased Bax expression in both groups; however, Bax increase was more pronounced in aged rats. In young rats, sevoflurane reversed the above MCAO-induced changes. In contrast, sevoflurane failed to enhance Bcl-2 expression but decreased Bax expression in aged rats. These findings suggest that aging-associated reduction in basal Bcl-2 expression in the brain contributes to increased neuronal injury by enhancing cell apoptosis after ischemic stroke. Sevoflurane post-conditioning failed to provide neuroprotection in aged rats, probably due to its inability to increase Bcl-2 levels and prevent apoptosis in the brain.

AB  - Abstract
The brains of diving mammals are repeatedly exposed to hypoxic conditions during diving. Brain neurons of the hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) have been shown to be more hypoxia tolerant than those of mice, but the underlying mechanisms are not clear. Here we investigated the roles of different metabolic substrates for maintenance of neuronal activity and integrity, by comparing the in vitro spontaneous neuronal activity of brain slices from layer V of the visual cortex of hooded seals with those in mice (Mus musculus). Studies were conducted by manipulating the composition of the artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), containing either 10 mM glucose, or 20 mM lactate, or no external carbohydrate supply (aglycemia). Normoxic, hypoxic and ischemic conditions were applied. The lack of glucose or the application of lactate in the aCSF containing no glucose had little effect on the neuronal activity of seal neurons in either normoxia or hypoxia, while neurons from mice survived in hypoxia only few minutes regardless of the composition of the aCSF. We propose that seal neurons have higher intrinsic energy stores. Indeed, we found about three times higher glycogen stores in the seal brain (∼4.1 ng per μg total protein in the seal cerebrum) than in the mouse brain. Notably, in aCSF containing no glucose, seal neurons can tolerate 20 mM lactate while in mouse neuronal activity vanished after few minutes even in normoxia. This can be considered as an adaptation to long dives, during which lactate accumulates in the blood.

AB  - Abstract
The heterozygous reeler mouse (HRM), haploinsufficient for reelin, shares several neurochemical and behavioral similarities with patients suffering from schizophrenia. It has been shown that defective reelin signaling influences the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways in a specific manner. However, there is only little information about the impact of reelin haploinsufficiency on the monoaminergic innervation of different brain areas, known to be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. In the present study using immunocytochemical procedures, we investigated HRM and wild-type mice (WT) for differences in the densities of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-immunoreactive (IR) and serotonin (5-HT)-IR fibers in prefrontal cortex, ventral and dorsal hippocampal formation, amygdala and ventral and dorsal striatum. We found that HRM, compared to WT, shows a significant increase in TH-IR fiber densities in dorsal hippocampal CA1, CA3 and ventral CA1. In contrast, HRM exhibits a significant decrease of TH-IR in the shell of the nucleus accumbens (AcbShell), but no differences in the other brain areas investigated. Overall, no genotype differences were found in the 5-HT-IR fiber densities. In conclusion, these results support the view that reelin haploinsufficiency differentially influences the catecholaminergic (esp. dopaminergic) systems in brain areas associated with schizophrenia. The reelin haploinsufficient mouse may provide a useful model for studying the role of reelin in hippocampal dysfunction and its effect on the dopaminergic system as related to schizophrenia.

AB  - Abstract
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive neurostimulation technique for the treatment of various neurological and psychiatric disorders. To investigate the working mechanism of this treatment approach, we designed a small-animal coil for dedicated use in rats and we combined this neurostimulation method with small-animal positron emission tomography (microPET or μPET) to quantify regional 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-d-glucose ([18F]-FDG) uptake in the rat brain, elicited by a low- (1 Hz) and a high- (50 Hz) frequency paradigm. Rats (n = 6) were injected with 1 mCi of [18F]-FDG 10 min after the start of 30 min of stimulation (1 Hz, 50 Hz or sham), followed by a 20-min μPET image acquisition. Voxel-based statistical parametric mapping (SPM) image analysis of 1-Hz and 50-Hz versus sham stimulation was performed. For both the 1-Hz and 50-Hz paradigms we found a large [18F]-FDG hypermetabolic cluster (2.208 mm3 and 2.616 mm3, resp.) (analysis of variance (ANOVA), p &lt; 0.05) located in the dentate gyrus complemented with an additional [18F]-FDG hypermetabolic cluster (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.05) located in the entorhinal cortex (2.216 mm3) for the 50-Hz stimulation. The effect on [18F]-FDG metabolism was 2.9 ± 0.8% at 1 Hz and 2.5 ± 0.8% at 50 Hz for the dentate gyrus clusters and 3.3 ± 0.5% for the additional cluster in the entorhinal cortex at 50 Hz. The maximal (4.19 vs. 2.58) and averaged (2.87 vs. 2.21) T-values are higher for 50 Hz versus 1 Hz.

This experimental study demonstrates the feasibility to combine μPET imaging in rats stimulated with rTMS using a custom-made small-animal magnetic stimulation setup to quantify changes in the cerebral [18F]-FDG uptake as a measure for neuronal activity.

AB  - Abstract
Stress, a common if unpredictable life event, can have pronounced effects on physiology and behavior. Individuals show wide variation in stress susceptibility and resilience, which are only partially explained by variations in coding genes. Developmental programing of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal stress axis provides part of the explanation for this variance. Epigenetic approaches have successfully helped fill the explanatory gaps between the influences of gene and environment on stress responsiveness, and differences in the sequelae of stress across individuals and generations. Stress and the stress axis interacts bi-directionally with epigenetic marks within the brain. It is now clear that exposure to stress, particularly in early life, has both acute and lasting effects on these marks. They in turn influence cognitive function and behavior, as well as the risk for suicide and psychiatric disorders across the lifespan and, in some cases, unto future generations.

AB  - Abstract
The latest advancements in neurobiological research provide increasing evidence that inflammatory and neurodegenerative pathways play an important role in depression. According to the cytokine hypothesis, depression could be due to the increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by microglia activation. Thus, using the BV-2 microglial cell line, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether fluoxetine (FLX) or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) could inhibit this microglia activation and could achieve better results in combination. Our results showed that FLX could attenuate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), the expression of the indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO) enzyme and the depletion of 5-HT. Moreover, FLX could inhibit phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and the combined use with ASA could enhance these effects. Notably, the adjunctive agent ASA could also inhibit phosphorylation of extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). Taken together, our results suggest that FLX may have some anti-inflammatory effects by modulating microglia activation and that ASA served as an effective adjunctive agent by enhancing these therapeutic effects.

This study aims to develop a transient ischemic attack (TIA) model in conscious animals and uses this model to investigate the effect of TIA on subsequent permanent ischemia. TIA was induced by injecting designed temperature-sensitive melted solid lipid microparticles with a melting point around body temperature into male Wistar rats via arterial cannulation. Neurologic deficit was monitored immediately after the injection without anesthesia. According to the clinical definition of TIA, rats were divided into neurologic symptom durations &lt;24-h, 24–48-h and ⩾48-h groups. The lipid microparticle-induced infarct volumes were small in the &lt;24-h and 24–48-h groups, while the volumes were five times larger in the ⩾48-h group. Permanent ischemic stroke was induced 3 d after the induction of TIA by injecting a different kind of embolic particle manufactured by blending chitin and PLGA. The &lt;24-h group had less severe neurologic deficits and smaller infarct volumes than that of 24–48-h and control (without prior lipid microparticle treatment) rats. Taken together, we successfully develop a TIA animal model which allows us to monitor the neurologic deficit in real-time. By adopting this model, we validate that TIA (&lt;24 h) preconditioning protects the brain from subsequent permanent ischemic stroke.

AB  - Abstract
The countermanding paradigm investigates the ability to withhold a response when a stop signal is presented occasionally. The race model (Logan and Cowan, 1984) was developed to account for performance in humans and to estimate the stop signal response time (SSRT). This model has yet to be fully validated for countermanding performance in rats. Furthermore, response adjustments observed in human performance of the task have not been examined in rodents. Male Wistar rats were trained to respond to a visual stimulus (go signal) by pressing a lever below that stimulus, but to countermand the lever press (25% of trials) subsequent to an auditory tone (stop signal) presented after a variable delay. We found decreased inhibitory success as stop signal delay (SSD) increased and estimated a SSRT of 157 ms. As expected by the race model, response time (RT) of movements that escaped inhibition: (1) were faster than responses made in the absence of a stop signal; (2) lengthened with increasing SSD; and (3) were predictable by the race model. In addition, responses were slower after stop trial errors, suggestive of error monitoring. Amphetamine (AMPH) (0.25, 0.5 mg/kg) resulted in faster go trial RTs, baseline-dependent changes in SSRT and attenuated response adjustments. These findings demonstrate that the race model of countermanding performance, applied successfully in human and nonhuman primate models, can be employed in the countermanding performance of rodents. This is the first study to reveal response adjustments and AMPH-induced alterations of response adjustments in rodent countermanding.

AB  - Abstract
We examined the difference in cerebral function alterations between drug-induced blepharospasm patients and essential blepharospasm (EB) patients by using positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose. Cerebral glucose metabolism was examined in 21 patients with drug-induced blepharospasm (5 men and 16 women; mean age, 53.1 [range, 29–78] years), 21 essential EB patients (5 men and 16 women; mean age, 53.0 [range, 33–72] years) and 24 healthy subjects (6 men and 18 women; mean age, 57.9 [range, 22–78] years) with long-term history of benzodiazepines use (drug healthy subjects). Drug-induced blepharospasm patients developed symptoms while taking benzodiazepines or thienodiazepines. Sixty-three normal volunteers (15 men and 48 women; mean age, 53.6 [range, 20–70] years) were examined as controls. Differences between the patient groups and control group were examined by statistical parametric mapping. Additionally, we defined regions of interests on both sides of the thalamus, caudate nucleus, anterior putamen, posterior putamen and primary somatosensory area. The differences between groups were tested using two-sample t-tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Cerebral glucose hypermetabolism on both side of the thalamus was detected in drug-induced blepharospasm, EB patients and drug healthy subjects by statistical parametric mapping. In the analysis of regions of interest, glucose metabolism in both sides of the thalamus in the drug-induced blepharospasm group was significantly lower than that in the EB group. Moreover, we observed glucose hypermetabolism in the anterior and posterior putamen bilaterally in EB group but not in drug-induced blepharospasm group and drug healthy subjects. Long-term regimens of benzodiazepines or thienodiazepines may cause down-regulation of benzodiazepine receptors in the brain. We suggest that the functional brain alteration in drug-induced blepharospasm patients is similar to that in EB patients, and that alteration of the GABAergic system might be related to the pathology of both blepharospasm types.

The ischemic stroke model of N2a/APP695 cells was made by 6 h oxygen–glucose deprivation/12 h reperfusion (OGDR). Drug administration of 3-methyladenine (3-MA), rapamycin or dl-3-n-butylphthalide (NBP) was started at the beginning of the OGDR and lasted until the end of reperfusion, in order to explore their effects on N2a/APP695 cells under OGDR conditions. Then the cells were incubated in the drug-free and full culture medium under normoxic conditions for 12 h. Cell viability and injury were investigated. The key proteins of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway and a key component of autophagy Beclin 1 were detected by Western blotting; immunofluorescence double-staining of amyloid-β (Aβ)1–42 with Beclin 1 was performed to investigate their cellular co-localization relationship; β-secretase and γ-secretase activity assay and Aβ1–42 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were performed to investigate the amyloidogenesis.
Results
The results showed that, OGDR enhanced cell injury, autophagy activity, neuroinflammation and Aβ generation in N2a/APP695 cells; down-regulating autophagy by 3-MA and NBP increased cell viability, decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) production, inhibited the activation of NF-κB pathway, suppressed β- and γ-secretase activities and Aβ generation; while up-regulating autophagy by rapamycin got the opposite results; immunofluorescence double-staining results showed elevated Aβ1–42+ signal was co-localized with Beclin 1+ signal.
Conclusion
Our data suggested that down-regulating autophagy may inhibit ischemia-induced neuroamyloidogenesis via suppressing the activation of NF-κB pathway. This study might help us to find a new therapeutic strategy to prevent brain ischemic damage and depress the risk of post-stroke dementia.

AB  - Abstract
Executive control of attention regulates our thoughts, emotion and behavior. Individual differences in executive control are associated with task-related differences in brain activity. But it is unknown whether attentional differences depend on endogenous (resting state) brain activity and to what extent regional fluctuations and functional connectivity contribute to individual variations in executive control processing. Here, we explored the potential contribution of intrinsic brain activity to executive control by using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) as an index of spontaneous brain activity, we found that ALFF in the right precuneus (PCUN) and the medial part of left superior frontal gyrus (msFC) was significantly correlated with the efficiency of executive control processing. Crucially, the strengths of functional connectivity between the right PCUN/left msFC and distributed brain regions, including the left fusiform gyrus, right inferior frontal gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus and right precentral gyrus, were correlated with individual differences in executive performance. Together, the ALFF and functional connectivity accounted for 67% of the variability in behavioral performance. Moreover, the strength of functional connectivity between specific regions could predict more individual variability in executive control performance than regionally specific fluctuations. In conclusion, our findings suggest that spontaneous brain activity may reflect or underpin executive control of attention. It will provide new insights into the origins of inter-individual variability in human executive control processing.

AB  - Abstract
Neonatal stroke occurs in approximately 1/4000 live births and results in life-long neurological impairments: e.g., cerebral palsy. Currently, there is no evidence-based specific treatment for neonates with stroke. Several studies have reported the benefits of umbilical cord blood (UCB) cell treatment in rodent models of neonatal brain injury. However, all of the studies examined the effects of administering either the UCB mononuclear cell fraction or UCB-derived mesenchymal stem cells in neonatal rat models. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of human UCB CD34+ cells (hematopoietic stem cell/endothelial progenitor cells) in a mouse model of neonatal stroke, which we recently developed. On postnatal day 12, immunocompromized (SCID) mice underwent permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCAO). Forty-eight hours after MCAO, human UCB CD34+ cells (1 × 105 cells) were injected intravenously into the mice. The area in which cerebral blood flow (CBF) was maintained was temporarily larger in the cell-treated group than in the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated group at 24 h after treatment. With cell treatment, the percent loss of ipsilateral hemispheric volume was significantly ameliorated (21.5 ± 1.9%) compared with the PBS group (25.6 ± 5.1%) when assessed at 7 weeks after MCAO. The cell-treated group did not exhibit significant differences from the PBS group in either rotarod (238 ± 46 s in the sham-surgery group, 175 ± 49 s in the PBS group, 203 ± 54 s in the cell-treated group) or open-field tests. The intravenous administration of human UCB CD34+ cells modestly reduced histological ischemic brain damage after neonatal stroke in mice, with a transient augmentation of CBF in the peri-infarct area.

AB  - Abstract
Primary auditory neurons (ANs) in the mammalian cochlea play a critical role in hearing as they transmit auditory information in the form of electrical signals from mechanosensory cochlear hair cells in the inner ear to the brainstem. Their progressive degeneration is associated with disease conditions, excessive noise exposure and aging. Replacement of ANs, which lack the ability to regenerate spontaneously, would have a significant impact on research and advancement in cochlear implants in addition to the amelioration of hearing impairment. The aim of this study was to induce a neuronal phenotype in endogenous non-neural cells in the cochlea, which is the essential organ of hearing. Overexpression of a neurogenic basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor, Ascl1, in the cochlear non-sensory epithelial cells induced neurons at high efficiency at embryonic, postnatal and juvenile stages. Moreover, induced neurons showed typical properties of neuron morphology, gene expression and electrophysiology. Our data indicate that Ascl1 alone or Ascl1 and NeuroD1 is sufficient to reprogram cochlear non-sensory epithelial cells into functional neurons. Generation of neurons from non-neural cells in the cochlea is an important step for the regeneration of ANs in the mature mammalian cochlea.

AB  - Abstract
Extracellular purines and pyrimidines are important signaling molecules that mediate diverse biological functions via cell surface purinergic receptors. Although purinergic modulation to olfactory activity has been reported, cell-specific expression and action of purinergic receptors deserve further exploration. We physiologically characterized expression of purinergic receptors in a set of olfactory sensory neurons that are responsive to both acetophenone and benzaldehyde (AB-OSNs). Sparsely distributed in the most ventral olfactory receptor zone, AB-OSNs were activated by P2 purinergic receptor agonists but not by P1 purinergic receptor agonist adenosine. Both P2X-selective agonist α,β-methylene ATP and P2Y-selective agonist uridine 5′-triphosphate (UTP) were stimulatory to AB-OSNs, indicating expression of both P2X and P2Y purinergic receptors in AB-OSNs. Pharmacological characterization of receptor specificity using various P2X and P2Y agonists and antagonists illustrated that P2X1 and P2Y2 receptors played major roles in purinergic signaling in AB-OSNs. Interestingly, the results of purinergic modulation to acetophenone-evoked responses were different from those to benzaldehyde-evoked responses within the same neurons. Activation of P2X1 receptors had more profound inhibitory effects on benzaldehyde-evoked intracellular calcium elevation than on acetophenone-evoked responses within the same neurons, and the reverse was true when P2Y2 receptors were activated. Cross-adaptation data showed that acetophenone and benzaldehyde bound to the same olfactory receptor. Thus, our study has demonstrated that purinergic signaling of P2X and P2Y receptors has different effects on olfactory transduction mediated by a defined olfactory receptor and the consequences of purinergic modulation of olfactory activity might depend on stereotypic structures of the odorant-receptor complex.

AB  - Abstract
Accumulating evidence supports that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase contributes to microglia-mediated neurotoxicity in the CNS neurodegenerative diseases. Several studies, including ours, suggest that microglial activation is involved in the retinal degeneration in the animal models of retinitis pigmentosa (RP). In the present study, we investigated the activation of NADPH oxidase in the rod degeneration in rd mice and further explored its role in the microglia-mediated photoreceptor apoptosis. Expression of gp91phox protein, a major subunit of NAPDH oxidase in the whole retina of rd mice at postnatal days (P) 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 was assessed by western blot analysis. Location of gp91phox in the rd retina at each age group and its cellular source were studied by immunohistochemical analysis and double labeling respectively. The generation of superoxide radicals in the rd retinas was demonstrated by intraperitoneal injection of hydroethidine. Apocynin was applied intraperitoneally in the rd mice from P8 to P14 to inhibit the activity of NAPDH oxidase and the outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness was measured before and after apocynin treatment. Our results demonstrated that during the rod degenerative process, the expression of gp91phox started to increase in the outer part of rd retina at P10 and reached a peak at P14. Double labeling of gp91phox with CD11b showed co-localization of gp91phox in the retinal microglial cells. Increasing generation of superoxide radicals visualized by hydroethidine was noted at P8 and reached a peak at P14. Apocynin markedly reduced the production of superoxide radicals and preserved the rod cells. The results suggested that NADPH oxidase might play an important role in the rod degeneration in the rd mice. Inhibition of NAPDH oxidase could be a possible approach to treat RP in the early degenerative stage.

AB  - Abstract
Prolonged activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) using the agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) produces long-lasting changes in the CA3 region of the hippocampal slice. Changes in CA3 pyramidal neuron excitability that follow DHPG exposure result in abnormal network activity manifest by epileptiform activity that consists of interictal and longer lasting ictal epileptiform discharges. In this study we evaluated changes in synaptic activity of CA3 neurons in rat hippocampal slices that occurred after exposure to DHPG. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were made from visually identified CA3 neurons in control artificial cerebrospinal fluid at times greater than 1 h after DHPG exposure. Compared to control slices, neurons from slices exposed to DHPG showed enhanced amplitude and frequency of spontaneously occurring excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) without a concurrent change in inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) amplitude or frequency. Miniature EPSCs were not affected by DHPG exposure but mIPSCs occurred less frequently and were of reduced amplitude. IPSCs recorded in the presence of ionotropic glutamate receptor blockade occurred less frequently in neurons that had been exposed to DHPG. Monosynaptic-evoked IPSPs were also reduced in amplitude in neurons that had been exposed to DHPG. Taken together, these findings demonstrated an enhanced network excitability of the CA3 region and failure of compensatory synaptic inhibition. We propose that prolonged activation of group I mGluR that may occur under conditions of pathological glutamate release results in long-lasting changes in CA3 synaptic network activity and epileptiform activity driven by excessive synaptic excitation.

AB  - Abstract
In the mammalian olfactory system, one olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) expresses a single olfactory receptor gene. By calcium imaging of individual OSNs in intact mouse olfactory turbinates, we observed that a subset of OSNs (Ho-OSNs) located in the most ventral olfactory receptor zone can mediate distinct signaling pathways when activated by structurally similar ligands. Calcium imaging showed that Ho-OSNs were highly sensitive to 2-heptanone, heptaldehyde and cis-4-heptenal. 2-heptanone-evoked intracellular calcium elevation was mediated by cAMP signaling while heptaldehyde triggered the diacylglycerol pathway. An increase of intracellular calcium evoked by cis-4-heptenal was due to a combination of activation mediated by the adenylate cyclase pathway and suppression generated by phospholipase C signaling. Pharmacological studies demonstrated that novel mechanisms were involved in the phospholipase C-mediated intracellular calcium changes. Binary-mixture studies and cross-adaptation data indicate that three odorants acted on the same olfactory receptor. The feature that an olfactory receptor mediates multiple signaling pathways was specific for Ho-OSNs and not established in another population of OSNs characterized. Our study suggests that distinct signaling pathways triggered by ligand-induced conformational changes of an olfactory receptor constitute a complex information process mechanism in olfactory transduction. This study has important implications beyond olfaction in that it provides insights of plasticity and complexity of G-protein-coupled receptor activation and signal transduction.

AB  - Abstract
State-dependent neuronal firing patterns reflect changes in ongoing information processing and cortical function. A disruption of neuronal coordination has been suggested as the neural correlate of anesthesia. Here, we studied the temporal correlation patterns of ongoing spike activity, during a stepwise reduction of the volatile anesthetic desflurane, in the cerebral cortex of freely moving rats. We hypothesized that the recovery of consciousness from general anesthesia is accompanied by specific changes in the spatiotemporal pattern and correlation of neuronal activity. Sixty-four contact microelectrode arrays were chronically implanted in the primary visual cortex (contacts spanning 1.4-mm depth and 1.4-mm width) for recording of extracellular unit activity at four steady-state levels of anesthesia (8–2% desflurane) and wakefulness. Recovery of consciousness was defined as the regaining of the righting reflex (near 4%). High-intensity firing (HI) periods were segmented using a threshold (200-ms) representing the minimum in the neurons’ bimodal interspike interval histogram under anesthesia. We found that the HI periods were highly fragmented in deep anesthesia and gradually transformed to a near-continuous firing pattern at wakefulness. As the anesthetic was withdrawn, HI periods became longer and increasingly correlated among the units both locally and across remote recording sites. Paradoxically, in 4 of 8 animals, HI correlation was also high at the deepest level of anesthesia (8%) when local field potentials (LFP) were burst-suppressed. We conclude that recovery from desflurane anesthesia is accompanied by a graded defragmentation of neuronal activity in the cerebral cortex. Hypersynchrony during deep anesthesia is an exception that occurs only with LFP burst suppression.

AB  - Abstract
The complement of mechanisms underlying tau pathology in neurodegenerative disorders has yet to be elucidated. Among these mechanisms, abnormal tau phosphorylation has received the most attention because neurofibrillary tangles present in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related disorders known as tauopathies are composed of hyperphosphorylated forms of this microtubule-associated protein. More recently, we showed that calpain-mediated cleavage leading to the generation of the 17 kDa tau45-230 fragment is a conserved mechanism in these diseases. To obtain insights into the role of this fragment in neurodegeneration, we generated transgenic mice that express tau45-230 and characterized their phenotype. Our results showed a significant increase in cell death in the hippocampal pyramidal cell layer of transgenic tau45-230 mice when compared to wild-type controls. In addition, significant synapse loss was detected as early as six months after birth in transgenic hippocampal neurons. These synaptic changes were accompanied by alterations in the expression of the N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate (NMDA) receptor subunits. Furthermore, functional abnormalities were detected in the transgenic mice using Morris Water Maze and fear conditioning tests. These results suggest that the accumulation of tau45-230 is responsible, at least in part, for neuronal degeneration and some behavioral changes in AD and other tauopathies. Collectively, these data provide the first direct evidence of the toxic effects of a tau fragment biologically produced in the context of these diseases in vertebrate neurons that develop in situ.

AB  - AbstractIntroduction
Angiogenin is a member of the ribonuclease superfamily and promotes degradation of the basement membrane and the extracellular matrix. After stroke in type one diabetes (T1DM) rats, Angiogenin is significantly increased and the Angiogenin is inversely correlated with functional outcome. Neamine, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, blocks nuclear translocation of Angiogenin, thereby abolishing the biological activity of Angiogenin. In this study, we therefore investigated the effect and underlying protective mechanisms of Neamine treatment of stroke in T1DM.
Methods
T1DM was induced in male Wistar rats by streptozotocin (60 mg/kg, ip), and T1DM rats were subjected to embolic middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Neamine (10 mg/kg ip) was administered at 2, 24 and 48 h after the induction of embolic MCAo. A battery of functional outcome tests was performed. Blood–brain barrier (BBB) leakage, and lesion volume were evaluated and immunostaining, and Western blot were performed.
Results
Neamine treatment of stroke in T1DM rats significantly decreased BBB leakage and lesion volume as well as improved functional outcome compared to T1DM-control. Neamine also significantly decreased apoptosis and cleaved caspase-3 in the ischemic brain. Using immunostaining, we found that Neamine treatment significantly decreased nuclear Angiogenin, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB) activity, advanced glycation endproducts receptor (RAGE) number, the positive area of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and increased Angeopoietin-1 expression compared to T1DM-MCAo control rats. Western blot results are consistent with the immunostaining.
Conclusion
Neamine treatment of stroke is neuroprotective in T1DM rats. Inhibition of neuroinflammatory factor expression and decrease of BBB leakage may contribute to Neamine-induced neuroprotective effects after stroke in T1DM rats.

AB  - Abstract
Persistent activation of GABAA receptors triggers compensatory changes in receptor function that are relevant to physiological, pathological and pharmacological conditions. Chronic treatment of cultured neurons with GABA for 48 h has been shown to produce a down-regulation of receptor number and an uncoupling of GABA/benzodiazepine site interactions with a half-time of 24–25 h. Down-regulation is the result of a transcriptional repression of GABAA receptor subunit genes and depends on activation of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. The mechanism of this uncoupling is currently unknown. We have previously demonstrated that a single brief exposure of rat primary neocortical cultures to GABA for 5–10 min (t½ = 3 min) initiates a process that results in uncoupling hours later (t½ = 12 h) without a change in receptor number. Uncoupling is contingent upon GABAA receptor activation and independent of voltage-gated calcium influx. This process is accompanied by a selective decrease in subunit mRNA levels. Here, we report that the brief GABA exposure induces a decrease in the percentage of α3-containing receptors, a receptor subtype that exhibits a high degree of coupling between GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites. Initiation of GABA-induced uncoupling is prevented by co-incubation of GABA with high concentrations of sucrose suggesting that it is dependent on a receptor internalization step. Moreover, results from immunocytochemical and biochemical experiments indicate that GABA exposure causes an increase in GABAA receptor endocytosis. Together, these data suggest that the uncoupling mechanism involves an initial increase in receptor internalization followed by activation of a signaling cascade that leads to selective changes in receptor subunit levels. These changes might result in the assembly of receptors with altered subunit compositions that display a lower degree of coupling between GABA and benzodiazepine sites. Uncoupling might represent a homeostatic mechanism that negatively regulates GABAergic transmission under physiological conditions in which synaptic GABAA receptors are transiently activated for several minutes.

AB  - Abstract
Ghrelin, an orexigenic brain-gut hormone promoting feeding and regulating energy metabolism in human and rodents, was reported to enhance both adult neurogenesis and hippocampus-dependent memory formation. However, it is still unclear whether ghrelin-induced hippocampus neurogenesis is responsible for its memory improvement. Using 5-bromo-2′ deoxyuridien (BrdU) to birth-date newborn neurons and c-Fos expression to identify dentate gyrus (DG) neurons involved in memory processes, we checked here the effect of ghrelin treatment on adult neurogenesis and cognitive behaviors in mice. We further examined the possible effect of ghrelin on the recruitment of new neurons into the spatial memory traces in intact mice. We found that systemic ghrelin treatment (80 μg/kg, ip injection once daily for 8 days) stimulated neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus, but had no effect on spatial memory formation. Consistently, it did not affect the incorporation of newborn neurons into the spatial memory circuits. On the contrary, local infusion of ghrelin (8 ng/0.5 μl into CA1 region of the hippocampus) impaired spatial memory formation, but did not affect adult neurogenesis. Our results thus suggested that ghrelin plays distinct roles in modulating adult neurogenesis and the memory acquisition in the hippocampus, the two processes may not be correlated and may be mediated by different mechanisms.

AB  - Abstract
Neonatal handling, an experimental model of early life experiences, is known to affect hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis function, thus increasing adaptability, coping with stress, cognitive abilities and in general brain plasticity-related processes. AMPA receptors (AMPARs) mediate fast synaptic transmission at excitatory glutamatergic synapses in the CNS and are crucial during neuronal development, synaptic plasticity and structural remodeling. AMPARs are composed of four types of subunits, designated as AMPA glutamate receptor subunits (GluA1, GluA2, GluA3 and GluA4), which combine to form tetramers. The present study addressed the question of whether neonatal handling (15 min daily maternal separation from postnatal day 1 (PND1) to PND21) might have an effect on GluA1–4 mRNA levels in adult rat male and female brain using in situ hybridization. We have identified selective sexually dimorphic effects of neonatal handling on the mRNA expression levels of AMPAR subunits in adult rat hippocampus and nuclei of the amygdaloid complex. In the dorsal hippocampus GluA1 mRNA levels were increased in handled males, while they were decreased in handled female animals. In the ventral hippocampus and the amygdaloid complex GluA2 mRNA was lower in handled females, while no effect was observed in handled males. Furthermore, we observed that neonatal handling induced in both sexes decreases of GluA2 mRNA in the dorsal hippocampus, as well as in the somatosensory and occipital cortex, of GluA3 mRNA in most hippocampal areas, amygdaloid complex and cortical regions studied, and of GluA4 mRNA in the ventral hippocampus. These results show that glutamatergic transmission is markedly affected by an early experience. The neonatal handling-induced alterations in AMPAR subunit composition are in line with the increased brain plasticity, the more effective HPA axis function, and in general the more adaptive behavioral phenotype known to characterize the handled animals.

AB  - Abstract
Loss-of-function in the Parkin protein is thought to play a part in causing neuronal cell death in patients with Parkinson’s disease. This study explores the effect of Parkin degradation, via the overexpression of nucleus accumbens 1 (NAC1), on cell viability. It was found that NAC1 and Parkin are co-localized within the cell and interact with one another, leading to a decrease in Parkin levels. Moreover, NAC1 down-regulates Parkin by presenting it for ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation, which causes a decrease in proteasomal activity in neuronal cells. Consequently, this decrease in proteasomal activity leads to an increase in the cells’ susceptibility to proteasome inhibition-induced toxicity. It was also found that Parkin and NAC1 are key proteins found to be present mainly in the cytoplasm and are co-localized in neurons of Parkinson’s disease patients. Interestingly, mutation in the POZ/BTB domain (Q23L) of NAC1 disrupts the co-localization and interaction of NAC1 with Parkin and it further abrogates the proteasome inhibition-induced toxicity. We further observed that co-transfection of the mutant form of NAC1 with Parkin reversed the proteasome activity and 20S proteasome protein levels. These results indicate a novel interaction between NAC1 and Parkin that leads to neuronal cell death, a main characteristic in Parkinson’s disease.

AB  - Abstract
The Roman Low- and High-Avoidance rat strains (RLA-I vs RHA-I) have been bidirectionally selected and bred according to their performance in the two-way active avoidance response in the shuttle-box test. Numerous studies have reported a pronounced divergence in emotionality between the two rat strains including differences in novelty seeking, anxiety, stress coping, and susceptibility to addictive substances. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms behind these divergent phenotypes are not known. Here, we determined impulsivity using the 5-choice serial reaction time task and levels of serotonin transporter (SERT), 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptor binding using highly specific radioligands (3H-escitalopram, 3H-MDL100907 and 3H-WAY100635) and mGlu2/3 receptor binding (3H-LY341495) using receptor autoradiography in fronto-cortical sections from RLA-I (n = 8) and RHA-I (n = 8) male rats. In the more impulsive RHA-I rats, 5-HT2A, 5-HT1A and SERT binding in the frontal cortex was significantly higher compared to RLA-I rats. In contrast, mGlu2/3 receptor binding was decreased by 40% in RHA-I rats compared to RLA-I rats. To differentiate between mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptor protein levels, these were further studied using western blotting, which showed non-detectable levels of mGlu2 receptor protein in RHA rats, while no differences were observed for mGlu3 receptor protein levels. Collectively, these data show general congenital differences in the serotonergic system and a pronounced difference in mGlu2 receptor protein levels. We suggest that the differences in the serotonergic system may mediate some of the phenotypic characteristics in this strain such as hyper-impulsivity and susceptibility to drug addiction.

AB  - Abstract
Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1)-dependent signaling in the brain is known to modulate food intake. Recent evidence has actually shown that CB1 can both inhibit and stimulate food intake in fasting/refeeding conditions, depending on the specific neuronal circuits involved. However, the exact brain sites where this bimodal control is exerted and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are not fully understood yet. Using pharmacological and electrophysiological approaches, we show that local CB1 blockade in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) increases fasting-induced hyperphagia in rats. Furthermore, local CB1 blockade in the PVN also increases the orexigenic effect of the gut hormone ghrelin in animals fed ad libitum. At the electrophysiological level, CB1 blockade in slices containing the PVN potentiates the decrease of the activity of PVN neurons induced by long-term application of ghrelin. Hence, the PVN is (one of) the site(s) where signals associated with the body’s energy status determine the direction of the effects of endocannabinoid signaling on food intake.

AB  - Abstract
Activation of the dopaminergic mesolimbic reward circuit that originates in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is postulated to preferentially suppress emotional responses to noxious stimuli, and presumably contributes to the addictive liability of strong analgesics. VTA dopamine neurons are activated via cholinergic afferents and microinjection of carbachol (cholinergic agonist) into VTA is rewarding. Here, we evaluated regional differences within VTA in the capacity of carbachol to suppress rats’ affective response to pain (vocalization afterdischarges, VADs) and to support conditioned place preference (CPP) learning. As carbachol is a non-specific agonist, muscarinic and nicotinic receptor involvement was assessed by administering atropine (muscarinic antagonist) and mecamylamine (nicotinic antagonist) into VTA prior to carbachol treatment. Unilateral injections of carbachol (4 μg) into anterior VTA (aVTA) and posterior VTA (pVTA) suppressed VADs and supported CPP; whereas, injections into midVTA failed to effect either VADs or CPP. These findings corroborate the hypothesis that the neural substrates underlying affective analgesia and reward overlap. However, the extent of the overlap was only partial. Whereas both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors contributed to carbachol-induced affective analgesia in aVTA, only muscarinic receptors mediated the analgesic action of carbachol in pVTA. The rewarding effects of carbachol are mediated by the activation of both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors in both aVTA and pVTA. The results indicate that analgesia and reward are mediated by separate cholinergic mechanisms within pVTA. Nicotinic receptor antagonism within pVTA failed to attenuate carbachol-induced analgesia, but prevented carbachol-induced reward. As addictive liability of analgesics stem from their rewarding properties, the present findings suggest that these processes can be neuropharmacologically separated within pVTA.

AB  - Abstract
Purkinje cell (PC) firing represents the sole output from the cerebellar cortex onto the deep cerebellar and vestibular nuclei. Here, we explored the different modes of PC firing in alert mice by extracellular recording. We confirm the existence of a tonic and/or bursting and quiescent modes corresponding to UP and DOWN state, respectively. We demonstrate the existence of a novel 600-Hz buzz UP state of firing characterized by simple spikes (SS) of very small amplitude. Climbing fiber (CF) input is able to switch the 600-Hz buzz to the DOWN state, as for the classical UP-to-DOWN state transition. Conversely, the CF input can initiate a typical SS pattern terminating into 600-Hz buzz. The 600-Hz buzz was transiently suppressed by whisker pad stimulation demonstrating that it remained responsive to peripheral input. It must not be mistaken for a DOWN state or the sign of PC inhibition. Complex spike (CS) frequency was increased during the 600-Hz buzz, indicating that this PC output actively contributes to the cerebello-olivary loop by triggering a disinhibition of the inferior olive. During the 600-Hz buzz, the first depolarizing component of the CS was reduced and the second depolarizing component was suppressed. Consistent with our experimental observations, using a 559-compartment single-PC model – in which PC UP state (of about −43 mV) was obtained by the combined action of large tonic AMPA conductances and counterbalancing GABAergic inhibition – removal of this inhibition produced the 600-Hz buzz; the simulated buzz frequency decreased following an artificial CS.

AB  - Abstract
A main component of St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum, HP) is hyperforin which has antioxidant properties in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, due to its ability to modulate NADPH oxidase and protein kinase C. Recent reports indicate that oxidative stress through NADPH oxidase activates TRPM2 channels. HP may be a useful treatment for Ca2+ entry and oxidative stress through modulation of TRPM2 channels in the DRG. We aimed to investigate the protective role of HP on Ca2+ entry and oxidative stress through TRPM2 channels in DRG neurons of rats.

The native rat DRG neurons were used in whole-cell patch-clamp, Fura-2 and antioxidant experiments. Appropriate, nontoxic concentrations and incubation times for HP were determined in the DRG neurons by assessing cell viability. The H2O2-induced TRPM2 currents were inhibited by 2-aminoethyl diphenylborinate (2-APB) and N-(p-amylcinnamoyl)anthranilic acid (ACA). TRPM2 current densities and cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration in the neurons were also reduced by HP (2 and 24 h). In Fura-2 experiments, cytosolic Ca2+ mobilization was reduced by voltage-gated calcium channel blockers (verapamil + diltiazem, V + D) and HP. Glutathione peroxidase activity and GSH values in the DRG were high in HP, 2-APB and V + D groups although lipid peroxidation level was low in the groups.

In conclusion, we observed a protective role for HP on Ca2+ entry through a TRPM2 channel in the DRG neurons. Since over-production of oxidative stress and Ca2+ entry are implicated in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain and neuronal inflammation, our findings may be relevant to the etiology and treatment of neuropathology in DRG neurons.

AB  - Abstract
Melatonin, a neurohormone secreted mainly by the pineal gland, has a variety of physiological functions and neuroprotective effects. Previous studies have shown that melatonin could stimulate the proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells (NS/PCs). Recent studies reported that the activities of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) of neural stem cells (NSCs) changed in response to the proliferative effect of melatonin. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to explore the proliferative mechanism mediated by melatonin on the adult rat hippocampal NS/PCs. Treatment with melatonin significantly increased the number of neurospheres in a concentration-dependent manner and up-regulated nestin protein. Pretreatment with luzindole, a melatonin receptor antagonist, and PD98059, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor, prevented the increase in the number of neurospheres formed by the activation of melatonin. The levels of phospho-c-Raf and phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) increased when treated with melatonin. Pretreatment with luzindole or PD98059 prevented the melatonin-induced increase in these signaling molecules. The present results showed that melatonin could induce NS/PCs to proliferate by increasing phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and c-Raf through melatonin receptor. These results provide further evidence for a role of melatonin in promoting neurogenesis, adding to the remarkably pleiotropic nature of this neurohormone. This intrinsic modulator deserves further investigation to better understand its physiological and therapeutic implication.

AB  - Abstract
During the early stages of development, the olfactory system plays a vital role in the survival of altricial mammals. One remarkable example is the Oryctolagus cuniculus, whose mother–young interaction greatly depends on the 2-methylbut-2-enal (2MB2) pheromone that triggers nipple search and grasping behaviors. Olfactory stimulation with 2MB2 regulates the expression of the core body temperature and locomotor activity rhythms in rabbit pups, indicating the modulation of the circadian system by this volatile cue. To address this issue, in the present study, we determined the effect of stimulation with pulses of 2MB2 on the molecular circadian clockwork in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and in the main olfactory bulb (MOB). For this purpose, 7-day-old rabbits were stimulated with distilled water (CON), with ethyl isobutyrate (ETHYL) or with the pheromone (2MB2) at different times of the cycle, and 1 h later, the expression of the activity marker C-FOS and of the clock proteins PER1, CRY1 and BMAL1 was evaluated in the SCN and in the three layers of the MOB.

The clock proteins were abundantly expressed in both structures; nevertheless these showed diurnal rhythmicity only in the MOB, confirming that central pacemakers exhibit a heterochronical development of the molecular clockwork. C-FOS expression in the SCN and in the MOB was modulated by exposure to ETHYL and to 2MB2 only when these stimulants were presented at ZT00 and at ZT18. In contrast, the clock proteins were essentially modulated by 2MB2 at ZT00 and at ZT06 in both structures. In addition, the PER1 and CRY1 proteins exhibited differential responses to stimulation in the three layers of the MOB. For the first time, we report a modulatory and time-dependent effect of the mammary pheromone 2MB2 on the expression of the core clock proteins in the SCN and in the MOB in rabbits during pre-visual stages of development.

AB  - Abstract
Motor learning results from practice but also between practice sessions. After skill acquisition early consolidation results in less interference with other motor tasks and even improved performance of the newly learned skill. A specific significance of the primary motor cortex (M1) for early consolidation has been suggested. Since synchronized oscillatory activity is assumed to facilitate neuronal plasticity, we here investigate alterations of motor-cortical oscillations by means of event-related desynchronization (ERD) at alpha (8–12 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) frequencies in healthy humans. Neuromagnetic activity was recorded using a 306-channel whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) system. ERD was investigated in 15 subjects during training on a serial reaction time task and 10 min after initial training. The data were compared with performance during a randomly varying sequence serving as control condition. The data reveal a stepwise decline of alpha-band ERD associated with faster reaction times replicating previous findings. The amount of beta-band suppression was significantly correlated with reduction of reaction times. While changes of alpha power have been related to lower cognitive control after initial skill acquisition, the present data suggest that the amount of beta suppression represents a neurophysiological marker of early cortical reorganization associated with motor learning.

AB  - Abstract
The murine genes encoding transthyretin (TTR) and retinol binding protein (RBP) were independently silenced by targeted disruption more than 10 years ago. Studies of both strains showed surprisingly little impact on either thyroid function or retinoid metabolism. Silencing TTR led to a relatively mild behavioral phenotype. In order to gain insight into the behavioral effect and determine if it was related to TTR’s function as the carrier of RBP we carried out simultaneous studies with homozygous Rbp4−/− and Ttr−/− animals 4–7 months of age. Both strains showed behavioral differences relative to Ttr and Rbp4 wild-type animals and each other. The patterns were discrete for each knockout although there was some overlap. Neuropathologic examination of the cortex and hippocampus revealed cortical and hippocampal (CA3) neuronal loss in both and some degree of gliosis, more pronounced in the Rbp4−/− mice. There also appeared to be a major reduction in proliferating neuroblasts in the subventricular zone in both strains, which was also more severe in the Rbp4−/− mice. This is the first description of behavioral abnormalities in Rbp4−/− mice. The data also indicate that it is unlikely that the behaviors seen in Ttr−/− mice are related to its function as an RBP carrier.

AB  - Abstract
Drug addiction behavior that is established and maintained by psychostimulants has been shown to be associated with the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system. Cocaine has been used for most prior studies testing this effect of psychostimulants and therefore relatively little is known about its counterpart amphetamine (AMP). To fill this gap, the present study was designed to test whether BDNF mRNA expression levels in the DA terminal regions were changed specifically by d-AMP-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) followed by drug-primed reinstatement. The dose of d-AMP, 1 mg/kg, was confirmed to significantly induce CPP. Using this dose, a group of rats was initially subjected to d-AMP CPP, which was followed by entry into an extinction protocol with an additional 3-day withdrawal before a drug-primed reinstatement test was carried out. Following extinction of d-AMP CPP, a lower dose of d-AMP, namely 0.75 mg/kg, was able to significantly reinstate CPP. The BDNF mRNA levels in the selected brain areas were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after the CPP and reinstatement. The BDNF mRNA level in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was significantly increased after the reinstatement, but not the CPP test. And, none of the other four assessed brain areas showed any change in BDNF mRNA level after d-AMP CPP or reinstatement. These findings support the notion that BDNF is involved in drug-seeking behavior and indicate that d-AMP reinstatement after extinction may be linked to an increase in BDNF mRNA expression in the mPFC.

AB  - Abstract
The mirror neuron system (MNS) is currently one of the most prominent areas of research in neuroscience. Some of the work has focused on the identification of factors that modulate its activity, but until now, no one has tried to identify the effect of motor ability on the MNS regions. The aim of the present work is to study a possible modulation of hand dexterity on the MNS activity.

A blocked fMRI experiment has been designed, consisting of an execution condition, where participants must repeatedly perform a precision grasping pantomime, and an observation condition, where the same motor action is passively observed. A conjunction analysis was performed in order to confirm the existence of mirror activity. Moreover, participants were classified depending on their hand dexterity (measured with the Purdue Pegboard Test) as “High dexterity” or “Low dexterity” and a regression analysis was performed to investigate a possible linear relationship between the degree of dexterity and brain activity in the MNS.

The conjunction analysis revealed, as expected, activity in the inferior parietal lobule, a region that constitutes one of the nuclei of the putative MNS and which is consistently activated by intransitive actions. The degree of dexterity only seems to modulate MNS regions during action execution. However, under the observation condition, no linear relationship of hand dexterity in MNS regions was registered in either the comparison between groups, or in the regression analysis.

Therefore, the MNS network does not seem to be linearly modulated by the degree of motor dexterity, as occurs with other action-related factors like familiarity.

AB  - Abstract
Decreased levels of soluble ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) have been reported in the brains of sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients, and the introduction of UCHL1 rescued the synaptic and cognitive function of AD model mice. Obviously, a reduction in the levels of UCHL1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of AD. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of UCHL1 levels in AD have not been fully elucidated. MicroRNAs (miRs) have been shown to participate in the process of AD. In our study, we discovered that microRNA-922 decreased the levels of UCHL1. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) mainly consisting of the hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau are the defining pathological features of AD. In the present study, we found the levels of UCHL1 affected the levels of phosphorylated tau: the phosphorylated tau levels increased after knockdown of UCHL1 expression, and the phosphorylated tau levels decreased when UCHL1 was overexpressed. Furthermore, overexpression of microRNA-922 increased the phosphorylated tau levels. In conclusion, miR-922 increasing the levels of phosphorylated tau by regulating UCHL1 levels contributed to the pathogenesis of AD. Our study partly explained one of the mechanisms underlying the downregulation of UCHL1 levels in AD patients and could enrich the content of tau pathology in the pathogenesis of AD.

AB  - Abstract
Double transgenic mice expressing mutant amyloid precursor protein (APPswe) and mutant presenilin 1 (PS1dE9) are a model of Alzheimer-type amyloidosis and are widely used in experimental studies. In the present work, the relationships between brain and plasma amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) levels and cognitive impairments were examined in male APPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic mice at different ages. When compared with non-transgenic littermates, APPswe/PS1dE9 mice exhibited significant learning deficits from the age of 6 months (M6), which were aggravated at later stages of life (M8 and M12). Sporadic brain amyloid plaques were observed in mice as early as M3 and progressively increased in number and size up to M12. A similar increase was observed in brain insoluble Aβ levels as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In particular, the levels of brain insoluble Aβ peptides rose steeply from M4 to M6. Interestingly, this pronounced amyloid deposition was accompanied by a temporary fall in the concentration of brain soluble and membrane-bound Aβ peptides at M6 that rose again at M8 and M12. The plasma levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 decreased with advancing age up to M8, when they stabilized at M12. This decrease in plasma Aβ levels coincided with the observed increase in insoluble brain Aβ levels. These results could be useful for developing plasma Aβ levels as possible biomarkers of the cerebral amyloidosis and provide advances in the knowledge of the Aβ peptide biochemical changes that occur in the brain of Alzheimer’s disease patients.

AB  - Abstract
Morphologically mixed chemical/electrical synapses at axon terminals, with the electrical component formed by gap junctions, is common in the CNS of lower vertebrates. In mammalian CNS, evidence for morphologically mixed synapses has been obtained in only a few locations. Here, we used immunofluorescence approaches to examine the localization of the neuronally expressed gap junction forming protein connexin36 (Cx36) in relation to the axon terminal marker vesicular glutamate transporter-1 (vglut1) in the spinal cord and the trigeminal motor nucleus (Mo5) of rat and mouse. In adult rodents, immunolabeling for Cx36 appeared exclusively as Cx36-puncta, and was widely distributed at all rostro-caudal levels in most spinal cord laminae and in the Mo5. A high proportion of Cx36-puncta was co-localized with vglut1, forming morphologically mixed synapses on motoneurons, in intermediate spinal cord lamina, and in regions of medial lamina VII, where vglut1-containing terminals associated with Cx36 converged on neurons adjacent to the central canal. Unilateral transection of lumbar dorsal roots reduced immunolabeling of both vglut1 and Cx36 in intermediate laminae and lamina IX. Further, vglut1-terminals displaying Cx36-puncta were contacted by terminals labeled for glutamic acid decarboxylase65, which is known to be contained in presynaptic terminals on large-diameter primary afferents. Developmentally, mixed synapses begin to emerge in the spinal cord only after the second to third postnatal week and thereafter increase to adult levels. Our findings demonstrate that axon terminals of primary afferent origin form morphologically mixed synapses containing Cx36 in broadly distributed areas of adult rodent spinal cord and Mo5.

AB  - Abstract
Early life stress can permanently alter functioning of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, which regulates the stress response and influences the perception of pain. Chronic pelvic pain patients commonly report having experienced childhood neglect or abuse, which increases the likelihood of presenting with comorbid chronic pain and/or mood disorders. Animal models of neonatal stress commonly display enhanced anxiety-like behaviors, colorectal hypersensitivity, and disruption of proper neuro-immune interactions in adulthood. Here, we tested the hypothesis that early life stress impacts vaginal sensitivity by exposing mice to neonatal maternal separation (NMS) for 3 h/day during the first two (NMS14) or three (NMS21) postnatal weeks. As adults, female mice underwent vaginal balloon distension (VBD), which was also considered an acute stress. Before or after VBD, mice were assessed for anxiety-like behavior, hindpaw sensitivity, and changes in gene and protein expression related to HPA axis function and regulation. NMS21 mice displayed significantly increased vaginal sensitivity compared to naïve mice, as well as significantly reduced anxiety-like behavior at baseline, which was heightened following VBD. NMS21 mice exhibited significant thermal and mechanical hindpaw hypersensitivity at baseline and following VBD. NMS14 mice displayed no change in anxiety-like behavior and only exhibited significantly increased hindpaw mechanical and thermal sensitivity following VBD. Centrally, a significant decrease in negative regulation of the HPA axis was observed in the hypothalamus and hippocampus of NMS21 mice. Peripherally, NMS and VBD affected the expression of inflammatory mediators in the vagina and bladder. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor and transient receptor potential (TRP) channel protein expression was also significantly, and differentially, affected in vagina, bladder, and colon by both NMS and VBD. Together these data indicate that NMS affects both central and peripheral aspects of the HPA axis, which may drive changes in vaginal sensitivity and the development of comorbid chronic pain and mood disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Increasing evidence has indicated that immune challenge by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces depressive-like behavior, neuroinflammatory response and upregulates phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4), an enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). However, whether the potential PDE4 inhibitor etazolate prevents the LPS-induced depressive-like behavior remains unclear. Here using a model of depression induced by the repeated administration of LPS during 16 days, and then investigated the influence of LPS on the expression of PDE4, interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and antidepressant action of etazolate in mice through forced swimming, novelty suppressed feeding, sucrose preference and open-field tests. Our results showed that etazolate pretreatment facilitated the recovery from weight loss and prevented the depressive-like behavior induced by repeated LPS administration. Moreover, the antidepressant action of etazolate was paralleled by significantly reducing the expression levels of PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4D and IL-1β and up-regulating the cAMP/phosphorylated cAMP response-element binding protein (pCREB)/brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of mice. These results indicate that the effects of etazolate on the depressive-like behavior induced by repeated LPS treatment may partially depend on the inhibition of PDE4 subtypes, the activation of the cAMP/pCREB/BDNF signaling and the anti-inflammatory responses in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.

AB  - Abstract
Encoding muscular force output during voluntary contractions is widely perceived to result, at least in part, from modulations in neuronal activity within the sensorimotor cortex. However the underlying electrophysiological phenomena associated with increased force output remains unclear. This study directly assessed sensorimotor cortex activity using electroencephalography (EEG) in humans performing isometric knee-extensions at a range of discrete torque levels. Fifteen healthy males (age 24 (s = 5) years) completed one familiarization and one experimental trial. Participants performed a cyclic series of 60 isometric knee-extension contractions with the right leg, including 15 contractions of a 5-s duration at each of four discrete torque levels: 15%, 30%, 45% and 60% of maximal voluntary torque (MVT). Isometric knee-extension torque, quadriceps electromyography and EEG were recorded at rest and throughout all the contractions. EEG (0.5–50 Hz) was collected using a 32-channel active-electrode cap. A voxel-based low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA) analysis calculated cortical activation within the sensorimotor cortex (one of 27 MNI coordinates) for the entire 0.5–50-Hz range (cortical current density (CCD)), as well as for each constituent frequency band in this range (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma). Gamma band (30–50 Hz) cortical activity increased with contraction torque (analysis of variance [ANOVA], P = 0.03). Conversely, activity within the other frequency bands was not modulated by torque (P ⩾ 0.09), nor was overall CCD (P = 0.11). Peripheral neuromuscular activation (quadriceps electromyography (EMG) amplitude) demonstrated distinct increases between each torque level (P &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, sensorimotor cortical activity within the gamma band demonstrated an overall increase with contraction torque, whereas both CCD and each of the other constituent frequency bands were not modulated by increments in torque magnitude during isometric knee-extension contractions up to 60%MVT.

AB  - Abstract
Balance control during upright standing is accompanied by an increased amplitude of motor-evoked potentials (MEP) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation and a decreased amplitude of the Hoffmann (H) reflex in the soleus muscle. Nonetheless, whether these observations reflect reciprocal adjustments between corticospinal and group I afferents pathways during upright standing remains unknown. To further investigate this question, cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (c-tDCS) applied over the motor cortex and vibration of Achilles tendons were used to modify the excitability of corticospinal and group I afferent pathways, respectively. MEPs and H reflexes were recorded in the soleus muscle during upright standing with or without bilateral Achilles tendon vibration, these recordings being performed before and after 20 min of c-tDCS (1.5 mA) or sham stimulation applied over the sensorimotor cortex. The results indicate that tendon vibration increased MEP amplitude (+28%) and decrease (−68%) the H-reflex amplitude (p &lt; 0.05). After c-tDCS, MEP amplitude was reduced by 13% and 26% without and with tendon vibration (p &lt; 0.05), respectively. In contrast, no significant change occurred in H-reflex amplitude after c-tDCS. Regardless of the conditions (c-tDCS and tendon vibration), no significant correlation was observed between changes in MEP and H-reflex amplitudes. The results failed to demonstrate close reciprocal changes in soleus MEP and H-reflex amplitudes during upright standing. These original findings suggest independent adjustments in corticospinal and group I afferents pathways during upright standing.

AB  - Abstract
In the present study, we addressed the question of whether the up-regulation of laminin expression represents the astroglio-vascular responses to status epilepticus (SE) in the rat brain to better understand the role of vasogenic edema in epileptogenic insult. In the hippocampus, vasogenic edema was observed in the hippocampus 12 h after SE when astroglial degeneration was undetected. Vasogenic edema in the hippocampus was more severe in the CA1 region where astroglial loss was absent than in the dentate gyrus showing astroglial degeneration. In the piriform cortex (PC), vasogenic edema was accompanied by appearance of astroglial degeneration 12 h after SE. Laminin expression in the hippocampus and the PC was increased 3 days and 4 days after SE, respectively. Laminin expression was up-regulated in the hippocampus and the PC with concomitant reduction of SMI-71 (the endothelial barrier antigen) expression. Four weeks after SE, laminin expression was reduced in vessels showing strong SMI-71 expression within vasogenic edema lesion. Inhibition of SE-induced vasogenic edema formation by BQ788 effectively prevented laminin over-expression. Therefore, our findings indicate that laminin over-expression may be one of consequences from vasogenic edema rather than astroglial loss, and that laminin over-expression may promote migration of astrocytes to damaged or newly generated vessels to repair brain–blood barrier (BBB) disruption accompanied by the reconstruction of endothelial barrier.

AB  - Abstract
Previous research has shown that Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients can increase the speed of their movement when catching a moving ball compared to when reaching for a static ball (Majsak et al., 1998). A recent model proposed by Redgrave et al. (2010) explains this phenomenon with regard to the dichotomic organization of motor loops in the basal ganglia circuitry and the role of sensory micro-circuitries in the control of goal-directed actions. According to this model, external visual information that is relevant to the required movement can induce a switch from a habitual control of movement toward an externally-paced, goal-directed form of guidance, resulting in augmented motor performance (Bieńkiewicz et al., 2013). In the current study, we investigated whether continuous acoustic information generated by an object in motion can enhance motor performance in an arm reaching task in a similar way to that observed in the studies of Majsak et al. (1998, 2008). In addition, we explored whether the kinematic aspects of the movement are regulated in accordance with time to arrival information generated by the ball’s motion as it reaches the catching zone. A group of 7 idiopathic PD (6 male, 1 female) patients performed a ball-catching task where the acceleration (and hence ball velocity) was manipulated by adjusting the angle of the ramp. The type of sensory information (visual and/or auditory) specifying the ball’s arrival at the catching zone was also manipulated. Our results showed that patients with PD demonstrate improved motor performance when reaching for a ball in motion, compared to when stationary. We observed how PD patients can adjust their movement kinematics in accordance with the speed of a moving target, even if vision of the target is occluded and patients have to rely solely on auditory information. We demonstrate that the availability of dynamic temporal information is crucial for eliciting motor improvements in PD. Furthermore, these effects appear independent from the sensory modality through-which the information is conveyed.

AB  - Abstract
Genipin, an important bioactive component from Gardenia jasminoides Eills, was demonstrated to possess antidepressant-like effects in a previous study. However, the molecular mechanism of antidepressant-like effects on genipin was not clear. The present study aimed to investigate the possible mechanism of antidepressant-like effects on genipin with a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression model in rats. In CUMS-induced depressive rats, bodyweight and 1% sucrose consumption decreased significantly compared with the normal control group. Furthermore, these changes could be significantly reversed by genipin application. The levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE) in the hippocampus decreased and the level of 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) increased in the CUMS-induced depressive rats. However, pre-treatments with genipin significantly increased the levels of 5-HT, NE and decreased the level of 5-HIAA in the hippocampus. The concentration of cAMP in the hippocampus was increased by genipin compared to the CUMS-exposed model group. The mRNA expressions of 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A receptor (5-HT1AR), cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in rats were decreased exposed to CUMS, which were reversed by genipin-treated rats exposed to CUMS. Compared to the CUMS-exposed model group, the mRNA expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) was decreased significantly by genipin-treated rats. The mRNA and protein expression of CREB, BDNF were increased in genipin-treated rats compared to the CUMS-exposed model group. Moreover, the levels of corticosterone in serum were decreased by genipin-treated compared to the CUMS-exposed model group. These results suggest that the possible mechanism of antidepressant-like effects on genipin, at least in one part, resulted from monoaminergic neurotransmitter system and the potential dysfunctional regulation of the post-receptor signaling pathway, which particularly affected the 5-HT1AR, 5-HT2AR and BDNF levels in the hippocampus.

AB  - AbstractBackground
ATP/ADP-evoked spinal astrocyte activation plays a vital role in the development of neuropathic pain. We aim to investigate the role of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway on the spinal astrocyte activation in the neuropathic pain development in rats.
Methods
Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were subjected to chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve (CCI). Rapamycin or ADP was intrathecally injected daily to explore their effects on spinal astrocyte activation and pain development. Expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and mTOR in the spinal dorsal horn was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Von Frey hairs and Hargreaves paw withdrawal test were conducted to evaluate mechanical allodynia and thermal sensitivity, respectively. Firefly luciferase ATP assay was used to assess the change of ATP level in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and medium of cultured astrocytes.
Results
GFAP expression was enhanced in the ipsilateral spinal dorsal horn from day 3 after surgery. GFAP and mTOR expression in the rat spinal dorsal horn on post-surgical day 14 was enhanced by daily intrathecal injection of ADP, which was inhibited by rapamycin. Rapamycin decreased lower mechanical pain threshold and the thermal withdrawal latency. Intrathecal injection of ADP enhanced the ATP release, which was partially inhibited by rapamycin. Study of cultured astrocytes indicated that ATP could be released from astrocytes.
Conclusion
Our data demonstrated that ADP enhanced neuropathic pain in CCI rats, which was inhibited by rapamycin. This study indicates that targeting mTOR pathway could serve as a novel therapeutic strategy in neuropathic pain management.

AB  - Abstract
Enteric viscerofugal neurons are mechanosensory interneurons that form the afferent limb of intestino-intestinal reflexes involving prevertebral sympathetic neurons. Fast synaptic inputs to viscerofugal neurons arise from other enteric neurons, but their sources are unknown. We aimed to describe the origins of synaptic inputs to viscerofugal neurons by mapping the locations of their cell bodies within the myenteric plexus. Viscerofugal neuron somata were retrogradely traced with 1,1′-didodecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethyl indocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) from colonic nerve trunks and impaled with microelectrodes, in longitudinal muscle/myenteric plexus preparations of the guinea-pig distal colon (39 impalements, n = 14). Thirty-eight viscerofugal neurons were uni-axonal and had the electrophysiological characteristics of myenteric S-neurons; one neuron was multipolar with AH-neuron electrophysiological characteristics. Depolarizing current pulses evoked either single- or multiple action potentials in viscerofugal neurons (range 1–25 spikes, 500 ms, 100–900 pA, 21 cells). Electrical stimulation of internodal strands circumferential to viscerofugal neurons evoked fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in 19/24 cells. Focal pressure-ejection of the nicotinic agonist 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide (DMPP, 10 μm) directly onto viscerofugal nerve cell bodies evoked large depolarizations and action potentials (23 ± 10 mV, latency 350 ± 230 ms, 21/22 cells). DMPP was then focally applied to multiple sites, up to 3 mm from the recorded viscerofugal neuron, to activate other myenteric S-neurons. In a few sites in myenteric ganglia, DMPP evoked repeatable fast EPSPs in viscerofugal neurons (latency 300 ± 316 ms, 38/394 sites, 10 cells). The cellular sources of synaptic inputs to viscerofugal neurons were located both orally and aborally (19 oral, 19 aboral), but the amplitude of oral inputs was consistently greater than aboral inputs (13.1 ± 4.3 mV vs. 10.1 ± 4.8 mV, respectively, p &lt; 0.05, paired t-test, n = 6). Most impaled viscerofugal neurons were nitric oxide synthase (NOS) immunoreactive (20/27 cells tested). Thus, the synaptic connections onto viscerofugal neurons within the myenteric plexus suggest that multiple enteric neural pathways feed into intestino-intestinal reflexes, involving sympathetic prevertebral ganglia.

AB  - Abstract
Human obesity is associated with increased leptin levels and pain, but the specific brain regions and neurochemical mechanisms underlying this association remain poorly understood. This study used adult male C57BL/6J (B6, n = 14) mice and leptin-deficient, obese B6.Cg-Lepob/J (obese, n = 10) mice to evaluate the hypothesis that nociception is altered by systemic leptin levels and by adenosine A1 receptors in the pontine reticular formation. Nociception was quantified as paw withdrawal latency (PWL) in s after onset of a thermal stimulus. PWL was converted to percent maximum possible effect (%MPE). After obtaining baseline PWL measures, the pontine reticular formation was microinjected with saline (control), three concentrations of the adenosine A1 receptor agonist N6-p-sulfophenyladenosine (SPA), or super-active mouse leptin receptor antagonist (SMLA) followed by SPA 15 min later, and PWL was again quantified. In obese, leptin-deficient mice, nociception was quantified before and during leptin replacement via subcutaneous osmotic pumps. SPA was administered into the pontine reticular formation of leptin-replaced mice and PWL testing was repeated. During baseline (before vehicle or SPA administration), PWL was significantly (p = 0.0013) lower in leptin-replaced obese mice than in B6 mice. Microinjecting SPA into the pontine reticular formation of B6 mice caused a significant (p = 0.0003) concentration-dependent increase in %MPE. SPA also significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased %MPE in B6 mice and in leptin-replaced obese mice, but not in leptin-deficient obese mice. Microinjection of SMLA into the pontine reticular formation before SPA did not alter PWL. The results show for the first time that pontine reticular formation administration of the adenosine A1 receptor agonist SPA produced antinociception only in the presence of systemic leptin. The concentration–response data support the interpretation that adenosine A1 receptors localized to the pontine reticular formation significantly alter nociception.

AB  - Abstract
Cell volume regulation (CVR) is essential for all types of cells in the central nervous system (CNS) to counteract cell volume changes that may be associated with neuronal activities or diseases and with osmosensing in the hypothalamus, to facilitate morphological changes during cell proliferation, differentiation and migration, and to execute apoptosis of cells. The regulation is attained by regulating the net influx or efflux of solutes and water across the plasma membrane. The volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying (VSOR) anion channel plays a major role in providing a pathway for anion flux during the regulation. The VSOR anion channel is permeable not only to Cl− ions but also to amino acids like glutamate and taurine. This property confers a means of intercellular communications through the opening of the channel in the CNS. Thus exploring the roles of VSOR anion channels is crucial to understand the basic principles of cellular functions in the CNS. Here we review biophysical and pharmacological characteristics of the VSOR anion channel in the CNS, discuss its activation mechanisms and roles in the CNS reported so far, and give some perspectives on the next issues to be examined in the near future.

AB  - Abstract
Sialic acid binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) are cell surface receptors of microglia and oligodendrocytes that recognize the sialic acid cap of healthy neurons and neighboring glial cells. Upon ligand binding, Siglecs typically signal through an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) to keep the cell in a homeostatic status and support healthy neighboring cells.

Siglecs can be divided into two groups; the first, being conserved among different species. The conserved Siglec-4/myelin-associated glycoprotein is expressed on oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. Siglec-4 protects neurons from acute toxicity via interaction with sialic acids bound to neuronal gangliosides. The second group of Siglecs, named CD33-related Siglecs, is almost exclusively expressed on immune cells and is highly variable among different species. Microglial expression of Siglec-11 is human lineage-specific and prevents neurotoxicity via interaction with α2.8-linked sialic acid oligomers exposed on the neuronal glycocalyx. Microglial Siglec-E is a mouse CD33-related Siglec member that prevents microglial phagocytosis and the associated oxidative burst. Mouse Siglec-E of microglia binds to α2.8- and α2.3-linked sialic acid residues of the healthy glycocalyx of neuronal and glial cells. Recently, polymorphisms of the human Siglec-3/CD33 were linked to late onset Alzheimer’s disease by genome-wide association studies. Human Siglec-3 is expressed on microglia and produces inhibitory signaling that decreases uptake of particular molecules such as amyloid-β aggregates. Thus, glial ITIM-signaling Siglecs recognize the intact glycocalyx of neurons and are involved in the modulation of neuron–glia interaction in healthy and diseased brain.

AB  - Abstract
The laggard (lag) mutant mouse, characterized by hypomyelination and cerebellar ataxia, is a spontaneously occurring mutant mouse caused by mutation in the Kif14 gene. In this mutant mouse, the laminated structures such as the cerebral and cerebellar cortices and the dentate gyrus are cytoarchitecturally abnormal. Macroscopically, the olfactory bulb of the lag mutant mouse is smaller in size and more transparent than the normal counterpart. Hematoxylin–eosin staining reveals that the mutant olfactory bulb has normal lamination in general, but detailed analysis has demonstrated that olfactory periglomerular cells and granule cells are reduced in number. In the mutant, olfactory glomeruli are cytoarchitecturally disorganized and mitral cells are arranged in multiple cell layers instead of being arranged in a single layer. The rostral migratory stream in the mutant becomes gradually thinner or obliterated during early postnatal days. Some of mitral cells and periglomerular cells are multinucleated, suggesting that Kif14 mutation leads to an abnormal cell division. In the mutant, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle are increased in number, especially at perinatal age, suggesting that the decreased population of granule cells in the lag mutant mouse is caused by the increased apoptotic cell death. The olfactory input appears to be intact, as indicated by anterograde labeling of olfactory nerves with an injection of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) into the olfactory mucosa. In conclusion, the olfactory bulb of the lag mutant mouse is cytoarchitecturally affected, suggesting that the causal gene for lag mutation, i.e., Kif14, has multiple effects on the development of laminated structures in the central nervous system in addition to the myelin formation.

AB  - Abstract
Gap junctions facilitate intercellular communication and are important in brain development. Connexins (Cx) comprise a transmembrane protein family that forms gap junctions. Cx-32 is expressed in oligodendrocytes and neurons, Cx-36 in neurons, and Cx-43 in astrocytes. Although single antenatal steroid courses are recommended for fetal lung maturation, multiple courses can be given to women at recurrent risk for premature delivery. We examined the effects of single and multiple glucocorticoid courses on Cx-32, Cx-36, and Cx-43 protein expressions in the fetal cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord, and differences in Cx expression among brain regions under basal conditions. In the single-course groups, the ewes received dexamethasone (6 mg) or placebo as four intramuscular injections every 12 h over 48 h. In the multiple-course groups, the ewes received the same treatment, once a week for 5 weeks starting at 76–78 days of gestation. Cx were measured by Western immunoblot on brain samples from 105 to 108-day gestation fetuses. A single dexamethasone course was associated with increases (P &lt; 0.05) in cerebral cortical and spinal cord Cx-36 and Cx-43 and multiple courses with increases in cerebellar and spinal cord Cx-36, and cerebral cortical and cerebellar Cx-43. Cx-32 did not change. Cx-32 was higher in the cerebellum than cerebral cortex and spinal cord, Cx-36 higher in the spinal cord than cerebellum, and Cx-43 higher in the cerebellum and spinal cord than cerebral cortex during basal conditions. In conclusion, maternal glucocorticoid therapy increases specific Cx, responses to different maternal courses vary among Cx and brain regions, and Cx expression differs among brain regions under basal conditions. Maternal treatment with glucocorticoids differentially modulates Cx in the fetal brain.

GABA is the neurotransmitter of striatal projection neurons, however the contribution of the striatal GABAergic output to behavior is not well understood. We assessed motor function, spatial learning, social behavior, olfactory and object recognition preferences in mice lacking the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase, Gad67, in neurons expressing the protein Gpr88, an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor primarily expressed in the striatum. Gad67-deficient mice show no impairments in motor coordination and balance, but exhibit enhanced locomotor activity and stereotypic grooming behavior. Furthermore, Gad67-deficient mice show impairments in spatial learning, social behavior, olfactory preferences, and they prefer a familiar compared to a novel object in the object recognition test. These findings provide original evidence that striatal Gad67 expression is involved in the modulation of learning and social behavior. Some of the behavioral abnormalities observed in Gad67-deficient mice are reminiscent of Autism-spectrum-disorder (ASD) deficits, suggesting that abnormal striatal GABAergic output may contribute to behavioral deficits in ASD.

AB  - Abstract
Mutation in presenilin 1 (PS1) is one of the leading causes of familial Alzheimer’s disease (fAD). PS1 mutation exacerbates the autophagic and lysosomal pathology in AD patients, leading to accumulation of partially degraded material in bloated lysosomes and autophagosomes – a pathology that bears some resemblance to other diseases characterized by elevated lysosomal pH, like age-related macular degeneration. In this study, we examined the effect of the PS1-fAD mutation A246E on lysosomal pH and lysosomal function, and asked whether restoration of lysosomal pH could reverse some of these changes. Lysosomal pH was elevated by 0.2–0.3 pH units in human fibroblasts with the PS1-fAD mutation. The lysosomal alkalization in PS1-fAD fibroblasts was supported by a reduction in the pH-dependent cleavage of cathepsin D and by a reduction in binding of boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) FL-pepstatin A to the cathepsin D active site. PS1-fAD cells had increased LC3B-II/-I ratios and p62 levels, consistent with impaired lysosomal degradation and analogous to changes induced by lysosomal alkalinization with chloroquine. PS1-fAD fibroblasts had increased expression of ATP6V1B2, ATG5, BECN1 TFEB mRNA, and of ATP6V1B2, ATG5 and beclin at the protein level, consistent with chronic impairment of autophagic and lysosomal functions in the mutant cells. Critically, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) treatment reacidified lysosomal pH in mutant PS1-fAD; cAMP also increased the availability of active cathepsin D and lowered the LC3B-II/-I ratio. These results confirm a small elevation in the lysosomal pH of human PS1-fAD fibroblasts, demonstrate that this lysosomal alkalization is associated with chronic changes in autophagy and degradation, and suggest that treatment to reacidify the lysosomes with cAMP can reverse these changes.

Cajal–Retzius cells (CRc) represent a mostly transient neuronal cell type localized in the uppermost layer of the developing neocortex. The observation that CRc are a major source of the extracellular matrix protein reelin, which is essential for the laminar development of the cerebral cortex, attracted the interest in this unique cell type. In this review we will (i) describe the morphological and molecular properties of neocortical CRc, with a special emphasize on the question which markers can be used to identify CRc, (ii) summarize reports that identified the different developmental origins of CRc, (iii) discuss the fate of CRc, including recent evidence for apoptotic cell death and a possible persistence of some CRc, (iv) provide a detailed description of the electrical membrane properties and transmitter receptors of CRc, and (v) address the role of CRc in early neuronal circuits and cortical development. Finally, we speculate whether CRc may provide a link between early network activity and the structural maturation of neocortical circuits.

AB  - Abstract
Intrauterine infection or inflammation in preterm neonates is a known risk for adverse neurological outcomes, including cognitive, motor and behavioral disabilities. Our previous data suggest that there is acute fetal brain inflammation in a mouse model of intrauterine exposure to lipopolysaccharides (LPS). We hypothesized that the in utero inflammation induced by LPS produces long-term electroencephalogram (EEG) biomarkers of neurodegeneration in the exposed mice that could be determined by using continuous quantitative video/EEG/electromyogram (EMG) analyses. A single LPS injection at E17 was performed in pregnant CD1 dams. Control dams were injected with same volumes of saline (LPS n = 10, Control n = 8). At postnatal age of P90–100, 24-h synchronous video/EEG/EMG recordings were done using a tethered recording system and implanted subdural electrodes. Behavioral state scoring was performed blind to treatment group, on each 10 s EEG epoch using synchronous video, EMG and EEG trace signatures to generate individual hypnograms. Automated EEG power spectrums were analyzed for delta and theta-beta power ratios during wake vs. sleep cycles. Both control and LPS hypnograms showed an ultradian wake/sleep cycling. Since rodents are nocturnal animals, control mice showed the expected diurnal variation with significantly longer time spent in wake states during the dark cycle phase. In contrast, the LPS-treated mice lost this circadian rhythm. Sleep microstructure also showed significant alteration in the LPS mice specifically during the dark cycle, caused by significantly longer average non-rapid eye movement (NREM) cycle durations. No significance was found between treatment groups for the delta power data; however, significant activity-dependent changes in theta-beta power ratios seen in controls were absent in the LPS-exposed mice. In conclusion, exposure to in utero inflammation in CD1 mice resulted in significantly altered sleep architecture as adults that were circadian cycle and activity state dependent.

AB  - Abstract
The vascular disruption, blood vessel loss and cavitation that occur at spinal cord injury (SCI) epicenters in mice and rats are different, but few studies have compared the acute SCI response in the two species. This is of interest since key elements of the rat SCI response are shared with humans. In this study, we investigated acute SCI responses and characterized changes in pro- and anti-angiogenic factors and matrix deposition in both species. Cavitation was absent in mouse but the area of the lesion site was 21- and 27-fold larger at 8 and 15 days post-lesion (dpl), respectively, in the rat compared to intact control. The absence of wound cavitation in the mouse was correlated with increased levels of immunoreactive pro-angiogenic, pro-matrix and pro-wound-healing factors, e.g. laminin, matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) within the wound, which were 6.0-, 2.9-, and 2.8-fold, respectively, higher in the mouse compared to rats at 8 dpl. Increased axonal sparing was observed after dorsal column (DC) injury, detected by higher levels of neurofilament 200 (NF200) immunoreactivity in the dorsal column of mice compared to rats at both T7 and T9 spinal segments. Despite similar post SCI deficits in plantar heat tests at 2 h after injury (1.4- and 1.6-fold lower than control mice and rats, respectively), by 7 days the magnitude of these responses were comparable to sham-treated controls in both species, while no post-SCI changes in Von Frey hair filament test response were observed in either species. We conclude that the more robust angiogenesis/wound-healing response in the mouse attenuates post-injury wound cavitation. Although the spinal cord functions that were monitored post-injury were similarly affected in both species, we suggest that the quality of the angiogenesis/wound-healing response together with the diminished lesion size seen after mouse SCI may protect against secondary axon damage and create an environment more conducive to axon sprouting/regeneration. These results suggest the potential therapeutic utility of manipulating the angiogenic response after human SCI.

AB  - Abstract
Vision is important for locomotion in complex environments. How it is used to guide stepping is not well understood. We used an eye search coil technique combined with an active marker-based head recording system to characterize the gaze patterns of cats walking over terrains of different complexity: (1) on a flat surface in the dark when no visual information was available, (2) on the flat surface in light when visual information was available but not required for successful walking, (3) along the highly structured but regular and familiar surface of a horizontal ladder, a task for which visual guidance of stepping was required, and (4) along a pathway cluttered with many small stones, an irregularly structured surface that was new each day. Three cats walked in a 2.5-m corridor, and 958 passages were analyzed. Gaze activity during the time when the gaze was directed at the walking surface was subdivided into four behaviors based on speed of gaze movement along the surface: gaze shift (fast movement), gaze fixation (no movement), constant gaze (movement at the body’s speed), and slow gaze (the remainder). We found that gaze shifts and fixations dominated the cats’ gaze behavior during all locomotor tasks, jointly occupying 62–84% of the time when the gaze was directed at the surface. As visual complexity of the surface and demand on visual guidance of stepping increased, cats spent more time looking at the surface, looked closer to them, and switched between gaze behaviors more often. During both visually guided locomotor tasks, gaze behaviors predominantly followed a repeated cycle of forward gaze shift followed by fixation. We call this behavior “gaze stepping”. Each gaze shift took gaze to a site approximately 75–80 cm in front of the cat, which the cat reached in 0.7–1.2 s and 1.1–1.6 strides. Constant gaze occupied only 5–21% of the time cats spent looking at the walking surface.

AB  - Abstract
Increased low-grade inflammation is thought to be associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by decreased neuronal plasticity. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between structural changes in the human brain during cognitive training and the intensity of low-grade peripheral inflammation in healthy individuals (n = 56). A two-month training (30 min/day) with a platformer video game resulted in a significantly increased volume of the right hippocampal formation. The number of stressful life events experienced during the past year was associated with less pronounced enlargement of the hippocampus. However, the main predictor of hippocampal volume expansion was the relative peripheral expression of Nuclear Factor-κB (NF-κB), a transcription factor playing a central role in the effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein levels were not related to hippocampal plasticity when NF-κB was taken into consideration. These results suggest that more intensive peripheral inflammation is associated with weaker neuronal plasticity during cognitive training.

AB  - Abstract
Cocaine abuse disrupts reward and homeostatic processes through diverse processes, including those involved in circadian clock regulation. Recently we showed that cocaine administration to mice disrupts nocturnal photic phase resetting of the suprachiasmatic (SCN) circadian clock, whereas administration during the day induces non-photic phase shifts. Importantly, the same effects are seen when cocaine is applied to the SCN in vitro, where it blocks photic-like (glutamate-induced) phase shifts at night and induces phase advances during the day. Furthermore, our previous data suggest that cocaine acts in the SCN by enhancing 5-HT signaling. For example, the in vitro actions of cocaine mimic those of 5-HT and are blocked by the 5-HT antagonist, metergoline, but not the dopamine receptor antagonist, fluphenazine. Although our data are consistent with cocaine acting through enhanced 5-HT signaling, the nonselective actions of cocaine as an antagonist of monoamine transporters raises the question of whether inhibition of the 5-HT transporter (SERT) is key to its circadian effects. Here we investigate this issue using transgenic mice expressing a SERT that exhibits normal 5-HT recognition and transport but significantly reduced cocaine potency (SERT Met172). Circadian patterns of SCN behavioral and neuronal activity did not differ between wild-type (WT) and SERT Met172 mice, nor did they differ in the ability of the 5-HT1A,2,7 receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT to reset SCN clock phase, consistent with the normal SERT expression and activity in the transgenic mice. However, (1) cocaine administration does not induce phase advances when administered in vivo or in vitro in SERT Met172 mice; (2) cocaine does not block photic or glutamate-induced phase shifts in SERT Met172 mice; and (3) cocaine does not induce long-term changes in free-running period in SERT Met172 mice. We conclude that SERT antagonism is required for the phase shifting of the SCN circadian clock induced by cocaine.

Placebo treatment can alter brain activation in regions implicated in affective processing and cognitive control of emotions. This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigated whether a placebo can additionally modulate visual cortex activity and connectivity during affective picture perception. The participants underwent a retest design where they were presented with disgusting, fear-eliciting and neutral pictures both with, and without a placebo (inert pill presented with the suggestion that it can reduce disgust symptoms). The placebo provoked a strong decrease in experienced disgust. This was accompanied by a reduced activation of the primary visual cortex, which showed reduced interaction with the amygdala and the insula. Accordingly, placebos are able to affect basic perceptive processes.

AB  - Abstract
Our human visual system exploits spatiotemporal regularity to interpret incoming visual signals. With a dynamic stimulus sequence of four collinear bars (predictors) appearing consecutively toward the fovea, followed by a target bar with varying contrasts, we have previously found that this predictable spatiotemporal stimulus structure enhances target detection performance and its underlying neural process starts in the primary visual cortex (area V1). However, the relative contribution of V1 lateral and feedback connections in the processing of spatiotemporal regularity remains unclear. In this study we measured human contrast detection of a briefly presented foveal target that was embedded in a dynamic collinear predictor-target sequence. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to selectively disrupt V1 horizontal and feedback connections in the processing of predictors. The coil was positioned over a cortical location corresponding to the location of the last predictor prior to target onset. Single-pulse TMS at an intensity of 10% below phosphene threshold was delivered at 20 or 90 ms after the predictor onset. Our analysis revealed that the delivery of TMS at both time windows equally reduced, but did not abolish, the facilitation effect of the predictors on target detection. Furthermore, if the predictors’ ordination was randomized to suppress V1 lateral connections, the TMS disruption was significantly more evident at 20 ms than at 90-ms time window. We suggest that both lateral and feedback connections contribute to the encoding of spatiotemporal regularity in V1. These findings develop understanding of how our visual system exploits spatiotemporal regularity to facilitate the efficiency of visual perception.

AB  - Abstract
Mastication is one of the most important oral functions, and the period during which mastication is acquired overlaps with the term of rapid development and maturation of the neural systems. In particular, the acquisition period after weaning is related to the potential onset of mental disorders. However, the roles of mastication during this period for brain development remain largely unknown. Therefore, we used a series of standard behavioral analyses, assessment of hippocampal cell proliferation, and the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), TrkB, and Akt1 in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of mice to investigate the effects of post-weaning mastication on brain function.

We fed 21-day-old C57BL6/J male mice either a hard or a soft diet for 4 weeks and conducted a series of standard behavioral tests from 7 weeks of age. Further, histological analysis with bromodeoxyuridine was performed to compare hippocampal cell proliferation at 7 and 14 weeks of age. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to compare BDNF, TrkB, and Akt1 expression in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of 14-week-old mice.

Compared to mice fed a hard diet (HDM), soft-diet mice (SDM) showed behavioral impairments, including decreased home cage activity, increased open field test activity, and deficits in prepulse inhibition. These results were similar to those observed in mouse models of schizophrenia. However, no effects were observed on anxiety-like behaviors or memory/learning tests. Compared to HDM, SDM showed significantly decreased hippocampal cell proliferation and hippocampal BDNF and Akt1 gene expression at 14 weeks of age. A soft diet after weaning may have resulted in histological and molecular changes in the hippocampus and influenced outcomes of behavioral tests related to mental disorders.

Our findings suggest that soft-diet feeding after weaning may affect both physical and mental development of mice, and may increase vulnerability to mental disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by inflammation and iron accumulation in the substantia nigra (SN) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). In the present study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between inflammation and iron accumulation in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced Parkinsonian rat model. The activation of glial cells and elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were observed in the SN of LPS models, accompanied by iron deposits in the same region. Moreover, ferroportin (Fpn), the only channel for iron export, was down-regulated. SH-SY5Y dopaminergic cells were pre-incubated with conditioned media enriched in pro-inflammatory cytokines, and abnormal iron deposits and a drop of Fpn were observed. The expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was also upregulated in vivo and in vitro. These results suggested that pro-inflammatory cytokines might induce Fpn downregulation, which leads to iron accumulation and dopaminergic neurons’ degeneration in PD. HO-1 may also contribute to the iron accumulation in neurons, but its mechanism needs to be further investigated.

It is well known that the H-reflex amplitude decreases during passive muscle lengthening in comparison with passive shortening. However, this decrease in spinal synaptic efficacy observed during passive lengthening seems to be lesser during eccentric voluntary contraction. The aim of the present study was to examine whether spinal excitability during lengthening condition could be modulated by magnetic brain stimulation. H reflexes of the triceps surae muscles were elicited on 10 young healthy subjects, and conditioned by a sub-threshold transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The conditioning stimulation was applied over the M1 area of triceps surae muscles at an intensity below motor threshold with a conditioning-test interval of 5 ms. Conditioned and non-conditioned H-reflexes were elicited at rest, during passive lengthening and shortening, and during submaximal contractions (concentric, eccentric and isometric). During passive and active lengthening, H reflexes conditioned by a sub-threshold TMS pulse increased on average by 50% compared with non-conditioned responses. No significant effect was found during isometric and concentric conditions. Activation of the corticospinal pathway would partially cancel inhibitions caused by muscle stretch, and according to the time-delayed effect, this result suggested the existence of a specific polysynaptic pathway. In additional experiments, H responses were conditioned by cervico-medullary stimulations, showing that the modulation described by the previous results involves subcortical mechanisms. This study provides further evidences that the modulation of the final cortico-spinal command reaching the muscle depends on a central mechanism that controls peripheral input, such as Ia afference discharge during lengthening.

AB  - Abstract
Previous studies have shown that patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) experience extensive problems during dual tasking. Up to now, dual-task interference in PD has mainly been investigated in the context of gait research. However, the simultaneous performance of two different tasks is also a prerequisite to efficiently perform many other tasks in daily life, including upper limb tasks. To address this issue, this study investigated the effect of a secondary cognitive task on the performance of handwriting in patients with PD. Eighteen PD patients and 11 age-matched controls performed a writing task involving the production of repetitive loops under single- and dual-task conditions. The secondary task consisted of counting high and low tones during writing. The writing tests were performed with two amplitudes (0.6 and 1.0 cm) using a writing tablet. Results showed that dual-task performance was affected in PD patients versus controls. Dual tasking reduced writing amplitude in PD patients, but not in healthy controls (p = 0.046). Patients’ writing size was mainly reduced during the small-amplitude condition (small amplitude p = 0.017; large amplitude p = 0.310). This suggests that the control of writing at small amplitudes requires more compensational brain-processing recourses in PD and is as such less automatic than writing at large amplitudes. In addition, there was a larger dual-task effect on the secondary task in PD patients than controls (p = 0.025). The writing tests on the writing tablet proved highly correlated to daily life writing as measured by the ‘Systematic Screening of Handwriting Difficulties’ test (SOS-test) and other manual dexterity tasks, particularly during dual-task conditions. Taken together, these results provide additional insights into the motor control of handwriting and the effects of dual tasking during upper limb movements in patients with PD.

AB  - Abstract
Under normal and dietary iron deficiency conditions, the BXD recombinant inbred (RI) strains of mice show large variations in regional brain iron concentration, particularly in the ventral midbrain (VMB). In a study utilizing just one of the BXD strains, diurnal changes in subregional brain iron concentration were found, which were dependent on the brain region and sex of the mice. The focus of this study was to determine if diurnal changes in VMB can be found across other BXD RI strains and whether a diurnal effect would be common to all strains or variable across strains similar to the large strain variability in iron concentrations determined during the first part of the light phase. Eight RI (BXD type) strains of mice of both sexes were selected for this study. Mice were sacrificed at postnatal day 120: half in the light phase (LP) and half in the dark phase (DP) of the light–dark cycle. Iron concentrations were determined in VMB, which was the primary region of interest, and five other brain regions. Exploratory analysis was also done on liver and spleen iron concentrations to assess for diurnal changes. Three strains showed clear diurnal variation in iron in the VMB and the others strains showed diurnal variations in other regions. These changes were not equally apparent in both sexes. Exploratory analysis also found strain × sex-dependent diurnal differences in spleen and liver iron. In conclusion, significant brain-regional-specific diurnal changes in total iron concentrations were found in a selection of BXD RI mice. Sex and strain are functional determinates of which regions will be affected and in what direction the affect will be. The study provides an animal model for future work into determining the biological and genetic basis of circadian influences on VMB iron homeostasis.

AB  - Abstract
Clinical observations suggested that gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) protects nerve cells against death but the direct proofs are missing. Here, we combined several approaches to investigate GHB capacity to protect human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced death. To increase the patho-physiological relevancy of our study, we used native SH-SY5Y cells and SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with the wild-type amyloid-precursor-protein (APPwt) or control-vector-pCEP4. Trypan Blue exclusion and MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium-bromide) assays combined with pharmacological analyses showed that H2O2 reduced native and genetically modified cell viability and APPwt-transfected cells were the most vulnerable. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and activated caspase-3 staining assessed by flow cytometry revealed a basally elevated apoptotic signal in APPwt-transfected cells. Reverse-transcription, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blotting showed that mRNA and protein basal ratios of apoptotic modulators Bax/Bcl-2 were also high in APPwt-transfected cells. GHB efficiently and dose-dependently rescued native and genetically modified cells from H2O2-induced death. Interestingly, GHB, which strongly decreased elevated basal levels of TUNEL-staining, activated caspase 3-labeling and Bax/Bcl-2 in APPwt-transfected cells, also counteracted H2O2-evoked increased apoptotic markers in native and genetically modified SH-SY5Y cells. Since GHB did not promote cell proliferation, anti-apoptotic action through the down-regulation of Bax/Bcl-2 ratios and/or caspase 3 activity appears as a critical mechanism involved in GHB-induced protection of SH-SY5Y cells against APPwt-overexpression- or H2O2-evoked death. Altogether, these results, providing multi-parametric evidence for the existence of neuroprotective action of GHB, also open interesting perspectives for the development of GHB analog-based strategies against neurodegeneration or nerve cell death.

AB  - Abstract
Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to explore, for the first time, the electrophysiological correlates of the taste-visual cross-modal Stroop effect. Eighteen healthy participants were presented with a taste stimulus and a food image, and asked to categorize the image as “sweet” or “sour” by pressing the relevant button as quickly as possible. Accurate categorization of the image was faster when it was presented with a congruent taste stimulus (e.g., sour taste/image of lemon) than with an incongruent one (e.g., sour taste/image of ice cream). ERP analyses revealed a negative difference component (ND430-620) between 430 and 620 ms in the taste-visual cross-modal Stroop interference. Dipole source analysis of the difference wave (incongruent minus congruent) indicated that two generators localized in the prefrontal cortex and the parahippocampal gyrus contributed to this taste-visual cross-modal Stroop effect. This result suggests that the prefrontal cortex is associated with the process of conflict control in the taste-visual cross-modal Stroop effect. Also, we speculate that the parahippocampal gyrus is associated with the process of discordant information in the taste-visual cross-modal Stroop effect.

AB  - Abstract
Odor-evoked responses in mitral cells of the olfactory bulb are characterized by prolonged patterns of action potential (spike) activity. If downstream neurons are to respond to each spike in these patterns, the duration of the excitatory response to one spike should be limited, enabling cells to respond to subsequent spikes. To test for such mechanisms, we performed patch-clamp recordings in slices of the mouse anterior piriform cortex. Mitral cell axons in the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) were stimulated electrically at different intensities and with various frequency patterns to mimic changing input conditions that the piriform cortex likely encounters in vivo. We found with cell-attached measurements that superficial pyramidal (SP) cells in layer 2 consistently responded to LOT stimulation across conditions with a limited number (1–2) of spikes per stimulus pulse. The key synaptic feature accounting for the limited spike number appeared to be somatic inhibition derived from layer 3 fast-spiking cells. This inhibition tracked the timing of the first spike in SP cells across conditions, which naturally limited the spike number to 1–2. These response features to LOT stimulation were, moreover, not unique to SP cells, also occurring in a population of fluorescently labeled interneurons in glutamic acid decarboxylase 65-eGFP mice. That these different cortical cells respond to incoming inputs with 1–2 spikes per stimulus may be especially critical for relaying bulbar information contained in synchronized oscillations at beta (15–30 Hz) or gamma (30–80 Hz) frequencies.

AB  - Abstract
Depression is among the most debilitating diseases worldwide. Long-term exposure to stressors plays a major role in development of human depression. Chronic mild stress (CMS) seems to be a valid animal model for depression. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is capable of inferring microstructural abnormalities of the white matter and has shown to serve as non-invasive marker of specific pathology. We developed a CMS rat model of depression and validated with behavioral experiments. We measured the diffusion indices (mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA), axial (λ∥) and radial (λ⊥) diffusivity) to investigate the changes in CMS rat brain during depression onset. Diffusion indices have shown to be useful to discriminate myelin damage from axon loss. DTI was performed in both control and CMS rats (n = 10, in each group) and maps of FA, MD, λ∥ and λ⊥ diffusivity values were generated using in-house built software. The diffusion indices were calculated by region of interest (ROI) analysis in different brain regions like the frontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cingulum, thalamus, caudate putamen, corpus callosum, cerebral peduncle and sensory motor cortex. The results showed signs of demyelination, reflected by increased MD, decreased FA and increased λ⊥. The results also suggest a possible role of edema or inflammation concerning the brain morphology in CMS rats. The overall finding using DTI suggests there might be a major role of loss of myelin sheath, which leads to disrupted connectivity between the limbic area and the prefrontal cortex during the onset of depression. Our findings indicate that interpretation of these indices may provide crucial information about the type and severity of mood disorders.

AB  - Abstract
Individuated finger movements represent a key feature of hand dexterity. However, our understanding of mechanisms underlying the acquisition of this motor skill is limited. The present study aimed to identify the effects of daily motor training on acquisition of individuated finger movements. Ten musically naïve individuals performed piano practice for 4 successive days, and hand kinematics were evaluated using a motion capture system. The results showed a decrease in movement covariation across fingers with practice, particularly at the ring and little fingers. The decrease was more pronounced in the pair of fingers with lower independent control prior to the practice. Furthermore, a few finger pairs demonstrated facilitated movement independence when the subject was provided with visual feedback (VFB) regarding the rhythmic accuracy of motor actions following each practice. The results provide evidence for the enhancement of individuated finger movements through dexterous hand use during piano practice, which suggests plastic adaptation of the neuromuscular system associated with independent control of finger movement.

AB  - Abstract
The apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) allele is consistently associated with increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We investigated the molecular mechanism of this susceptibility by analyzing the levels of genes involved in AD pathogenesis in transgenic mice expressing human apoE3 or apoE4 isoforms. mRNA and protein levels of Pin1, Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), Presenilin 1 (PS1), and pro-Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) were analyzed in brain regions affected by neuropathological changes in AD.

Pin1 mRNA was significantly higher in the hippocampus of apoE4 mice than in apoE3 controls, whereas lower expression was detected in the entorhinal and parietal cortices. Reduced Pin1 levels may increase neurofibrillary degeneration and amyloidogenic processes, while compensatory mechanisms may take place in the hippocampus to balance spatial memory deficits. Sirt1 levels were significantly reduced in the frontal cortex of apoE4 mice. Sirt1 reduction may hinder its protective role against the formation of plaques and tangles and diminish its anti-inflammatory actions. Sirt1 decrease may also play a role in apoE4-associated memory impairments. Moreover, in apoE4 mice PS1 mRNA levels were lower in the frontal cortex. Lower PS1 expression may hamper γ-secretase function, thus affecting amyloid precursor protein processing. Pro-BDNF mRNA levels did not differ between apoE3 and apoE4 mice in any region analyzed.

This study showed dysregulated expression of Pin1, Sirt1, and PS1 genes in different cerebral areas of apoE4 mice, suggesting that these changes may play a role in the mechanism of AD vulnerability.

During a study of spinal cord injury (SCI), mice in our colony were treated with the anthelmintic fenbendazole to treat pinworms detected in other mice not involved in the study. As this was not part of the original experimental design, we subsequently compared pathological and functional outcomes of SCI in female C57BL/6 mice who received fenbendazole (150 ppm, 8 mg/kg body weight/day) for 4 weeks prior to moderate contusive SCI (50 kdyn force) as compared to mice on the same diet without added fenbendazole. The fenbendazole-treated mice exhibited improved locomotor function, determined using the Basso mouse scale, as well as improved tissue sparing following contusive SCI. Fenbendazole may exert protective effects through multiple possible mechanisms, one of which is inhibition of the proliferation of B lymphocytes, thereby reducing antibody responses. Autoantibodies produced following SCI contribute to the axon damage and locomotor deficits. Fenbendazole pretreatment reduced the injury-induced CD45R-positive B cell signal intensity and IgG immunoreactivity at the lesion epicenter 6 weeks after contusive SCI in mice, consistent with a possible effect on the immune response to the injury. Fenbendazole and related benzimadole antihelmintics are FDA approved, exhibit minimal toxicity, and represent a novel group of potential therapeutics targeting secondary mechanisms following SCI.

AB  - Abstract
Autophagy is responsible for the bulk degradation of cytoplasmic contents including organelles through the lysosomal machinery. Neonatal hypoxia–ischemia (HI) causes cell death in the brain by caspase-dependent and independent pathways. Ischemic insults also increase the formation of autophagosomes and activate autophagy. This study assessed the possible sex- and region-specific differences of autophagy activity in neonates subjected to HI brain injury. HI males had a modest decrease in lysosome numbers with no effect on LC3B-II protein in the cortex. In contrast, HI females had decreased lysosome numbers and their LC3B-II protein expression was significantly increased in the cortex following HI. In the hippocampus, both HI males and all females had increased numbers of autolysosomes suggesting activation of autophagy but with no effect on lysosome numbers, or Beclin-1 or LC3B protein levels. Males and females had increases in caspase 3/7 activity in their cortices and hippocampi following HI, though the increases were three to sixfold greater in females. The present data: (a) confirm greater caspase activation in the brains of females compared to males following HI; (b) suggest a partial failure to degrade LC3B-II protein in cortical but not hippocampal lysosomes of females as compared to males following neonatal HI; (c) all females have greater basal autophagy activity than males which may protect cells against injury by increasing cell turnover and (d) demonstrate that autophagy pathways are disturbed in regional- and sex-specific patterns in the rat brain following neonatal HI.

AB  - Abstract
Modulation of L-type Ca2+-channel function by dopamine is a major determinant of the rate of action potential firing by striatal medium spiny neurons. However, the role of these channels in modulating GABA release by nerve terminals in the basal ganglia is unknown. We found that depolarization-induced [3H]GABA release in both the substantia nigra reticulata and the external globus pallidus (GPe), was depressed by about 50% by either the selective L-channel dihydropyridine blocker nifedipine or the P/Q channel blocker ω-agatoxin TK. The effects of these blockers were additive and together eliminated about 90% of depolarization-induced [3H]GABA release. In addition, in the substantia nigra reticulata, dihydropyridines prevented both the stimulation of [3H]GABA release produced by dopamine D1 receptor activation and the inhibition caused by D4 receptor activation. In the GP nifedipine blocked the effects of D2 and A2A receptor coactivation as well as the effects of activating adenylyl cyclase with forskolin. ω-Agatoxin TK did not interfere with the action of these modulatory agents. The L-type Ca2+-channel agonist BAYK 8644 stimulated GABA release in both substantia nigra reticulata and GP. Because dihydropyridine sensitivity is a key criterion to identify L-type Ca2+-channel activity, our results imply that these channels are determinant of GABA release modulation by dopamine in striatonigral, striatopallidal and pallidonigral terminals.

AB  - Abstract
This study investigates the role of phonology in reading logographic Chinese. Specifically, whether phonological information is obligatorily activated in reading Chinese two-character compounds was examined using the masked-priming paradigm with event-related potential (ERP) recordings. Twenty-two native Cantonese Chinese speakers participated in a lexical decision experiment. The targets were visually presented Chinese two-character strings and the participants were asked to judge whether the target in each trial was a legitimate compound word in Chinese. Each target was preceded by a briefly presented word prime. The prime and target shared an identical constituent character in the Character-related condition, a syllable in the Syllable-related condition, were semantically related in the Semantic-related condition, and were unrelated (both phonologically and semantically) in the control condition. The prime–target relationship was manipulated to probe the effects of word-form (i.e., character- or syllable-relatedness) and word-semantic relatedness on phonological (as indexed by an N250 ERP component) and semantic (as indexed by an N400 ERP component) processing. Significant and comparable facilitation effects in reaction time, relative to the control, were observed in the Character-related and the Semantic-related conditions. Furthermore, a significant reduction in ERP amplitudes (N250), relative to the control, was obtained in the Character-related condition in the time window of 150–250 ms post target. In addition, attenuation in ERP amplitudes was found in the Semantic-related condition in the window of 250–500 ms (N400). However, no significant results (neither behavioral nor ERP) were found in the Syllable-related condition. These results suggest that phonological activation is not mandatory and the role of phonology is minimal at best in reading Chinese two-character compounds.

Mitochondrial division inhibitor 1 (mdivi-1), a selective inhibitor of mitochondrial fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), has been reported to display neuroprotective properties in different animal models. In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of mdivi-1 on β-amyloid protein (Aβ)-induced cytotoxicity and its potential mechanisms in BV-2 and primary microglial cells. We found that mitochondrial fission was increased in Aβ treatment and inhibition of mitochondrial fission by mdivi-1 significantly reduced Aβ-induced expression of CD11b (a marker of microglial activation), viability loss and apoptotic rate increase in BV-2 and primary microglial cells. Moreover, we also found that mdivi-1 treatment markedly reversed mitochondrial membrane potential loss, cytochrome c (CytC) release and caspase-3 activation. Altogether, our data suggested that mdivi-1 exerts neuroprotective effects against Aβ-induced microglial apoptosis, and the underlying mechanism may be through inhibiting mitochondrial membrane potential loss, CytC release and suppression of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway.

AB  - Abstract
Protection of motoneurons is an important goal in the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI). We tested whether neuroprotective microRNAs (miRs) like miR-206, miR-17, miR-21, miR-7-1, and miR-106a could enhance efficacy of estrogen receptor (ER) agonists such as 1,3,5-tris (4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-propyl-1H-pyrazole (PPT, ERα agonist), Way200070 (WAY, ERβ agonist), and estrogen (EST, ERα and ERβ agonist) in preventing apoptosis in the calcium ionophore (CI)-insulted ventral spinal cord 4.1 (VSC4.1) motoneurons. We determined that 200 nM CI induced 70% cell death. Treatment with 50 nM PPT, 100 nM WAY, and 150 nM EST induced overexpression of ERα, ERβ, and both receptors, respectively, at mRNA and protein levels. Treatment with ER agonists significantly upregulated miR-206, miR-17, and miR-7-1 in the CI-insulted VSC4.1 motoneurons. Transfection with miR-206, miR-17, or miR-7-1 mimic potentiated WAY or EST to inhibit apoptosis in the CI-insulted VSC4.1 motoneurons. Overexpression of miR-7-1 maximally increased efficacy of WAY and EST for down regulation of pro-apoptotic Bax and upregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. A search using microRNA database (miRDB) indicated that miR-7-1 could inhibit the expression of L-type Ca2+ channel protein alpha 1C (CPα1C). miR-7-1 overexpression and WAY or EST treatment down regulated CPα1C but upregulated p-Akt to trigger cell survival signaling. The same therapeutic strategy increased expression of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II beta (CaMKIIβ) and the phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (p-CREB) so as to promote Bcl-2 transcription. Whole cell membrane potential and mitochondrial membrane potential studies indicated that miR-7-1 highly potentiated EST to preserve functionality in the CI-insulted VSC4.1 motoneurons. In conclusion, our data indicated that miR-7-1 most significantly potentiated efficacy of EST for functional neuroprotection and this therapeutic strategy could be used in the future to attenuate apoptosis of motoneurons in SCI.

AB  - Abstract
Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is present in the superficial laminae of the dorsal horn and inhibits spinal nociceptive processing, but the mechanisms underlying its anti-hyperalgesic actions are unclear. We hypothesized that NPY acts at neuropeptide Y1 receptors in the dorsal horn to decrease nociception by inhibiting substance P (SP) release, and that these effects are enhanced by inflammation. To evaluate SP release, we used microdialysis and neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) internalization in rat. NPY decreased capsaicin-evoked SP-like immunoreactivity in the microdialysate of the dorsal horn. NPY also decreased non-noxious stimulus (paw brush)-evoked NK1R internalization (as well as mechanical hyperalgesia and mechanical and cold allodynia) after intraplantar injection of carrageenan. Similarly, in rat spinal cord slices with dorsal root attached, [Leu31, Pro34]-NPY inhibited dorsal root stimulus-evoked NK1R internalization. In rat dorsal root ganglion neurons, Y1 receptors colocalized extensively with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). In dorsal horn neurons, Y1 receptors were extensively expressed and this may have masked the detection of terminal co-localization with CGRP or SP. To determine whether the pain inhibitory actions of Y1 receptors are enhanced by inflammation, we administered [Leu31, Pro34]-NPY after intraplantar injection of complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) in rat. We found that [Leu31, Pro34]-NPY reduced paw clamp-induced NK1R internalization in CFA rats but not uninjured controls. To determine the contribution of increased Y1 receptor-G protein coupling, we measured [35S]GTPγS binding simulated by [Leu31, Pro34]-NPY in mouse dorsal horn. CFA inflammation increased the affinity of Y1 receptor G-protein coupling. We conclude that Y1 receptors contribute to the anti-hyperalgesic effects of NPY by mediating the inhibition of SP release, and that Y1 receptor signaling in the dorsal horn is enhanced during inflammatory nociception.

AB  - Abstract
Progesterone (PROG) is promising as an important protective agent against various injuries to the nervous system. The present study was designed to investigate whether starting PROG administration, when symptomatology is already established, would alleviate the expression of nociceptive behaviors (mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia) and electrophysiological changes in a chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain in rats. Male rats were given PROG (1.5, 3, 6 and 12 mg/kg, i.p.) 12 days after CCI induction, and dosing continued daily until day 26. Behavioral tests were done immediately before surgery (day 0) and on days 12, 26, 28, and 35 post-CCI, and were followed by electrophysiological measurements in the last day. PROG at doses of 6 or 12 mg/kg reduced both the thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia induced by CCI. Electrophysiological data indicated that CCI-induced animals had a remarkable decrement of both compound muscle and nerve action potential amplitudes recorded in the gastrocnemius muscle and sural nerve, respectively. CCI also caused a significant reduction in motor and sensory conduction velocities measured in the sural and tibial nerves, respectively. PROG at doses of 6 or 12 mg/kg induced a significant recovery of all electrophysiological changes. Our data indicated that starting PROG therapy when symptomatology is already established, and continuing it for a sufficient period of time, may have a therapeutic effect. This suggests that PROG may offer new strategies for the treatment of neuropathic pain.

AB  - Abstract
Numerous studies have provided evidence regarding the involvement of protein S-nitrosylation in the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology and its implication in the formation and accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates. The identification of S-nitrosylated proteins can be a major step toward the understanding of mechanisms leading to neuronal degeneration.

The present study targeted S-nitrosylated proteins in AD hippocampus, substantia nigra and cortex using the following work-flow that combines S-nitrosothiol-specific antibody detection, classical biotin switch method labeled with fluorescence dye followed by electrospray ionization quadrupole time of flight tandem MS (ESI-QTOF MS/MS) identification. Endogenous nitrosocysteines were identified in 45 proteins, mainly involved in metabolism, signaling pathways, apoptosis and redox regulation as assigned by REACTOME and KEGG pathway database analysis. Superoxide dismutase (SOD2) [Mn], fructose-bisphosphate aldolase C (ALDOC) and voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 2 (VDAC2) showed differential S-nitrosylation signal, not previously reported in AD regions. Extensive neuronal atrophy with increased protein S-nitrosylation in AD regions is also evident from immunofluorescence studies using S-nitrosocysteine antibody. A number of plausible cysteine modification sites were predicted via Group-based Prediction System-S-nitrosothiols (GPS-SNO) 1.0 while STRING 8.3 analysis revealed functional annotations in the modified proteins. The findings are helpful in characterization of functional abnormalities and may facilitate the understanding of molecular mechanisms and biological function of S-nitrosylation in AD pathology.

AB  - Abstract
Perinatal nutrient restriction exerts profound influences on brain development. Animals that suffer undernutrition during lactation also display impaired weight gain. Feeding behavior is mainly modulated by neural and hormonal inputs to the hypothalamus. The arcuate–paraventricular neuropeptidergic Y pathway has a prominent role in appetite regulation. The aim of this work was to study the effects of protein undernutrition during lactation on this hypothalamic pathway. We used rats from 5 to 60 postnatal (P) days whose dams were fed a 0% protein diet (PFG) or a normoprotein diet (CG) from P1 to P10. To reproduce the same amount of calorie ingested by the PFG we used an underfed group (UFG). Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess neuropeptide Y (NPY) distribution in the arcuate, periventricular and paraventricular nuclei. Our results showed a NPY immunostaining peak at P10 in all nuclei in CG animals. In UFG animals this peak was observed by P15, while, in the PFG animals only by P20. Our results suggest that the neuropeptidergic arcuate–paraventricular pathway suffered a delay in NPY distribution in undernourished animals, particularly those fed a 0% protein diet, reflecting an effect on this pathway maturation that could explain previously reported alterations on feeding behavior in these animals.

AB  - Abstract
Verbal insight problem solving means to break mental sets, to select the novel semantic information and to form novel, task-related associations. Although previous studies have identified the brain regions associated with these key processes, the interaction among these regions during insight is still unclear. In the present study, we explored the functional connectivity between the key regions during solving Chinese ‘chengyu’ riddles by using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results showed that both insight and noninsight solutions activated the bilateral inferior frontal gyri, middle temporal gyri and hippocampi, and these regions constituted a frontal to temporal to hippocampal neural pathway. Compared with noninsight solution, insight solution had a stronger functional connectivity between the inferior frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus in the right hemisphere. Our study reveals the neural pathway of information processing during verbal insight problem solving, and supports the right-hemisphere advantage theory of insight.

AB  - Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by progressive dopamine (DA) depletion in the striatum. Exercise has been shown to be a promising non-pharmacological approach to reduce the risk of neurodegeneration diseases. This study was designed to investigate the potential neuroprotective effect of swimming training (ST) in a mouse model of PD induced by 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in mice. The present study demonstrated that a 4-week ST was effective in attenuating the following impairments resulting from 6-OHDA exposure: (i) depressive-like behavior in the tail suspension test; (ii) increase in the number of falls in the rotarod test; (iii) impairment on long-term memory in the object recognition test; (iv) increase of the reactive species and interleukin 1-beta (IL-1β) levels; (v) inhibition of the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity; (vi) rise of the glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities and vii) decrease of DA, homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels. The mechanisms involved in this study are the modulation of GPx, GR and GST activities as well as IL-1β level in a PD model induced by 6-OHDA, protecting against the decrease of DA, DOPAC and HVA levels in the striatum of mice. These findings reinforce that one of the effects induced by exercise on neurodegenerative disease, such as PD, is due to antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. We suggest that exercise attenuates cognitive and motor declines, depression, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation induced by 6-OHDA supporting the hypothesis that exercise can be used as a non-pharmacological tool to reduce the symptoms of PD.

AB  - Abstract
In female mammals, the postpartum period involves dramatic shifts in many socioemotional behaviors. This includes a suppression of anxiety-related behaviors that requires recent physical contact with offspring. Factors contributing to differences among females in their susceptibility to the anxiety-modulating effect of offspring contact are unknown, but could include their innate anxiety and brain monoaminergic activity. Anxiety behavior was assessed in a large group of nulliparous female rats and the least-anxious and most-anxious tertiles were mated. Anxiety was assessed again postpartum after females were permitted or prevented from contacting their offspring 4 h before testing. Levels of dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH, norepinephrine synthesizing enzyme) and tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (TPH2, serotonin synthesizing enzyme) were measured in the brainstem and dorsal raphe, respectively. It was found that anxiety-related behavior in the two groups did not differ when dams were permitted contact with offspring before testing. Removal of the offspring before testing, however, differentially affected anxiety based on dams’ innate anxiety. Specifically, dams reverted back to their pre-mating levels of anxiety such that offspring removal slightly increased anxiety in the most-anxious females but greatly lowered anxiety in the least-anxious females. This reduction in anxiety in the least-anxious females after litter removal was associated with lower brainstem DBH. There was no relationship between females’ anxiety and dorsal raphe TPH2. Thus, a primary effect of recent contact with offspring on anxiety-related behavior in postpartum rats is to shift females away from their innate anxiety to a more moderate level of responding. This effect is particularly true for females with the lowest anxiety, may be mediated by central noradrenergic systems, and has implications for their ability to attend to their offspring.

AB  - Abstract
We have previously demonstrated that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist ameliorated neurodegenerative changes in rat models of diabetes-related Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and protected neurons from glucose toxicity in vitro. Herein, we investigated the effects of GLP-1 receptor mediates on cell toxicity and tau hyperphosphorylation induced by advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are associated with glucose toxicity, and the molecular mechanism in PC12 cells and the primary hippocampal neurons. Our study demonstrated that the similar protection effects of GLP-1 existed in PC12 cells treated with glucose–bovine serum albumin (BSA) in hyperglycemic conditions or with glycoaldehyde–BSA alone. Additionally, glucose–BSA alone did not induce significant cytotoxicity in PC12 cells, but resulted in tau hyperphosphorylation in primary hippocampal neurons in 24 h. And we found that GLP-1 could reduce cell tau phosphorylation induced by high glucose or glucose–BSA. Furthermore, our data in the present study suggested that GLP-1 regulated tau phosphorylation induced by AGEs through a signaling pathway involving glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β), similarly to the GSK-3β inhibitor, lithium chloride. Our findings suggest that GLP-1 can protect neurons from diabetes-associated AGE insults in vitro, and provide new evidence for a potential therapeutic value of GLP-1 receptor agonist in the treatment of AD especially diabetes-related AD.

AB  - Abstract
Tinnitus is a bothersome phantom sound percept and its neural correlates are not yet disentangled. Previously published papers, using [18F]-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), have suggested an increased metabolism in the left primary auditory cortex in tinnitus patients. This unilateral hyperactivity has been used as a target in localized treatments such as transcranial magnetic stimulation. The purpose of the current study was to test whether left-sided hyperactivity in the auditory cortex is specific to tinnitus or is a general characteristic of the auditory system unrelated to tinnitus. Therefore, FDG-PET was used to measure brain metabolism in 20 tinnitus patients and to compare their results to those in 19 control subjects without tinnitus. In contrast to our expectation, there was no hyperactivity associated with tinnitus. Nevertheless, the activity in the left primary auditory cortex was higher than in the right primary auditory cortex, but this asymmetry was present in both tinnitus patients and control subjects. In contrast, the lateralization in secondary auditory cortex was opposite, with higher activation in the right hemisphere. These data show that hemisphere asymmetries in the metabolic resting activity of the auditory cortex are present, but these are not associated with tinnitus and are a normal characteristic of the normal brain.

AB  - Abstract
Adaptation is an important process of sensory systems to adjust sensitivity to ensure the appropriate information encoding. Sensitivity and kinetics of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) responses have been studied extensively using a brief flash superimposed on different but steady backgrounds. However, it is still unclear if light adaptation exerts any effect on more complex response properties, such as response nonlinearity. In this study, we found that the latency of spike responses to a repeated flashing spot stimulation increased by 30 ms in the mouse ON α RGCs (An ON-type RGC is excited when a spot is turned on in the center of its receptive field). A single dimming event preceding the test flash on a steady adapting background could also produce similar effect in increasing latency of light responses. A simple computational model with a linear transformation of the light stimulus and a threshold-like nonlinearity could account for the experimental data. Moreover, the strength of the measured nonlinearity and the response latency were affected by the duration of light adaptation. The possible biological processes underlying this nonlinearity were explored. Voltage clamp recording revealed the presence of the increase in latency and threshold-like nonlinearity in the excitatory input of RGCs. However, no comparable nonlinearity was observed in the light responses of the ON cone bipolar cells. We further excluded GABAergic and glycinergic inhibition, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor rectification and voltage-gated Na+ channels as potential sources of this nonlinearity by pharmacological experiments. Our results indicate the bipolar cell terminals as the potential site of nonlinearity. Computational modeling constrained by experimental data supports that conclusion and suggests the voltage-sensitive Ca++ channels and Ca++-dependent vesicle release in the bipolar cell terminals as mechanistic basis.

AB  - Abstract
Neuroinflammatory disturbances have been closely associated with depression and many other neuropsychiatric diseases. Although targeting neuroinflammatory mediators with centrally acting drugs has shown certain promise, its translation is faced with several challenges especially drug delivery and safety concerns. Here, we report that neuroinflammation-induced behavioral abnormality could be effectively attenuated with immunomodulatory agents that need not to gain brain penetration. In a rat model with intracerebral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge, we validated that ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1), a well-established anti-inflammatory agent, was unable to produce a direct action in the brain. Interestingly, peripherally restricted Rg1 could effectively attenuate the weight loss, anorexic- and depressive-like behavior as well as neurochemical disturbances associated with central LPS challenge. Biochemical assay of neuroimmune mediators in the periphery revealed that Rg1 could mitigate the deregulation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and selectively blunt the increase in circulating interleukin-6 levels. Furthermore, these peripheral regulatory effects were accompanied by dampened microglial activation, mitigated expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and neurotoxic species in the central compartment. Taken together, our work suggested that targeting the peripheral immune system may serve as a novel therapeutic approach to neuroinflammation-induced neuropsychiatric disorders. Moreover, our findings provided the rationale for employing peripherally active agents like Rg1 to combat mental disturbances.

AB  - Abstract
Recent studies have demonstrated that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) modulates cortical activity in the human brain. In the language domain, it has already been shown that during a naming task tDCS reduces vocal reaction times in healthy individuals and speeds up the recovery process in left brain-damaged aphasic subjects. In this study, we wondered whether tDCS would influence the ability to articulate tongue twisters during a repetition task. Three groups of 10 healthy individuals were asked to repeat a list of tongue twisters in three different stimulation conditions: one group performed the task during anodal tDCS (atDCS) (20 min, 2 mA) over the left frontal region; a second group during cathodal tDCS delivered over the same region; and, in a third group, sham stimulation was applied. Accuracy and vocal reaction times in repeating each tongue twister before, during and 1 h after the stimulation were recorded. Participants were more accurate and faster at repeating the stimuli during atDCS than at baseline, while cathodal tDCS significantly reduced their performance in terms of accuracy and reaction times. No significant differences were observed among the three time points during the sham condition.

We believe that these data clearly confirm that the left frontal region is critically involved in the process of speech repetition. They are also in line with recent evidence suggesting that frontal tDCS might be used as a therapeutic tool in patients suffering from articulatory deficits.

AB  - Abstract
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disorder afflicting 2% of the population older than 65 years worldwide. Recently, brain organotypic slices have been used to model neurodegenerative disorders, including PD. They conserve brain three-dimensional architecture, synaptic connectivity and its microenvironment. This model has allowed researchers a simple and rapid method to observe cellular interactions and mechanisms. In the present study, we developed an organotypic PD model from rat brains that includes all the areas involved in the nigrostriatal pathway in a single slice preparation, without using neurotoxins to induce the dopaminergic lesion. The mechanical transection of the nigrostriatal pathway obtained during slice preparation induced PD-like histopathology. Progressive nigrostriatal degeneration was monitored combining innovative approaches, such as diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-RMI) to follow fiber degeneration and mass spectrometry to quantify striatal dopamine content, together with bright-field and fluorescence microscopy imaging. A substantia nigra dopaminergic cell number decrease was observed by immunohistochemistry against rat tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) reaching 80% after 2 days in culture associated with a 30% decrease of striatal TH-positive fiber density, a 15% loss of striatal dopamine content quantified by mass spectrometry and a 70% reduction of nigrostriatal fiber fractional anisotropy quantified by DT-RMI. In addition, a significant decline of medium spiny neuron density was observed from days 7 to 16. These sagittal organotypic slices could be used to study the early stage of PD, namely dopaminergic degeneration, and the late stage of the pathology with dopaminergic and GABAergic neuron loss. This novel model might improve the understanding of PD and may represent a promising tool to refine the evaluation of new therapeutic approaches.

AB  - Abstract
Multisensory integration has been widely studied in neurons of the mammalian superior colliculus (SC). This has led to the description of various determinants of multisensory integration, including those based on stimulus- and neuron-specific factors. The most widely characterized of these illustrate the importance of the spatial and temporal relationships of the paired stimuli as well as their relative effectiveness in eliciting a response in determining the final integrated output. Although these stimulus-specific factors have generally been considered in isolation (i.e., manipulating stimulus location while holding all other factors constant), they have an intrinsic interdependency that has yet to be fully elucidated. For example, changes in stimulus location will likely also impact both the temporal profile of response and the effectiveness of the stimulus. The importance of better describing this interdependency is further reinforced by the fact that SC neurons have large receptive fields, and that responses at different locations within these receptive fields are far from equivalent. To address these issues, the current study was designed to examine the interdependency between the stimulus factors of space and effectiveness in dictating the multisensory responses of SC neurons. The results show that neuronal responsiveness changes dramatically with changes in stimulus location – highlighting a marked heterogeneity in the spatial receptive fields of SC neurons. More importantly, this receptive field heterogeneity played a major role in the integrative product exhibited by stimulus pairings, such that pairings at weakly responsive locations of the receptive fields resulted in the largest multisensory interactions. Together these results provide greater insight into the interrelationship of the factors underlying multisensory integration in SC neurons, and may have important mechanistic implications for multisensory integration and the role it plays in shaping SC-mediated behaviors.

AB  - Abstract
A shift in GABAA signaling from inhibition to excitation in primary afferent neurons appears to contribute to the inflammation-induced increase in afferent input to the CNS. An activity-dependent depolarization of the GABAA current equilibrium potential (EGABA) has been described in CNS neurons which drives a shift in GABAA signaling from inhibition to excitation. The purpose of the present study was to determine if such an activity-dependent depolarization of EGABA occurs in primary afferents and whether the depolarization is amplified with persistent inflammation. Acutely dissociated retrogradely labeled cutaneous dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from naïve and inflamed rats were studied with gramicidin perforated patch recording. Rather than a depolarization, 200 action potentials delivered at 2 Hz resulted in a ∼10 mV hyperpolarization of EGABA in cutaneous neurons from naïve rats. No such hyperpolarization was observed in neurons from inflamed rats. The shift in EGABA was not blocked by 10 μM bumetanide. Furthermore, because activity-dependent hyperpolarization of EGABA was fully manifest in the absence of HCO3− in the bath solution, this shift was not dependent on a change in HCO3−–Cl− exchanger activity, despite evidence of HCO3−–Cl− exchangers in DRG neurons that may contribute to the establishment of EGABA in the presence of HCO3−. While the mechanism underlying the activity-dependent hyperpolarization of EGABA has yet to be identified, because this mechanism appears to function as a form of feedback inhibition, facilitating GABA-mediated inhibition of afferent activity, it may serve as a novel target for the treatment of inflammatory pain.

Children with low aerobic fitness have altered brain function compared to higher-fit children. This study examined the effect of an 8-month exercise intervention on resting state synchrony. Twenty-two sedentary, overweight (body mass index ⩾85th percentile) children 8–11 years old were randomly assigned to one of two after-school programs: aerobic exercise (n = 13) or sedentary attention control (n = 9). Before and after the 8-month programs, all subjects participated in resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. Independent components analysis identified several networks, with four chosen for between-group analysis: salience, default mode, cognitive control, and motor networks. The default mode, cognitive control, and motor networks showed more spatial refinement over time in the exercise group compared to controls. The motor network showed increased synchrony in the exercise group with the right medial frontal gyrus compared to controls. Exercise behavior may enhance brain development in children.

AB  - Abstract
In this study we were interested in the neural system supporting the audiovisual (AV) integration of emotional expression and emotional prosody. To this end normal participants were exposed to short videos of a computer-animated face voicing emotionally positive or negative words with the appropriate prosody. Facial expression of the face was either neutral or emotionally appropriate. To reveal the neural network involved in affective AV integration, standard univariate analysis of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) data was followed by a random-effects Granger causality mapping (RFX-GCM). The regions that distinguished emotional from neutral facial expressions in the univariate analysis were taken as seed regions. In trials showing emotional expressions compared to neutral trials univariate analysis showed activation primarily in bilateral amygdala, fusiform gyrus, middle temporal gyrus/superior temporal sulcus and inferior occipital gyrus. When employing either the left amygdala or the right amygdala as a seed region in RFX-GCM we found connectivity with the right hemispheric fusiform gyrus, with the indication that the fusiform gyrus sends information to the Amygdala. These results led to a working model for face perception in general and for AV-affective integration in particular which is an elaborated adaptation of existing models.

AB  - Abstract
In the central nervous system, the normal development of neuronal circuits requires adequate temporal activation of receptors for individual neurotransmitters. Previous studies have demonstrated that α2-adrenoceptor (α2-AR) activation eliminates spontaneous action potentials of interneurons in the cerebellar molecular layer (MLIs) and subsequently reduces the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in Purkinje cells (PCs) after the second postnatal week. The magnitude of the α2-adrenergic reduction in sIPSC frequency is enhanced during the third postnatal week because of an increase in firing-derived sIPSCs. However, little is known about the effects of α2-AR activation by noradrenaline (NA) on cerebellar GABAergic synaptic transmission that is accompanied by the activation of other AR subtypes, α1- and β-ARs. Here, we developmentally examined the roles of α2-AR activation in the noradrenergic facilitation of sIPSCs in cerebellar PCs. Until the second postnatal week, when substantial inhibitory effects of α2-ARs are absent, NA potentiated sIPSCs and maintained the increased sIPSC frequency, suggesting that NA causes long-lasting facilitation of GABAergic synaptic transmission through α1- and β-AR activation. After the second postnatal week, NA transiently increased the sIPSC frequency, whereas blocking α2-ARs sustained the noradrenergic sIPSC facilitation and increase in the firing rate of MLIs, suggesting that α2-AR activation suppresses the noradrenergic facilitation of GABAergic synaptic transmission. The simultaneous activation of α1- and β-ARs by their specific agonists mimicked the persistent facilitation of sIPSC frequency, which required extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation. These findings indicate that NA acts as a neurotrophic factor that strengthens GABAergic synaptic transmission in the developing cerebellar cortex and that α2-ARs temporally restrain the noradrenergic facilitation of sIPSCs after GABAergic synaptogenesis.

AB  - Abstract
Tissue damage during the neonatal period evokes long-lasting changes in nociceptive processing within the adult spinal cord which contribute to persistent alterations in pain sensitivity. However, it remains unclear if the observed modifications in neuronal activity within the mature superficial dorsal horn (SDH) following early injury reflect shifts in the intrinsic membrane properties of these cells. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to identify the effects of neonatal surgical injury on the intrinsic excitability of both GABAergic and presumed glutamatergic neurons within lamina II of the adult SDH using in vitro patch clamp recordings from spinal cord slices prepared from glutamic acid decarboxylase-green fluorescent protein (Gad-GFP) mice. The results demonstrate that hindpaw surgical incision at postnatal day (P) 3 altered the passive membrane properties of both Gad-GFP and adjacent, non-GFP neurons in the mature SDH, as evidenced by decreased membrane resistance and more negative resting potentials in comparison to naïve littermate controls. This was accompanied by a reduction in the prevalence of spontaneous activity within the GABAergic population. Both Gad-GFP and non-GFP neurons displayed a significant elevation in rheobase and decreased instantaneous firing frequency after incision, suggesting that early tissue damage lowers the intrinsic membrane excitability of adult SDH neurons. Isolation of inward-rectifying K+ (Kir) currents revealed that neonatal incision significantly increased Kir conductance near physiological membrane potentials in GABAergic, but not glutamatergic, lamina II neurons. Overall, these findings suggest that neonatal tissue injury causes a long-term dampening of intrinsic firing across the general population of lamina II interneurons, but the underlying ionic mechanisms may be cell-type specific.

AB  - Abstract
Diabetes type 1 is a common autoimmune disease manifesting by insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia, which can lead to dementia-like brain dysfunctions. The factors triggering the pathological processes in hyperglycemic brain remain unknown. We reported in this study that brain areas with different susceptibility to diabetes (prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum) revealed differential alterations in ceramide (Cer) and sphingomyelin (SM) profiles in rats with streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia. Employing gas–liquid chromatography, we found that level of total Cer increased significantly only in the PFC of diabetic animals, which also exhibited a broad spectrum of sphingolipid (SLs) changes, such as elevations of Cer-C16:0, -C18:0, -C20:0, -C22:0, -C18:1, -C24:1 and SM-C16:0 and -C18:1. In opposite, only minor changes were noted in other examined structures. In addition, de novo synthesis pathway could play a role in generation of Cer containing monounsaturated fatty acids in PFC during hyperglycemia. In turn, simultaneous accumulation of Cers and their SM counterparts may suggest that overproduced Cers are converted to SMs to avoid excessive Cer-mediated cytotoxicity. We conclude that broad changes in SLs compositions in PFC induced by hyperglycemia may provoke membrane rearrangements in some cell populations, which can disturb cellular signaling and cause tissue damage.

AB  - Abstract
Kainic acid (KA) administration is known to cause seizures and neuronal death in the hippocampus. High-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the hippocampus can be a promising method in the treatment of epilepsy while the mechanism of action is unknown yet. It remains unknown whether HFS is neuroprotective for hippocampal neurons following KA-induced seizures in macaques, although HFS has neuroprotective effects in animal models of Parkinson’s disease. We therefore examined the effects of HFS on KA-induced seizures and neuronal survival in macaque’s hippocampus. Seizure frequency following KA that led to seizures in macaques was strongly reduced by HFS of the hippocampus. In addition, administration of KA led to marked neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus, accompanied by increased levels of Bax, activated caspase-3 and decreased levels of Bcl-2. HFS was found to attenuate changes in apoptosis-related proteins and robustly decreased neuronal loss following KA administration. These data indicate that hippocampal HFS can protect hippocampal neurons against KA neurotoxicity, and that HFS neuroprotection is likely to operate with inhibition of apoptosis.

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has been implicated in the transmission of nociceptive input in diabetic neuropathy. The aim of this study was to test whether intraganglionic (i.g.) injection of CaMKII inhibitors may alleviate pain-related behavior in diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in Sprague–Dawley rats using 55 mg/kg streptozotocin intraperitoneally. Two weeks after diabetes induction, CaMKII inhibitors myristoil-AIP and KN93 were injected directly into the right L5 dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Behavioral testing with mechanical and thermal stimuli was performed before induction of diabetes, the day preceding the injection, as well as 2 and 24 h after the i.g. injection. The expression of total CaMKII and its alpha isoform in DRG neurons was analyzed using immunohistochemistry. CaMKII inhibitors attenuated pain-related behavior in a modality-specific fashion. Attenuation of nociceptive behavior was accompanied with a corresponding decrease of CaMKII alpha expression in DRG neurons on the side of injection. A significant decrease of CaMKII alpha expression was seen in small- and medium-sized neurons. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that CaMKII inhibitors are potential pharmacological agents that should be further explored for treatment of diabetic neuropathy symptoms.

AB  - Abstract
Light stimulates specialized retinal ganglion cells to release glutamate (Glu) onto circadian clock neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Glu resets the phase of the SCN circadian clock by activating N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) causing either delays or advances in the clock phase, depending on early- or late-night stimulation, respectively. In addition, these Glu-induced phase shifts require tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptor activity. Previous studies show that copper (Cu) released at hippocampal synapses can inhibit NMDAR activity, and application of exogenous Cu likewise inhibits NMDAR activity. We investigated the effects of Cu in acute SCN brain slices prepared from C57BL/6Nhsd adult, male mice using treatments that decrease or increase available Cu levels in vitro and recorded neuronal activity on the following day. When bath-applied for 10 min at zeitgeber time (ZT) 16 (where ZT0 = lights-on in the donor animal colony), the Cu-specific chelators tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) and bathocuproine disulfonate each induce ∼2.5–3-h phase delays in circadian neuronal activity rhythms, similarly to Glu-induced phase delays. Co-application of 10 μM CuCl2, but not 10 μM CoCl2 blocks TTM-induced phase delays. Furthermore, TTM causes phase advances when applied at ZT23. At both application times, TTM-induced phase shifts are blocked by NMDA or TrkB receptor antagonists. Surprisingly, bath-application of 10 μM Cu alone also induces phase shifts in analogous experiments at ZT16 and ZT23. Inhibiting NMDAR does not block Cu-induced phase shifts. TrkB inhibition blocks Cu-induced phase delays but not phase advances. Thus, increasing and decreasing Cu availability appear to shift the SCN clock phase through different mechanisms, at least at the receptor level. We propose that Cu plays a role in the SCN circadian clock by modulating Glu signaling.

AB  - Abstract
The spatial pattern of synapse activation may impact on synaptic plasticity. This applies to the synaptically-evoked endocannabinoid-mediated short-term depression at the parallel fiber (PF) to Purkinje cell synapse, the occurrence of which requires close proximity between the activated synapses. Here, we determine quantitatively this required proximity, helped by the geometrical organization of the cerebellar molecular layer. Transgenic mice expressing a calcium indicator selectively in granule cells enabled the imaging of action potential-evoked presynaptic calcium rise in isolated, single PFs. This measurement was used to derive the number of PFs activated within a beam of PFs stimulated in the molecular layer, from which the density of activated PFs (input density) was calculated. This density was on average 2.8 μm−2 in sagittal slices and twice more in transverse slices. The synaptically-evoked endocannabinoid-mediated suppression of excitation (SSE) evoked by ten stimuli at 200 Hz was determined from the monitoring of either postsynaptic responses or presynaptic calcium rise. The SSE was significantly larger when recorded in transverse slices, where the input density is larger. The exponential description of the SSE plotted as a function of the input density suggests that the SSE is half reduced when the input density decreases from 6 to 2 μm−2. We conclude that, although all PFs are truncated in an acute sagittal slice, half of them remain respondent to stimulation, and activated synapses need to be closer than 1.5 μm to synergize in endocannabinoid signaling.

AB  - AbstractBackground
Depressive patients show cognitive impairments that are strongly associated with cortisol levels and hippocampus functioning that interact via unknown mechanisms. In addition, a relation between depression and hippocampal synaptic plasticity was described.
Methods
In the first experiment, strain-dependent effects of 72-h social isolation on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 area of the in vitro hippocampus, was determined. Extracellular field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were recorded and a brief high-frequency stimulation (100 Hz, 1 s) was applied and recording resumed after the high frequency stimulation (HFS) for 30 min to determine the effect of HFS.

In the second experiment we investigated the effect of 72 h of corticosterone treatment and the involvement of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) in the effect of 72 h of social isolation on LTP in the CA1 area of hippocampus, in vitro.
Results
Genetic background has a major effect on the level of hippocampal LTP impairment in mice following social isolation. Data showed that the potentiation levels in socially housed (SH) A/J mice were significantly higher than the SH C57BL/6J mice (224.88 ± 16.65, 131.56 ± 6.25% of the baseline values, t(9) = 2.648, p = 0.026). However, both strains showed depressed induction of potentiation when reared in an isolated environment for 72 h, and no significant difference was recorded between the two (112.88 ± 16.65%, and 117.91 ± 3.23% of the baseline values, respectively, t(10) = 0.618, p = 0.551). Social isolation increased corticosterone levels significantly and chronic corticosterone infusion in SH phenocopied the LTP impairments observed in socially isolated mice. Infusion of the GR antagonist RU38486 rescued the LTP-impairments following social isolation.
Conclusions
These findings support the notion that increased levels of stress hormone act via the GR on hippocampal functioning and that, in this way, the cognitive deficits in mood disorders may be restored.

AB  - Abstract
Exercising during pregnancy has been shown to improve spatial learning and short-term memory, as well as increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA levels and hippocampal cell survival in juvenile offspring. However, it remains unknown if these effects endure into adulthood. In addition, few studies have considered how maternal exercise can impact cognitive functions that do not rely on the hippocampus. To address these issues, the present study tested the effects of maternal exercise during pregnancy on object recognition memory, which relies on the perirhinal cortex (PER), in adult offspring. Pregnant rats were given access to a running wheel throughout gestation and the adult male offspring were subsequently tested in an object recognition memory task at three different time points, each spaced 2-weeks apart, beginning at 60 days of age. At each time point, offspring from exercising mothers were able to successfully discriminate between novel and familiar objects in that they spent more time exploring the novel object than the familiar object. The offspring of non-exercising mothers were not able to successfully discriminate between objects and spent an equal amount of time with both objects. A subset of rats was euthanized 1 h after the final object recognition test to assess c-FOS expression in the PER. The offspring of exercising mothers had more c-FOS expression in the PER than the offspring of non-exercising mothers. By comparison, c-FOS levels in the adjacent auditory cortex did not differ between groups. These results indicate that maternal exercise during pregnancy can improve object recognition memory in adult male offspring and increase c-FOS expression in the PER; suggesting that exercise during the gestational period may enhance brain function of the offspring.

AB  - Abstract
Obesity resistance due to elevated orexin signaling is accompanied by high levels of spontaneous physical activity (SPA). The behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying this observation have not been fully worked out. We determined the contribution of hypothalamic orexin receptors (OXRs) to SPA stimulated by orexin A (OXA), whether OXA-stimulated SPA was secondary to arousal and whether voluntary wheel running led to compensations in 24-h SPA. We further tested whether orexin action on dopamine one receptors (DA1R) in the substantia nigra (SN) plays an important role in the generation of SPA. To test this, SPA response was determined in lean and obese rats with cannulae targeted toward the rostral lateral hypothalamus (rLH) or SN. Sleep/wake states were also measured in rats with rLH cannula and electroencephalogram/electromyogram radiotelemetry transmitters. SPA in lean rats was more sensitive to antagonism of the OX1R and in the early response to the orexin 2 agonist. OXA increased arousal equally in lean and obese rodents, which is discordant from the greater SPA response in lean rats. Obesity-resistant rats ran more and wheel running was directly related to 24-h SPA levels. The OX1R antagonist, SB-334867-A, and the DA1R antagonist, SCH3390, in SN more effectively reduced SPA stimulated by OXA in obesity-resistant rats. These data suggest OXA-stimulated SPA is not secondary to enhanced arousal, propensity for SPA parallels inclination to run and that orexin action on dopaminergic neurons in SN may participate in the mediation of SPA and running wheel activity.

AB  - Abstract
One of the major consequences of stroke is brain injury caused by glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity. Glutamate-mediated excitatory activities are partially driven by β2-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (β2-nAChRs). In examining the role of β2-nAChRs in cerebral ischemic injury, excitotoxicity and stroke outcome, we found that deficiency of β2-nAChRs attenuated brain infarction and neurological deficit at 24 and 72 h after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Genetic deletion of β2-nAChRs associated with reduced terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL+) and cleaved caspase-3+ cells after MCAO, together with a reduction of extracellular glutamate and oxygen–glucose deprivation-induced increase of excitatory inputs in cortical neurons. Pharmacologic pretreatment with a selective β2-nAChRs antagonist reduced brain infarction, neurological deficit, and MCAO-induced glutamate release. These findings suggest that deficiency of β2-nAChRs, also achievable by pharmacological blockade, can decrease brain infarction and improve the neurological status in ischemic stroke. The improved outcome is associated with reduced extracellular glutamate level and lower excitatory inputs into ischemic neurons, suggesting a reduction of glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in the mechanisms of neuroprotection.

AB  - Abstract
Sound envelope plays a crucial role in perception: ramped sounds (slow attack and quick decay) are louder in strength and longer in subjective duration than damped sounds (quick attack and slow decay) even if they are equal in intensity and physical duration. To explain the asymmetrical perception, the perceptual constancy hypothesis supposes that the listener eliminates the slow decay of damped sounds from the judgment of perception, while the persistence of perception hypothesis supposes asymmetrical neural responses after the source has stopped. To understand neural mechanisms underlying the perceptual asymmetry, we explored response properties of the primary auditory cortex (A1) neurons during ramped and damped stimuli in awake cats. We found two distinct types of cells tuned to specific features of the sound envelope: edge cells sensitive to the temporal edge, such as quick attack and decay, while slope cells sensitive to slow attack and decay. The former needs a short (&lt;2.5 ms) period of stimulus duration for evoking maximal peak responses, while the latter needs a long (20 ms) period, suggesting that the timescale of processing underlies differential sensitivity between the cell types. The findings suggest that perceptual constancy is not yet be executed at A1 because the specific cells distinguishing the direction of amplitude change (attack or decay) are lacking in A1. On the other hand, there is evidence of persistence of perception: overall response duration during ramped sound reached 1.4 times longer than that during damped sound, originating mainly from the response asymmetry of the edge cell (sensitive to the quick decay of ramped sounds but not to the slow decay of damped sounds), and neuronal persistence of excitation after the termination of ramped sounds was substantially longer than that of damped sounds, corresponding to the psychological evidence of persistence of perception.

AB  - Abstract
Neurochemical features in sympathetic and afferent neurons are subject to change during development. Nitric oxide (NO) plays a developmental role in the nervous system. To better understand the neuroplasticity of sympathetic and afferent neurons during postnatal ontogenesis, the distribution of neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) immunoreactivity was studied in the sympathetic para- and prevertebral, nodose ganglion (NG) and Th2 and L4 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) from female Wistar rats of different ages (newborn, 10-day-old, 20-day-old, 30-day-old, 2-month-old, 6-month-old, 1-year-old, and 3-year-old).

nNOS-positive neurons were revealed in all sensory ganglia but not in sympathetic ones from birth onward. The percentage of nNOS-immunoreactive (IR) neurons increased during first 10 days of life from 41.3 to 57.6 in Th2 DRG, from 40.9 to 59.1 in L4 DRG and from 31.6 to 38.5 in NG. The percentage of nNOS-IR neurons did not change in the NG later during development and senescence. However, in Th2 and L4 DRG the proportion of nNOS-IR neurons was high in animals between 10 and 30 days of life and decreased up to the second month of life. In 2-month-old rats, the percentage of nNOS-IR neurons was 52.9 in Th2 DRG and 51.3 in L4 DRG. We did not find statistically significant differences in the percentage of nNOS-IR neurons between Th2 and L4 DRG and between young and aged rats.

In NG and DRG of 10-day-old and older rats, a high proportion of nNOS-IR neurons binds isolectin B4. In newborn animals, only 41.3%, 45.3% and 28.4% of nNOS neuron profiles bind to IB4 in Th2, L4 DRG and NG, respectively. In 10-day-old and older rats, the number of sensory nNOS-IR neurons binding IB4 reached more than 90% in DRG and more than 80% in NG. Only a small number of nNOS-positive cells showed immunoreactivity to calcitonin gene-related peptide, neurofilament 200, calretinin. The information provided here will also serve as a basis for future studies investigating mechanisms of the development of sensory neurons.

AB  - Abstract
The mood-stabilizing drug lithium is the most commonly used treatment for bipolar disorder. Previous studies have shown that chronic treatment with lithium produces a protective effect against oxidative stress. Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a gene transcription factor that binds to the electrophile response element (EpRE) and triggers expression of various genes with antioxidant properties. Nrf2 contributes significantly to cytoprotection against oxidative stress. The purpose of this study is to determine the role of Nrf2 in the protective effect of lithium against oxidative stress. We found, using immunoblotting analysis, that chronic, but not acute treatment with lithium increased nuclear levels of Nrf2 in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells. DNA pull-down assay has shown that Nrf2 can bind to a double-strained oligonucleotide containing an EpRE site from glutathione s-transferase A4. Electrophorectic gel shift analysis further showed that chronic treatment with lithium increased Nrf-2–EpRE binding activity. We also found that knocking down Nrf2 with its short hairpin RNA inhibited lithium-increased expression of Nrf2 and suppressed the protective effect of lithium against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-reduced cell viability and H2O2-increased DNA fragmentation. Because Nrf2 can induce expression of various genes that play important roles in cytoprotection, the current findings suggest that Nrf2 may mediate the neuroprotective effect of lithium against oxidative stress.

We investigated in this study the pharmacological properties of AC-3933 (5-(3-methoxyphenyl)-3-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-1,6-naphthyridin-2(1H)-one), a novel benzodiazepine receptor (BzR) partial inverse agonist. AC-3933 potently inhibited [3H]-flumazenil binding to rat whole brain membrane with a Ki value of 5.15 ± 0.39 nM and a GABA ratio of 0.84 ± 0.03. AC-3933 exhibited almost no affinity for the other receptors, transporters and ion channels used in this study. In addition, AC-3933, in the presence of GABA (1 μM), gradually but significantly increased [35S] tert-butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding to rat cortical membrane to 117.1% of the control (maximum increase ratio) at 3000 nM. However, this increase reached a plateau at 30 nM with hardly any change at a concentration range of 100–3000 nM (from 115.2% to 117.1%). AC-3933 (0.1–10 μM) significantly enhanced KCl-evoked acetylcholine (ACh) release from rat hippocampal slices in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, in vivo brain microdialysis showed that intragastric administration of AC-3933 at the dose of 10 mg/kg significantly increased extracellular ACh levels in the hippocampus of freely moving rats (area under the curve (AUC0–2 h) of ACh level; 288.3% of baseline). These results indicate that AC-3933, a potent and selective BzR inverse agonist with low intrinsic activity, might be useful in the treatment of cognitive disorders associated with degeneration of the cholinergic system.

AB  - Abstract
Allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) belongs to a class of pregnane neurosteroidal compounds that enhance brain inhibition by interacting directly with GABAA signaling, mainly through an increase in tonic inhibitory current. Here, we addressed the role of THDOC in the modulation of interictal- and ictal-like activity and associated high-frequency oscillations (HFOs, 80–500 Hz; ripples: 80–200 Hz, fast ripples: 250–500 Hz) recorded in vitro in the rat piriform cortex, a highly excitable brain structure that is implicated in seizure generation and maintenance. We found that THDOC: (i) increased the duration of interictal discharges in the anterior piriform cortex while decreasing ictal discharge duration in both anterior and posterior piriform cortices; (ii) reduced the occurrence of HFOs associated to both interictal and ictal discharges; and (iii) prolonged the duration of 4-aminopyridine-induced, glutamatergic independent synchronous field potentials that are known to mainly result from the activation of GABAA receptors. Our results indicate that THDOC can modulate epileptiform synchronization in the piriform cortex presumably by potentiating GABAA receptor-mediated signaling. This evidence supports the view that neurosteroids regulate neuronal excitability and thus control the occurrence of seizures.

AB  - Abstract
In the trigeminal ganglion (TG), satellite glial cells (SGCs) form a functional unit with neurons. It has been proposed that SGCs participate in regulating extracellular glutamate levels and that dysfunction of this SGC capacity can impact nociceptive transmission in craniofacial pain conditions. This study investigated whether SGCs release glutamate and whether elevation of TG glutamate concentration alters response properties of trigeminal afferent fibers. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess glutamate content and the expression of excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT)1 and EAAT2 in TG sections. SGCs contained glutamate and expressed EAAT1 and EAAT2. Potassium chloride (10 mM) was used to evoke glutamate release from cultured rat SGCs treated with the EAAT1/2 inhibitor (3S)-3-[[3-[[4-(trifluoromethyl)ben zoyl]amino]phenyl]methoxy]-l-aspartic acid (TFB-TBOA) or control. Treatment with TFB-TBOA (1 and 10 μM) significantly reduced the glutamate concentration from 10.6 ± 1.1 to 5.8 ± 1.4 μM and 3.0 ± 0.8 μM, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). Electrophysiology experiments were conducted in anaesthetized rats to determine the effect of intraganglionic injections of glutamate on the response properties of ganglion neurons that innervated either the temporalis or masseter muscle. Intraganglionic injection of glutamate (500 mM, 3 μl) evoked afferent discharge and significantly reduced muscle afferent mechanical threshold. Glutamate-evoked discharge was attenuated by the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV) and increased by TFB-TBOA, whereas mechanical sensitization was only sensitive to APV. Antidromic invasion of muscle afferent fibers by electrical stimulation of the caudal brainstem (10 Hz) or local anesthesia of the brainstem with lidocaine did not alter glutamate-induced mechanical sensitization. These findings provide a novel mechanism whereby dysfunctional trigeminal SGCs could contribute to cranial muscle tenderness in craniofacial pain conditions such as migraine headache.

AB  - Abstract
Nogo-A is a transmembrane protein originally discovered in myelin, produced by postnatal CNS oligodendrocytes. Nogo-A induces growth cone collapse and inhibition of axonal growth in the injured adult CNS. In the intact CNS, Nogo-A functions as a negative regulator of growth and plasticity. Nogo-A is also expressed by certain neurons. Neuronal Nogo-A depresses long-term potentiation in the hippocampus and modulates neurite adhesion and fasciculation during development in mice. Here we show that Nogo-A is present in neurons derived from human midbrain (Lund human mesencephalic (LUHMES) cell line), as well as in embryonic and postnatal mouse midbrain (dopaminergic) neurons. In LUHMES cells, Nogo-A was upregulated threefold upon differentiation and neurite extension. Nogo-A was localized intracellularly in differentiated LUHMES cells. Cultured midbrain (dopaminergic) neurons from Nogo-A knock-out mice exhibited decreased numbers of neurites and branches when compared with neurons from wild-type (WT) mice. However, this phenotype was not observed when the cultures from WT mice were treated with an antibody neutralizing plasma membrane Nogo-A. In vivo, neither the regeneration of nigrostriatal tyrosine hydroxylase fibers, nor the survival of nigral dopaminergic neurons after partial 6-hydroxydopamine lesions was affected by Nogo-A deletion. These results indicate that during maturation of cultured midbrain (dopaminergic) neurons, intracellular Nogo-A supports neurite growth initiation and branch formation.

AB  - Abstract
Under normal conditions, the acoustic pitch percept of a pure tone is determined mainly by the tonotopic place of the stimulation along the cochlea. Unlike acoustic stimulation, electric stimulation of a cochlear implant (CI) allows for the direct manipulation of the place of stimulation in human subjects. CI sound processors analyze the range of frequencies needed for speech perception and allocate portions of this range to the small number of electrodes distributed in the cochlea. Because the allocation is assigned independently of the original resonant frequency of the basilar membrane associated with the location of each electrode, CI users who have access to residual hearing in either or both ears often have tonotopic mismatches between the acoustic and electric stimulation. Here we demonstrate plasticity of place pitch representations of up to three octaves in Hybrid CI users after experience with combined electro-acoustic stimulation. The pitch percept evoked by single CI electrodes, measured relative to acoustic tones presented to the non-implanted ear, changed over time in directions that reduced the electro-acoustic pitch mismatch introduced by the CI programming. This trend was particularly apparent when the allocations of stimulus frequencies to electrodes were changed over time, with pitch changes even reversing direction in some subjects. These findings show that pitch plasticity can occur more rapidly and on a greater scale in the mature auditory system than previously thought possible. Overall, the results suggest that the adult auditory system can impose perceptual order on disordered arrays of inputs.

AB  - Abstract
α-Synuclein is the major component of Lewy bodies. α-Synuclein phosphorylated at Ser 129 (Phospho-α-Syn) is the most common synuclein modification observed in Parkinson’s disease pathology and transgenic animal models. Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) was previously proposed as an important kinase in α-synuclein phosphorylation at Ser129. To better understand the role of PLK2 in α-synuclein phosphorylation in vivo, we further evaluated the effect of PLK2 genetic knockdown and pharmacological inhibition on Phospho-α-Syn levels in different brain regions of PLK2 knockout (KO), heterozygous (Het) and wild-type (WT) mice. Whereas PLK2 knockdown had no effect on Total-α-synuclein brain levels, it resulted in a gene-dosage dependent, albeit incomplete, reduction of endogenous Phospho-α-Syn levels in all brain regions investigated. No compensatory induction of other α-synuclein kinases (PLK3, casein kinase-2, G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) and GRK6) was observed at the mRNA level in the PLK2 KO mouse brain. To determine whether increased activity of another PLK family member is responsible for the residual Phospho-α-Syn levels in the PLK2 KO mouse brain, the pan-PLK inhibitor BI 2536 was tested in PLK2 KO mice. Whereas BI 2536 reduced Phospho-α-Syn levels in WT mice, it did not further reduce the residual endogenous Phospho-α-Syn levels in PLK2 KO and Het mice, suggesting that a kinase other than PLK1–3 accounts for the remaining PLK inhibitor-resistant pool in the mouse brain. Moreover, PLK3 KO in mice had no effect on both Total- and Phospho-α-Syn brain levels. These results support a significant role for a PLK kinase in phosphorylating α-synuclein at Ser129 in the brain, and suggest that PLK2 is responsible for this activity under physiological conditions.

AB  - Abstract
This study was designed to examine the effect of voluntary exercise on hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in morphine-dependent rats. The rats were randomly distributed into the saline–sedentary (Sal/Sed), the dependent–sedentary, the saline–exercise (Sal/Exc), and the dependent–exercise (D/Exc) groups. The Sal/Exc and the D/Exc groups were allowed to freely exercise in a running wheel for 10 days. The Sal/Sed and the morphine–sedentary groups were kept sedentary for the same extent of time. Morphine (10 mg/kg) was injected bi-daily (12 h interval) during 10 days of voluntary exercise. On day 11, 2 h after the morphine injection, the in vivo LTP in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was examined. The theta frequency primed bursts were delivered to the perforant path for induction of LTP. Population spike (PS) amplitude and the field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSP) slope were measured as indices of increase in synaptic efficacy. Chronic morphine increased the mean basal EPSP, and augmented PS–LTP. Exercise significantly increased the mean baseline EPSP and PS responses, and augmented PS–LTP in both saline and morphine-treated groups. Moreover, the increase of PS–LTP in the morphine–exercise group was greater (22.5%), but not statistically significant, than that of the Sal/Exc group. These results may imply an additive effect between exercise and morphine on mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. Such an interaction between exercise and chronic morphine may influence cognitive functions in opiate addicts.

AB  - Abstract
Whole-cell or cell-attached analysis was carried out in dopamine (DA) D2 receptor (D2R) knock-out (KO) mice to elucidate the function of this receptor in the regulation of GABAergic synaptic transmission onto striatal cholinergic interneurons as well as their spontaneous firing. In slice preparation obtained from wild-type mice, evoked GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) showed frequency-dependent suppression, and this suppression significantly decreased in the presence of a D2-like receptor antagonist or in D2R KO mice. Contribution of N-type calcium channel was also significantly reduced in the striatal cholinergic interneurons of the D2R KO mice compared with that in the wild-type mice. Spontaneous firing of striatal cholinergic interneurons was inhibited by 5- or 10-Hz stimulation, and the suppression was decreased in the presence of a D2-like receptor antagonist or in D2R KO mice. These findings substantiate the physiological role of D2R in the regulation of GABAergic synaptic transmission onto striatal cholinergic interneurons as well as their excitability, confirming the tight coupling between D2R and N-type calcium channels in the regulation of GABA release.

AB  - Abstract
Opioids are the most widely used analgesics in the treatment of severe acute and chronic pain. However, opioids have many adverse side effects, including the development of antinociceptive tolerance after long-term use. The antinociceptive tolerance of opioids has limited their clinical use. A recent study has reported that autophagy is responsible for morphine-induced neuronal injury. However, little is known about the role of autophagy in morphine antinociceptive tolerance. In the present study, chronic morphine administration was found to induce the expression of autophagy-related proteins, including Beclin1 and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-II, in GABAergic interneurons in the superficial layer (lamina I–II) of the spinal cord. A single intrathecal administration of autophagy inhibitors, 3-methyladenine (3MA) or wortmannin, inhibited the development of antinociceptive tolerance in a dose-dependent manner. Autophagy in the lamina I–II neurons was associated with increased level of cathepsin B (CatB), a lysosomal cysteine protease. The pharmacological blockade or gene deletion of CatB markedly prevented the development of morphine antinociceptive tolerance. Furthermore, the intrathecal administration of 3MA suppressed the upregulation of CatB 5 days after morphine administration. Finally, CatB deficiency inhibited the increased release probability of glutamate in the lamina I neurons after chronic morphine treatment. These observations suggest that the dysfunction of the spinal GABAergic system induced by CatB-dependent excessive autophagy is partly responsible for morphine antinociceptive tolerance following chronic treatment.
